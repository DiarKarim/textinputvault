I wanted to use my quest 3 with this PC white build, and I had success with connecting the quest 3 and this white PC; however before this white PC I had my main all [black PC](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/6gYid9H) that I used my valve index.\n\nI would like to use the index controllers with my quest 3 for the reason of having better tracking.\n\nSo I take my 4 steamvr dongles and plug them into my white PC.\n\nI connect my quest 3 to my white PC via steam link.\n\nI go to pair the index controllers in the steamvr drop down menu.\n\nWhen in the pairing menu, it displays [this](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/2diZfEY).\n\nWith this problem I am wondering if the dongles are not being detected by the PC or if the donlges are not good anymore. So I turn on my valve index on my black PC and connect my index controllers AND my vive trackers that connect to the steamvr dongles. They all connect and display perfectly in steamvr.\n\nNext I try connecting my valve index to my white PC to see if there would be any differences. After running steamvr through the valve index on my white PC I am given the [normal pairing screen](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3YJxhaq).

Getting a 108 error (headset not detected). I've had the headset for 3 years and the message would appear once or twice and a simple unplug and plug back in did the trick. Must admit the headset mainly comes out for Christmas time but is carefully put away every time. I tried starting it up at the beginning of December and the message came up. Tried the old unplug trick but nothing was happening after an hour. Went through some steps of going through \"Developer settings\", The power supply looked to be working as I was getting the two blue lights on the front of the headset. I could see the headset in the device manager as \"Generic Superspeed USB Hub\" so assumed this was correct. And disabled the \"Direct Display\" and the headset does work as a second monitor so again assumed the display-port was fine too. Looked through other posts and some were saying that the tether cable is the fault. Looking at mine there has always been a bit of a kink in the end and thought maybe after a few years something has gone in it. So ordered a new complete cable (from the PC to the headset). When it arrived what I found was the old cable wasn't making any sounds with windows but when I tried the new one, windows made a little sound saying it detected a new USB device. Unfortunately, nothing happened so I tried steam support. They came back with the usual messages of going through \"Developer settings\" and I tried all their methods but no luck. I started to look at the power supply as when I unplugged it the transformer inside sounded a bit funny, not the usual humming you get from other transformers. So I ordered another in hope. It came but still nothing different happened. I'm basically out of ideas, if anyone can help with this issue I'd be most grateful.

I've been working on a very simple \"hello, world\" overlay for OpenVR in C++ and for whatever reason the overlay refuses to appear within VR. Now, I initially assumed I was just not programming it right so I began to search the internet for the very few examples that exist. The first was from this reddit page several years ago ([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/dtmfbt\/openvr\\_overlay\\_sample\\_application\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/dtmfbt\/openvr_overlay_sample_application\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) and the second was an example written in C using the openvr\\_capi.h instead of the standard header ([https:\/\/gist.github.com\/cnlohr\/6e452dc6cc2df7f48d5ade66059358d9](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/cnlohr\/6e452dc6cc2df7f48d5ade66059358d9)). That developer used the same \"rawdraw\\_sf.h\" header as me throughout the program. With the first example my only change to the code was the file location, and I didn't change the second example at all. And yet, neither showed up in VR. Notably, all three programs (my own, the reddit example, and the github example) would open steam VR on launch, and both my program and the github example react in the terminal to a remote turning on. So now my best guess is that, for whatever reason, OpenVR overlays are not appearing in SteamVR games. For reference, I am on a windows mixed reality headset.

I initially didn't plan to make any posts for the in-dev NewUI branch releases, but it's been quite a while (November 2021 I think?) and the big 3.0 release is still a bit further out. Desktop viewing tools are all the rage again too it seems, so I thought it might be a good idea to write about what I've been up to lately.\n\nAs you or may not know, Desktop+ is a free and open-source desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.  \nTo get it right out of the way, if you have no issues with SteamVR's built-in desktop or have one of the commercial offerings, there's probably not much in it for you. Can't offer detailed comparisons since I'm not a user of those other applications, though.\n\nThe NewUI branch of Desktop+ is an effort to offer a more user-friendly interface with additional features stacked on top. New additions pretty much only go here unless they're very trivial to backport to the stable branch. I've been releasing preview builds every now and then since I started working in this.  \nAside from a new coat of paint, it also adds the following:\n\n- Floating settings windows (can be moved anywhere and pinned to use outside of dashboard)\n- Translation support (currently ships with English &amp; German)\n- Fully custom keyboard (layouts are user-definable, currently ships with US-QWERTY &amp; German QWERTZ, also improved input simulation)\n- Custom laser pointer (non-blocking input outside of dashboard, multi-laser input on keyboard)\n- Overlay Bar (better overlay management)\n- Window listing\/management improvements (window state tracking, auto-hiding\/restoration)\n- Better overlay creation (directly select source, drag window out of desktop overlay, get active window from Floating UI)\n- Auto-docking\n- Better Floating UI design (works with any curvature setting)\n- Capture FPS display\n- CEF-based web browser overlays (requires separate [Desktop+ browser component](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlusBrowser\/releases) installed or to be on \"NewUI Preview + Browser\" branch on Steam)\n- Keyboard auto-visibility (appears automatically when focusing a text input field)\n- Customizable drag behavior (force upright orientation\/fixed distance\/snap position)\n- HMD Floor Position origin can optionally spin with user\n- Application profiles (automatically switch overlay profile from SteamVR app launch, trigger actions on start\/exit)\n- Overlay position locking\n- ...and more, probably\n\nIf you're interested in the long version of this, you can start your journey with the [NewUI Preview 1 Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460?emclan=103582791468837125&amp;emgid=2984183718087120350) and work your way up from there. Most posts come with pretty video clips too, so there's those if you don't like reading.  \nOnly a handful of features are still missing compared to the old stable branch at this point, so my general recommendation would be to use the NewUI branch if you're not relying on those.\n\nWith the NewUI branch introduction out of the way, here's what's new in NewUI Preview 10 (compared to 9):\n\n**New:**\n\n- Added application profiles\n- Added overlay position locking\n- Added workarounds for invalid SteamVR dashboard state on launch\n- Floating UI now displays the overlay name when the output is invalid (i.e. window capture lost)\n- \"Focus Window when Pointing at Overlay\" and \"Focus Game when Laser Pointer leaves Overlay\" are now applied to the VR keyboard as well if the focused overlay is a window overlay\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Performance Monitor now caps most performance values to their maximum &amp; ignores very small decimals for average FPS display\n- Floating UI no longer uses fixed sizing for primary dashboard overlay fallback if isn't positioned close to the dashboard\n- Reverted Desktop+ laser pointer workaround from New UI Preview 9 (underlying issue was fixed with SteamVR Beta 1.25.3)\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fixed total desktop cropping size not being set in desktop mode\n- Fixed browser navigation state not being restored after restarting UI process\n- Fixed \"To HMD\" button being offset for dashboard origin overlays\n- Fixed Floating UI initially being position incorrectly after the capture was lost on a window overlay\n- Various other minor UI fixes and adjustments\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/3649639958566433176).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nDesktop+ is a free and open-source project I'm working on in my spare time. If you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).\n\nThat's it I think. I'm still working on the thing and not all that much is happening in the PCVR space... so business as usual.  \nLet me know if you have any questions or run into trouble.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":101936,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desktop+ NewUI Preview 10 now available","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/10ufxf2\/desktop_newui_preview_10_now_available\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"hobb_goblinson","author_created_utc":1620686625,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_c22vsmsa","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1672785396,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"102ltlx","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_102ltlx","no_follow":true,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/102ltlx\/steamvr_with_virtual_desktop_on_quest_2_helpgreat\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676249162,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Some context: Using a Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop. SteamVR performance test says my system goes above necessary requirements for most VR games (CPU: 5800x, GPU: 5600xt, 16GB RAM). My router is also pretty beefy as far as I know, it's an ASUS RT-AX58U. VD lists it as 1200mbps in the performance stats, and I set it to use 160mhz bandwidth on the 5ghz channel. It's in the same room as the rest of my setup, and only my headset + PC are using the 5GHz channel. PC is wired in via ethernet.\n\nSo when using VD it works flawlessly--way better experience than I had with Air Link, and worth the $20. About 20ms latency, perfect resolution. However as soon as I launch SteamVR the latency increases to around 40-50ms. Not awful but a sign of what's to come.\n\nAs soon as I launch ANY game, or even the Steam Home VR environment, latency jumps to anywhere between 100-400ms. This is obviously unusable and I become motion sick moments after it occurs. According to the VD performance overlay, this jump in latency is coming from the \"networking\" and \"encoding\" categories.\n\nI've already tried setting the graphics to the lowest settings and I've been keeping the VR bitrate at 10mbps while I try to figure it out. SteamVR resolution is set at 100%, it's not trying to boost it. Seems like the bottleneck is in my networking setup but again, I think my router is more than capable.\n\nIt's frustrating since it seems like I'm right on the edge of getting it to work.

When I play VR however, my CPU tends to struggle heavily, stuttering every once in a while but *most* games can still hit 120Hz, with major settings adjustments I can deal with. HL:A is the exception, it never goes above 72Hz on average, sometimes spiking to 100Hz, but only for a few frames. My task manager shows that HL:A is only using at max 30% of my CPU, so I don't understand how the frametimes could be in the 10ms, sometimes 15-16ms.

I want to know if there's a way to bump it to 144fps to match the Valve Index's refresh rate.  \n\n\n**EDIT:** *SOLVED!* Found this little tool, [Indirect Display Driver Sample](https:\/\/github.com\/ge9\/IddSampleDriver).  \n\\---  \nSo I've recently gone down a little rabbit hole of wanting to play my usual flat screen games in a virtual environment. I started with Destiny 2 with my two monitors set up to be ultrawide in Nvidia-surround, and played through Virtual Desktop. It was honestly pretty great on my Index and I had a lot of fun with it. However it dawned upon me that I'm sort of doubling the amount of work that my graphics card has to do as the game is being rendered on both my dual screen desktop, and on both panels in the headset.\n\nSo I did a little digging and found this little thing called [AMYUNI](https:\/\/www.amyuni.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=3030), ([video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ybHKFZjSkVY)) it allows you to create virtual, non mirrored monitors with a little bit of fiddling through command prompt, and if you decided to dive deeper, you can do some registry edits and set whatever resolution you want. So I did 7680 x 1440 *(which would be a triple monitor setup for me)* and the field of view I got was awesome. I could even disconnect my actual monitors and *just use* the one stupid-long virtual monitor if I wanted to. There's one thing though, the virtual monitors are locked in at 60fps, which is real noticeable with screens strapped to your face. Whenever I was using Nvidia-surround, I could get the full 144fps of the index, but now I'm stuck at 60 as the rate can't be changed in Windows Display Settings and Nvidia Control Panel won't detect the virtual monitor.\n\nSo I did even more digging and found this program called [CRU](https:\/\/www.monitortests.com\/forum\/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU), which is something that people use to get a little bit more frames out of their monitors *(which I didn't know was possible)* though sometimes at the expense of resolution. I felt like I was on the right track as the program detected the virtual monitor- however- I have no idea how to use the tool for this absurd situation I'm working with\/ around. And from what little I could figure out, it doesn't seem to like the settings I was going for.\n\nSo my question to whoever decided to read through this wall of text, is there a way to perhaps set a registry edit for the virtual monitor so I can set a 144fps rate that'll match the Index? or perhaps make Nvidia Control Panel detect the virtual monitor so it can be managed through it?

Playing games with the knuckles isn't a problem, but as soon as I do something that causes interaction with SteamVR itself, the issues surface. Examples:\n\n1. Entering text (VR games usually call out to SteamVR to open a text-input window)\n2. Opening the SteamVR menu window (e.g. to look at controller bindings)\n3. Exiting the game\n\nAll of these things cause the game I'm playing at the time to be unusable. None of these issues manifests if I use my old wands, so I think SteamVR and the knuckles controllers are the most likely culprits. I originally bought the complete HTC Vive Pro 2 kit, but recently I bought a pair of knuckles. I find the knuckles better for most games, but in the last month this problem emerged (I'd suspect something in recent SteamVR updates to be the cause). Because I still had the wands, I was able to swap back to them to test things and all the problems went away as soon as I did this.\n\nSo I'm curious to know if other knuckles users are seeing these kinds of problems. If so, I'd be even more curious to know what headset they are using, since there's always a possibility it's a poor interaction between the Valve controllers and the Vive headset that wouldn't be an issue if I had nothing but Valve gear.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":96154,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Valve knuckles causing SteamVR instability?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.83,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/wt4bu4\/valve_knuckles_causing_steamvr_instability\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"joindemand","author_created_utc":1411262352,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_ihsc1","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1660992972,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"wt4b02","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"c441a616-1b98-11ec-bb0b-c65b6a53b653","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_wt4b02","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/wt4b02\/advise_needed_for_poor_tracking_and_redoing_my\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1662805189,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hello everyone here!

Games that are barely games, they aren't even to a standard to use them as an internal development pitch. \n\nYes I know VR is in early days, and people don't want to cripple any possible development that might lead to something, or at least thats the impression VR youtubers give me, because I haven't heard anyone say a single bad word about a single VR game, barring maybe walking dead onslaught, and I think thats because we already got walking dead saints and sinners before it. \n\nbut its becoming increasingly frustrating trying to find genuine reviews for games, everyone in the space is so insincerely positive its starting to feel like NFT bros or some shit, with ulterior motives. \n\nbut this is a problem for VR, if we can't sort the good from the bad, a kid with his 1-2 games a year might waste his money on an awful game, and never come back to VR, or VR developers aren't inclined to fix their game, and they move on to another project.\n\nLook I get it, I do, with VR we accept compromises thats the deal right, we get more immersion, we trade in good graphics, thats a given, we get smaller studios, less polish, and QA in VR must be a nightmare not just because the head sets are so different, but also because people (bad eyesight, short, tall, fat, fit, ect ect ect) are so different...i understand its not easy. \n\nI go into a VR game expecting to trade a lot of what I am used to in pancake games, for some better immersion so I don't mind.\n\nlet me give examples.\n\n* **Borderlands 2 VR**, ok, we won't get borderlands 2, there has to be cutbacks for VR, but it doesn't even have co-op which I'd say is a large % of what I'd get out of playing borderlands... but is the VR good enough to accept that tradeoff? No! the cinematics are cinema bench cut scenes, not immersive, the weapon controls are awful, you don't get the benefit of dual wielding it just doesn't feel like a very good VR game either but these guys are selling it for 50$ , the HUD IS off to the side, but if you turn your head to look at them, they move with it, they are impossible to look at. basic QA would resolve that.\n\n\n* **after the fall** I had high hopes for this, a 2nd generation VR game, the Devs made Arizona sunshine and while the game has flaws now, it was one of the first better VR games, you'd think they would have learned a lot in the last few years. but no, in fact all the same mistakes show up. the weapons and manual reloads are janky the accuracy to reload my gun VS. hand placement is so unforgiving, I can't reload my guns with index controllers, I physically can't get them close enough together. I still get pushed out of objects and away from things, when reaching for items, like an item on a table, reaching for it causes some collision pushback ...the physical player box  can't fit into very reasonable spaces (bathrooms on the first map come to mind) and this is also one of those games that onboards you for 30 mins before letting you even consider looking at some options (I hate snap turn) this is a game that also sells for 40$-50$ with a 5$ DLC it has nearly 1400 reviews, mostly positive. its not worth 10$ and even at 10$ i'd not recommend it to anyone. its been out 6 months so if they were going to fix the reloading issue, you'd expect that to be done by now.\n\n* **wardust** this is a 21$ game by a company thats already moved onto another janky unfinished project. nothing in this game worked. the UI was awful, the controls were awful, the functionality was awful, the bugs were awful. The AI was actually good, they could run&amp;gun, drive and fly pretty well. this game was unplayable, but has nearly 1400 mostly positive or very positive reviews on steam, the devs are already working on another project. I picked this up because a youtube reviewer sang its praise, while calling it \"janky\" it was implied comical physics, not unplayable unfinished game. \n\nThe information and resources out there for people to buy games for VR are badly lacking, and its why shitty erotic VR games populate the \"popular &amp; upcoming\" lists for VR on steam\n\nFor context, into the radius, a game I'd say is top 5 all time, up there with HL:alyx, boneworks and walking dead saint and sinners...has like 4k reviews, positive and overwhelmingly positive...even if you don't like into the radius, to does exactly what it sets out to do, and well, everything works as intended. but going by \"overwhelmingly positive\" that and wardust are indistinguishable  \n\nso my point is, even if you stop playing a game, because its functionally broken, please review the game indicating as such, I know I have been closing games, and never playing them again or thinking about them, and its a disservice to everyone else out there.  \n\nI have over 100 VR games with 20 installed, and the ones I don't play are for very good reasons, so I have some work to do about catching up on my reviews for all of those games, I think the VR community deserves that much.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":95256,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Request to everyone reading this, review your games on steam, even if you only played for 3mins and the controls were bad so you quit, let everyone know.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/vwvqlz\/request_to_everyone_reading_this_review_your\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"arkmario","author_created_utc":1463172565,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_xws0g","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1656349505,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vm0d5d","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vm0d5d","no_follow":true,"num_comments":3,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/vm0d5d\/steam_vr_games_freeze_on_quest_2\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657085302,"retrieved_utc":1657085302,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Context: Hi.

There are a few more games needed to be added to the list (more keep being added as well) but they are currently downloading as the list was the biggest this time around, but sadly most disappointing (no 4.5+ or higher this time around).  Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.  This does not work correctly for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down Fast VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1956860\/Down_Fast_VR\/\n\nThis bicycle game keeps drifting me to the left-side, no button seems to work (and it's not my controllers).  I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.  I am unable to get started in this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRANDMA**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1727550\/GRANDMA\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?).  Not sure If I wanted to play this one anyway from that cover\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hyperstacks**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1046760\/Hyperstacks\/\n\nI can't get the dash to work with the Index Controllers (little mini-jumps) and can't complete the tutorial.  It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":94016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/vc9x2v\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"DerNeo","author_created_utc":1456518385,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_vm2fa","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1653744415,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":1653783691.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"uznbub","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_metadata":{"x5stx8mlx7291":{"e":"Image","id":"x5stx8mlx7291","m":"image\/png","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0bc7b937afb83cb850559a19e1df6bb5f2943e5","x":108,"y":64},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfc9ee1bd150e41100278e3c17568aa5bff47d57","x":216,"y":129},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=816e14eceed36c2c4f266739c2674198bce47ecc","x":320,"y":192},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b33d956f02514a9bbb6d6af117b5d95a9301333","x":640,"y":384},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63feb4e71e38f14ee0a90463223793716726203","x":960,"y":576}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x5stx8mlx7291.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fe8bf9a5ada8c92c7b4700d12ccefdeed9bee8e","x":1015,"y":609},"status":"valid"}},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_uznbub","no_follow":true,"num_comments":3,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/uznbub\/pico_neo_3_link_steamvr_error_435_in_dp_mode\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1653916801,"retrieved_utc":1653916801,"score":8,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"**\\[FIXED\\]** *Some other guy tell me :*\n\n\"I have the same issue, but only when switching to 90hz in the the headset, via the Link app. Runs fine with 72hz.

The main goal is to finally finalize that today letting me then see which user reports are worth investigating and which are not. Once I have my list twm and Tuesday will focus on replicating the issues that were found to be significant. The good news is that I finally have enough responces to potentially look into rebar on nvidia. The current issues I wont be able to look into because of not enough reposnces are AMD vs Nvidia GPUs, weather or not nvidia GFE causes issues (Since I dont have alot of people with it uninstalled), weather antivirus software causes issues, weather HDR causes issues, weather HVCI causes issues, or weather ReBar on AMD causes issues. But with that I can list now all the things I plan on investigating and its a doozy of a list. HAGS on\/off, Windows 10 vs 11, Steam VR priority, VBS, RGB Apps, Chatting Apps, ReBar on Nvidia, Intel Based systems vs AMD based systems, Single vs Multiple Monitors, FPS Vr Windows 11 fix, Ryzen CCX complexes (1 vs 2), and Memory OC. If you want to continue to follow my progress from here on out later today ill be making a temporary google site that'll show which results from the survey are significant and what have i found. I also plan in about a week or 2 posting a new post here on reddit with my preliminary findings. Hopefully I can get to the bottom of this issue for users. Mentally I'm here: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/PDE9b5iU8vI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PDE9b5iU8vI)\n\nDay 5: This will be my last daily update for awhile, I have some results. The main things as of right now are for those experiencing issues to try going down to only one monitor and to turn of hardware accelerated GPU scheduling. I also am still in the early stages of what's becoming the largest part of this investigation and will take the most time the windows scheduler investigation. I hope to confirm that a program like project lasso can control how windows interacts with all this stuff. The main thing on that is to set all VR stuff to high priority and to ensure windows dynamic scheduling is set to off. My hope is to have more information soon. I plan to have my first update post on April 13th, with the results so far what I have found and what's left to be done. Please do the survey like I keep saying. Ill be posting updates as comments and in the google spreadsheet from here on out.\n\nI have some good leads and basically confirmed today that HAGS and multiple monitors can cause issues. I also noted that taking steamVR out of focus on windows 11 tanks its priority causing stuttering. Further testing revealed that using a program such as process lasso to force high priority all the time resolved the issue. ReBar is twms project along with memory OC. Will still update this post as trying to put together a google site failed.\n\nDay 6: this entirely blew past me, but the constant pink lines issue has now a steamVR beta update 1.22.5 that has fixed the issue. In my testing SteamVR now works on windows 11 with HAGS disabled. This means for all intents and purposes this survey is basically dead as that's the issue this was trying to solve. If the SteamVR beta doesn't help anyone please let me know, otherwise the direction of the report has shifted to settings users should try in the event they are still having issues. I'm glad the issues fixed and I'm glad valve fixed it. Thanks to  u\/miguel_cdlg and u\/aleiby for finding and fixing the windows 11 issues.\n\nI shouldn't say its dead users are still having issues its just the major one has been fixed. The new reality of the report will be a series of setting I found that affect VR performance and should be tried for users havening issues. For those experiencing system and game and vr crashes, this is most likely a hardware issue. For those experiencing occasional stuttering please update your drivers. Otherwise the final report will mostly mention the work I did on the last official release of SteamVR and suggest a series of diagnostic steps for users to try before they reach out to SteamVR support. I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of much help to the community.\n\nDay 7: Man day 6 sounded depressing, sorry for that. Anyways the reality is I will have some new settings for people to try after my results. While the main stuttering issue is resolved, I do think about it like a stability thing. It'll be like steamVR works when the systems stable and doing fine but these things agitate it just enough to potentially cause issues. I'm going on a trip for the next couple of days and am mostly focusing on making the first draft of the report. Hopefully I can still add some value to the community. This post is getting really messy so will make a formal update post sometime next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Day my fellow SteamVR users. My name is Sdrft1, and for a little background I have B.S. In Biochemistry and have specific coursework to data collection and interpretation using statistical methods. In this regard and after seeing countless Windows 11 VR threads go down in smoke with debates between those with working installs and those without working installs I've decided it would be best to bring some science to the table. In basic TLDR fashion I'm taking a survey to try and find what may be causing issues while Using SteamVR in windows 11 and what we as a community can do to fix it and provide concrete guidance to help with those experiencing issues. The main issue we are trying to solve can be found in this thread here: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa\\_dont\\_upgrade\\_to\\_windows\\_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa_dont_upgrade_to_windows_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3)\n\nTo start I want to say if you are on windows 11 and experiencing no issues, that's great! I would still love your response so I can determine what might be causing issues by comparing those with issues to those without issues.\n\nIf your experiencing issues, I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be frustrating to not be able to use something you paid for, and I feel you. If you could also answer my survey that would be great as well.\n\nIf you are on windows 10, I would also love your response to be able to hone if this is a windows 11 specific issue or an issue with something larger, so I would love your response as well\n\nAs of now those on linux are more than welcome to converse but if you don't have a windows machine then I'm not looking for a response from you at this time, but your insight would be excellent in the comments of this thread.\n\nIf you are not using SteamVR please also at this time do not respond. This is specifically investigating issues related to SteamVR and the recent windows update.\n\nIf you are seeing this I've made a google form to collect data on everything from PC specs and settings. This is a very detailed form and I'm more than happy to help find any sort of information needed. That form is found at both the top of this post and here: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSd7mCS1XqMKWrGEGRIV7UWjRCJB7zw0UDj5Xio4Mlr2WDb6Jw\/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSd7mCS1XqMKWrGEGRIV7UWjRCJB7zw0UDj5Xio4Mlr2WDb6Jw\/viewform?usp=sf_link) . This doesn't require a sign in so please to try and keep data clean don't comment more than once. Those 18 and under, or whatever the age of maturity is in your locality, should not use this form without a parent or guardians permission.\n\nIf after submitting your above your countries age of maturity and would like to help with testing after I get responses and start to see patterns Ill post in comments things I would like further investigation on in the comments.\n\nAs per the scientist in me this is the type of disclosure statement I was taught to write up: All attempts have been made in the making of this survey as anonymously as possible including the inability to take any sort of emails or contacts from the form itself. This research will also be preformed in public with a release of information found publicly at the end of this survey. No private messages will be sent either from me and should not be sent to me. In the event you need to make a concern known please make it known in the comments of this post. If you believe the survey could be improved in any way please also make that known in the comments of this post. Individuals are more that welcome to cross post this to communities they deem may be helpful, however users should be directed towards putting their comments in the original post on r\/SteamVR. In the event you believe either a breach or privacy or other issues have occurred please let me know as soon as you believe so the matter can be addressed publicly. The survey will run for at this point an undetermined amount of time until as such clear patterns and trends can emerge for further investigation. At this time the research will be posted in English and an interpreter is not available to participants. Any attempt to post inappropriate or off topic responses to either this post or the google form, the mods or other appropriate bodies will be notified. The author of this survey declares no competing interests.\n\nThe results are located here if anyone sees a trend I don't please let me know [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WTCfSQ3mXHvWwstk\\_0YLRX3-OXmqaDk3Epmk2xr8tXA\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WTCfSQ3mXHvWwstk_0YLRX3-OXmqaDk3Epmk2xr8tXA\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":92663,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Windows 11\/10 VR Intermittent\/Constant Stuttering or Issue Investigation Survey","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tscnvo\/windows_1110_vr_intermittentconstant_stuttering\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"VanaheimRanger","author_created_utc":1575510016,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_55po8vf7","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1647901157,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"tjnn0r","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"0ed9a6ce-1b99-11ec-bdc6-8afcaa441d3b","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_tjnn0r","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tjnn0r\/about_resolution_scaling_and_performance\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654053768,"retrieved_utc":1654053768,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Let me preface this by stating my system specs are pretty bad for VR:\n\nCPU: i7-4790K 4GHz\n\nGPU: Nvidia GTX 980 4GB VRAM\n\nRAM: 16GB DDR4 \n\nI originally got my Rift S so I could play classic Doom custom maps in VR using the GZDoomVR source port.  For the most part it has been great, but there are some more detailed modern maps made for it where the performance tanked hard when attempting to run them.  I'm talking about dropping down to 2 FPS and reprojecting like crazy.\n\nAfter playing a few games using VRPERFKIT and getting some much better performance, at the expense of some graphical fidelity, I wondered if SteamVR's built-in resolution scaling might help with Doom (GZDoomVR can only render in OpenGL or Vulkan modes, so VRPERKIT won't work for it) the textures and sprites in Doom were designed for 320x200 resolutions, so in theory, I could turn the scaling WAY down and not lose much visually.  So I tried it.\n\nAnd the results have been pretty great so far, I have tested on Counterattack, Bastion of Chaos, and Coma Moonlight, 3 WADs I was unable to run previously due to major performance issues.  At 50% resolution scaling, the visuals look identical to 100% (except for the text in the menus, but I can enlarge the menus to alleviate that) and the performance is VERY playable with only a few slight stutters here and there so far.\n\nMy main question though, as someone who doesn't really understand what impacts performance in PC\/VR gaming, am I correct in assuming that, running a game in VR is basically running it twice, so, running it at 50% resolution, is basically running it twice with each using half the resources, and therefore is basically the same as running the game once at normal resolution?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":92671,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"About resolution scaling and performance.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tjnn0r\/about_resolution_scaling_and_performance\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"MrDonaldHouse","author_created_utc":1596909381,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7m9ezata","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1647464946,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":1647566250.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"tft8ar","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_tft8ar","no_follow":false,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tft8ar\/need_help_with_streaming_vr_games_to_discord\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654062709,"retrieved_utc":1654062709,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey there. Don't really know if this is the right place for it, but I need help. Searched this issue up on the internet and came back with almost nothing relevant.\n\nContext: My boyfriend will occasionally stream VR games to Discord for me to watch and him to play - standard stuff. Pavlov, stuff like that.The issue is as follows: I can see only the left half of his screen. Today it felt like it was the very back corner and zoomed in so far as to make it unwatchable. Every search I did just pointed to some arbitrary setting in Steam VR, turn off the overlay, etc.There's no issue with that, just the actual sharing of the game screen. I'd like to be able to see the entire thing, you know? Not just one half. It's disorienting, a bad time. Would changing the setting to be mirrored or right eye or something help this whatsoever?He streamed it the way one would normally detect a game through Discord - not sure if this has any impact. Ex: wanted to play Half-Life Alyx, and clicked on \"Stream: Half-Life: Alyx\". This is all I know.\n\nThank you.\n\nEDIT: We fixed the issue (mostly). Streaming through OBS we changed the view to the right eye (which means I can actually see most of the game now, if still a little dizzying) and were able to get sound through some witchcraft. We figure that part of the issue is the field of view on his headset is higher compared to others (200 degrees (!!) vs 90) and creates some jank because of that.\n\nStill, thank you! Really unable to find solutions to this just searching the web generally, so I hope this can also help others if they have said issue.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":92672,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Need help with streaming VR games to Discord.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tft8ar\/need_help_with_streaming_vr_games_to_discord\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Mrbeeznz","author_created_utc":1544898154,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_2sj6qwqe","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1646006036,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"t31elu","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"c441a616-1b98-11ec-bb0b-c65b6a53b653","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_t31elu","no_follow":true,"num_comments":7,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/t31elu\/i_need_help_deciding_on_a_headset_for_when_my_og\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654092229,"retrieved_utc":1654092229,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"For context, I currently run an og quest from late 2019, early 2020 (on steam vr using Virtual Desktop) and im starting to consider options for when it inevitably retires (I'd like to keep it as a working relic) that will be a nice upgrade.\n\nI've looked online already for reviews but I would like words from people not from 2018.\n\nAn important thing to note is i live in New Zealand where options are severely limited and expensive.\n\nSo basically i have 3 real options im considering:\n\nValve index (complete vr kit) at NZ$2200\n\nVive pro eye complete kit (I love my social vr games and eye tracking would be pretty neat) NZ$2760\n\nOculus quest 2 (pretty sick of Facebook though) NZ$570\n\n(Other options also accepted, those are just my top 3 atm)\n\nBasically I'm stuck and need just a push in the right direction with advice or personal experience of the headsets to help me make a decision on what will likely replace my og quest\n\n\nThings to know:\n\nI will use this headset primarily for social games like vr chat, and occasionally other vr games like flight simulator\n\nMy pc specs are as follows:\n\nCpu -

I work in VR all day and do this 5 days a week then game some if I wanted to.\n\nI'm using OVR Toolkit, I capture 2 monitors &amp; windows. I am working from home taking calls from customers.\n\n\u2022 Left VR monitor is my main monitor. I have my Teamviewer into the office on this screen.\n\n\u2022 Right VR monitor is my secondary monitor. I have my Teamviewer 2nd office monitor or YouTube on this screen.\n\n\u2022 Above these 2 VR monitors is a window capturing my CCTV live feed - I can see who's coming to the door.\n\n\u2022 I have a window below, so when I look slightly downwards, my front-facing passthrough cameras fade into view and I can see my desk\/keyboard\/drink.\n\n\u2022 Finally I have a webcam capture behind me. So when I turn around to look at the door to my spare room\/mancave, I can see where my dogs are or if my wife wants to get my attention for a second, I can look at her lol.\n\nI couldn't do this with anything less than 5K as it will be too blurry and give a headache trying to read text all day.\n\nI take calls from customers, using the built-in mic and headphones, then using SIP software it defaults to the Vive Pro 2 for audio\/mic. They are oblivious that I'm actually working in VR.\n\nI think the most time I spent in VR was about 10 or 12 hours in 1 sitting. Going out for lunch to walk the dogs.\n\nYou have to be good at touch typing as you can't see your hands\/placement on the keyboard. I can do it, but I call it blind-typing as your cut-off from anything in your peripherals. This is where just the other day I thought about using the pass-through cameras to help find my drink on the desk lol.\n\nAs for comfort, it is a well-balanced HMD, but to help I replaced the foam face pads with Kiwi face pads and then a cotton face cover, it makes it feel very soft on the face.\n\nOh and the final touch, I have theBlu VR experience running behind, where the fish and turtles, rays swim all around me, it's very chill.\n\nImage of all my screens in VR and computer desktops = [https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912432763460804708\/unknown.png](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912432763460804708\/unknown.png)\n\ntheBlu (my background in VR) = [https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912452628435304528\/unknown.png](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912452628435304528\/unknown.png)\n\nI have an android phone, using SideSync app on the PC and mobile, I can control\/swipe my phone and even take calls.

I've got a pc with a 10700k and 3060ti.  Right out of the gate, I feel like the two choices are HP G2 or Index.  I've done quite a bit of reading and youtubing on the subject and it seems to come down to a single choice: better clarity via higher resolution or larger FOV with faster frames - ugh!  This is such a subjective question, so I'm going to lay out a little framework which might help you all advise me.\n\nHaving used the Quest 2 both on its own and connected to my PC, I have to say it's underwhelming.  To put it otherwise, if that were the best offering in the VR space right now, I'd just not get into VR.  The clarity isn't even remotely what I would consider good.  I've tried the lens adjustment in all IPD positions and this thing just doesn't look right unless you're looking dead-on.  White text on a black background glows, it's just not a good look.\n\nThe allure of the G2 is the clarity of the picture, but to that end, when I used the Q2, I recall really wishing I had a larger FOV.\n\nI'd really like to keep spending at $1k or less on this.  My hunch is and has been to just get the G2 but every time I think I'm sold, I see folks raving about the FOV of the index.\n\nThe first game I'll be getting is Half Life Alyx.

Never had to change power management settings or anything, the Valve Index just worked perfectly. So I believe the headset is fine.\n\nRecently I upgraded to a 2021 Razer Blade and turns out it didn't have a mini displayport. It supports DisplayPort over USB-C Alt-Mode. So I got [this](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B07ZT12Q41) adapter and applied the [firmware update that made the USB devices use the dGPU](https:\/\/mysupport.razer.com\/app\/answers\/detail\/a_id\/4015\/).\n\n# Issue Description\nWhile playing a game, the headset will suddenly just crash. The screen will be blank and I will lose sound. The microphone input still seems to be working from what friends have told me. This happens to me often in Phasmophobia (I play it a lot) and has happened in Myst and Red Matter.\n\nResetting the headset has been problematic. Whatever is happening is causing something in the driver space to lock up windows. I can't shutdown without holding the power to forcefully power cycle the laptop.\n\n# Troubleshooting Done\nSome screenshots [here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/lflWOxv) that include the SteamVR performance graph with notes.\n\nSo far I've tried switching between different refresh rates. Previously switching to 80hz didn't matter either and in the screenshots I shared, you'll see I've tried 90hz and 120hz.\n\nIn the device manager I've disabled power management for the USB controllers and Thunderbolt controllers.

prevents casting to the headset, delete it and replace it with *-vrmode openvr* with the * on both sides like this * -vrmode openvr * just without the spaces between the star and the text, after doing

everything runs normal on the monitor, but inside the headset all I see is \"Next Up\" and then after a bit It'll say \"Waiting...\" and I can hear the game audio out of the headset, if you look at the monitor though it shows the game playing in VR, all the tracking is working and I can start a game but it never goes to the headset, specs are \n\nHeadset:Oculus Quest 2\nGPU:GTX 1060\nCPU:Ryzen 3600\nRAM: 32GB 3200\n\nWe've tried it with AirLink and an official Oculus link cable, I was able to make it work once with virtual desktop streamer but ever since that solution has stopped working, it just takes me right back to the \"Waiting...\" screen, I've uninstalled\/reinstalled SteamVR, the Oculus software, and updated drivers, but no luck, I'm hoping someone has had a similar issue and found a work around, it works on my PC just fine, the only difference between them is the GPU, I have an RTX 2070, if the GPU is the problem it can be replaced but we were hoping to wait long enough

in the future, but in the mean time, i just want to play it normally. before all of this happened, i could run the game at max settings in 4k and get a stable 60fps, now it sits around 38fps on the

talking from the assumption that you bought the game on steam and it's a native steam game. i can't find any settings in steam vr while it's running to disable it from launching with elite dangerous, i can't find anything on the epic store to stop it from launching steam vr. the only thing i see is an option to launch the game in vr, but there isn't anything to stop it from launching in vr. i've tried adding the elite dangerous launchter to steam as a non steam game but when i launch that from steam, the elite dangerous launcher tells me to login with my frontier account, and it gives me a verification code that i enter from the email it sends, and then it tells me to buy the game. i've also linked my steam account to my frontier account and i still get the same thing. i added elitedangerous64 which is the actual game to steam and it tells me to login from the launcher. i've tried checking and unchecking \"include game in steam vr library\" in the game options in steam and the starting the launcher from the epic store and that didn't change anything either, it still launches with steam vr, and there is nothing in the steam vr options, which i access while the game is running, which would solve the problem fwom what i can see. i've also already changed the display in the game settings to the flat screen i usually use, i've turned 3d off, i've set it to full screen. everything is normal except that my FPS is cut in half because stupid steam vr is rendering everything twice. i don't know what to do and i don't accept that uninstalling steam vr is the solution

everyone,  \nI've been having an issue recently when playing VRChat that has been really interfering with my experience with VR. I never had this issue with Beat Saber so I'm not sure if the issue resides in my computer, link cable, or a spec on my PC. It usually occurs in the middle of a play session and constantly comes back up somehow.   \n\n\nI've only had my quest for two weeks or so and I play with a link cable connected to my PC. For context I have a Ryzen 5, Rtx 2060, and 16 GBS of memory, however, I would get horrible lag spikes that creep up on me. Normally it would start off as little stutters to full on episodes and get worse over time. Eventually, the lag would get so bad that I can't play anymore and I've tried everything from restarting my quest to clearing my cache in game but all are temporary fixes and it would come back at some point.  \n\n\nThis started a few days ago and I noticed that usually when I lag the graph in SteamVR is all red. sometimes exceeding 100+ ms and my graphics card maxing at 100%.

([https:\/\/www.beta.ctrlv.cz\/0WC0](https:\/\/www.beta.ctrlv.cz\/0WC0))However, it is ten times worse in the headset, than in the picture.\n\nSo I did some troubleshooting.\n\nWhen I use my Vive on cable, the game runs smoothly in at least 90 FPS and there is no problem, but when I use the wireless adapter, it is locked to 60 FPS. I played a lot in wireless before and it ran smoothly. I already encountered this problem once, but then I somehow solved it\/it went away, but I can't remember what I did. I doubt that there is a problem with my PC performance, because looking at the performance graph, nothing runs even close to 80% usage.\n\nHere is a screenshot of both graphs. [https:\/\/www.beta.ctrlv.cz\/U54A](https:\/\/www.beta.ctrlv.cz\/U54A)\n\nToday I discovered that the 60 FPS lock isn't only in Beat Saber, it is also in Pavlov VR and probably other games.

This FPS lock appeared out of nowhere. The only things I update regularly are NVIDIA drivers and Windows updates, so that may be the problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT 2:** The problem was caused by high frame timing, probably caused by the FPS lock.
