I am willing to look at higher price ranges for graphics cards but want to know if what I have will provide a good experience.\n&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/list\/vm4XMV\"&gt;PCPartPicker Part List&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Type&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Item&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Price&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/yXmmP6\/amd-ryzen-5-7600-38-ghz-6-core-processor-100-100001015box\"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 7600 3.8 GHz 6-Core Processor&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$229.00 @ Newegg&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU Cooler&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/MzMMnQ\/thermalright-phantom-spirit-120-se-argb-6617-cfm-cpu-cooler-ps120se-argb\"&gt;Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 SE ARGB 66.17 CFM CPU Cooler&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$35.90 @ Amazon&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motherboard&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/qcbRsY\/asrock-b650m-pro-rs-wifi-micro-atx-am5-motherboard-b650m-pro-rs-wifi\"&gt;ASRock B650M Pro RS WiFi Micro ATX AM5 Motherboard&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$139.99 @ Newegg&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/cCKscf\/silicon-power-value-gaming-32-gb-2-x-16-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-sp032gxlwu60afdeae\"&gt;Silicon Power Value Gaming 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL30 Memory&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$93.97 @ Amazon&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/crKKHx\/western-digital-black-sn850x-2-tb-m2-2280-pcie-40-x4-nvme-solid-state-drive-wds200t2x0e\"&gt;Western Digital Black SN850X 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME Solid State Drive&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$119.99 @ Amazon&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Card&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/XPjNnQ\/asrock-radeon-rx-6800-xt-16-gb-phantom-gaming-d-oc-video-card-rx6800xt-pgd-16go\"&gt;ASRock Phantom Gaming D OC Radeon RX 6800 XT 16 GB Video Card&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$449.99 @ Newegg&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/M7Z9TW\/montech-air-100-argb-microatx-mid-tower-case-air-100-argb-black\"&gt;Montech AIR 100 ARGB MicroATX Mid Tower Case&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$59.99 @ Newegg&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Supply&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/product\/FKZXsY\/enermax-revolution-df-2-850-w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-ers850ewt\"&gt;Enermax REVOLUTION D.F. 2 850 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$89.99 @ Newegg&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Total (before mail-in rebates)&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;$1228.82&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Mail-in rebates&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;-$10.00&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1218.82&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Generated by &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\"&gt;PCPartPicker&lt;\/a&gt;

I did have lots of issues with it that I will detail in this post too.\n\nI bought the Humble Bundle for $18 that included a bunch of VR games, Vertigo Remastered being one of them. I will be starting Vertigo 2 tonight. I am completely blind, and didn't know about any moments. My reviews are normally pretty detailed and long, so feel free to only read categories that interest you, or skip to the conclusion for a TLDR.\n\n**Environment and Storytelling**\n\nI'll start with my favorite part of the game, and that's the *vibe.* The tone of the game is like *something is slightly off.* The premise is that you are trapped in a nuclear reactor, and are trying to get to the surface to escape. It's highly inspired by Portal, and I would say the vibe is actually slightly more crazy. I found myself looking around for little easter eggs to help myself understand the story\/lore of the world.\n\nThe story is fairly subtle. There are little logs left by scientists that are disconnected from one another. One might foreshadow a boss you are about to fight, another might explain why certain set pieces are there. That being said, subtle might be a bit too generous of a word to use. There isn't much of a story there. You are trapped, you are trying to get out, the aliens and robots are trying to stop you, etc. There are no moments that made me *feel* something. This would normally be a huge issue for me, but the other aspects of the game carried it for me.\n\n**Gameplay\/AI**\n\nThere are very few VR games that can keep me playing with gameplay alone. I am more of a story guy. I like walking simulators, like Firewatch or Gone Home. That being said, the gameplay here is much better than the average VR game. I really don't like the sword you start with. I noticed the few negative reviews on steam cited this as the reason for their refund. It's quite unfortunate because the gunplay in this game is truly excellent.\n\nI am personally not a fan of complex reloading mechanics, so the single button reload was welcome. My favorite guns came a bit late in the game, but I understand why that was. In particular the last gun you get is OP af. Think the last area of HLA where you become a telekinesis god briefly. I kinda want to replay having that gun the whole time, just for laughs.\n\nI played on normal difficulty and felt like the enemies were too much of a bullet sponge. I upgraded my gun and got the max gun achievement by the end, and still felt like the enemies should die a bit faster. Just my personal opinion. I had the same complaint about destiny bosses.\n\nThe upgrade path itself was fairly compelling. It gave me a reason to explore all the side hallways. I even had to jump and grab a latter to find a really well hidden one! I found myself satisfied when I found hidden ones, which is something I rarely do in games. For whatever reason, I didn't do that in HLA, but I loved doing it here.\n\nThe AI was actually surprisingly good. Certain mob types will rush you aggressively, others will find cover. I personally didn't find any exploitable bugs in their behavior, aside from the fact that I re-centered so that my height was accurate. I am like 5 foot 7, and when I touch the ground IRL it doesn't get anywhere close to the ground in game; therefore, I raised the headset above my head, re-centered, and got it accurate height. After that, I no longer had to duck in doors and could reach objects on the ground. I don't have this issue on my G2 in any other game. This made cover more effective against enemies as well.\n\n**Graphics**\n\nI am not a huge fan of the graphics. The enemies themselves looked pretty good, and the animations were fluid, but the actual level stuff was flat. Sometimes a wall would have a red light on it, and the wall almost looked like the default unity wall. I typically like it when things are decorated, or have some imperfections in the texture. Another problem in VR is that 2d textures meant to give 3d depth can sometimes look bad. I can immediately tell if a wall has an actual attached 3d object, or a 2d texture that is supposed to give the impression of a 3d object. This shows most at the beginning where there is a grass texture on the mountain instead of painted grass, but comes back in various parts of the game.\n\nI found this one to be inconsistent too. Like some levels have depth and details, and others are fairly flat. I particularly didn't like the trees in the outdoor level. I have seen those in many VR games, and little things like that can take me out of the game.\n\n**Level Design\/Mild Puzzles**\n\nThis one is a mixed bag for me. Some of the levels I absolutely loved, and some I hated. I will explain why below.\n\nThe best level in my opinion is the one with the water in the middle. You are running around pulling levers to extend a massive bridge and drain the water. What I liked about it, is that it felt like a real factory environment. The non-hostel NPCs were just zooming about going about their business. The best part about this level is how much *scale* it has. The sheer size of everything that happens is a sight to behold in my opinion. I also thought it was so freakin cool to watch the environment change as I did my thing. I can't put my finger on it, but it just made the world feel much more real. This level was so good it carried my investment in the game for the rest.\n\nThat leads me to my least favorite level, the spoopy tunnel. The level of puzzle of this one was too much. This one had me running around looking for worms to put into a door, which was funny, but it also had a motherboard collection puzzle. I got stuck here so frustratingly long that I had to find a non-commentary play to get past it. The solution was not satisfying for me, and didn't feel like \"ahh-hah! I am such an idiot I should have figured that out\". I thought \"OH that's BS\". I didn't feel like this level needed two simultaneous collection puzzles at the same time. I honestly didn't even realize you were supposed to put the board together until I looked up the no commentary walkthrough. Maybe I missed it, but I don't think the developer gave me any indicator that I needed to do that.\n\nI also felt like the final boss in this one was frustrating. I think I may have missed some sort of mechanic because it was by far the most difficult encounter in the game for me. I never died on it, but I got close several times. There is one moment right before the boss of this level that I really liked, but overall this is the only D or F tier level for me. Every other level was excellent.\n\nI don't typically like puzzles in VR games. I find most of the ones in both Lone Echo games to be frustrating obstacles to finding out the story and getting to see the set pieces. Most of the ones in Vertigo are on my level. They are easy enough for me to figure out, and so didn't detract from the game for me. No one ever had to give me a tutorial, I just always knew what to do. That's good puzzle design, but talented puzzle solvers will find no challenge here until the spoopy tunnel.\n\n**Music\/Sound**\n\nThis is easily the best part of the game for me. Go listen to the soundtrack right now. My favorite soundtrack for a movie is Tron Legacy. If you are a big fan of electronic music, and haven't played Vertigo, please listen to this: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fhKC0ezLnsk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fhKC0ezLnsk). I listened to it while typing this review, and will probably continue to listen to it for years. The soundtrack might actually be better than the game itself.\n\nThe sound design of the teleport gun in particular was awesome. I didn't find the regular gun sounds to be special, but the watery glass of the teleporter was just so satisfying to me.\n\n**Creativity**\n\nIf I could say one thing to this developer, it would be \"dude you are one creative motherfucker.\" I can tell each aspect of this game was made with a \"wouldn't it be so cool if...\" mentality, but the ideas are actually so creative. That's one thing I haven't heard people say in the hype for this game.\n\nThe passion and hard work really shows in this game. I have played pretty much every major VR release since CV1 launch, and rarely do I think the developer just *gets what I want.* I remember during one part of the game I was climbing a latter and it came to me:\n\nI have been feeling unsatisfied with native VR games compared to VR mods of 2d games and I couldn't figure out why. Because of Vertigo Remastered, I finally know what my VR game taste is. I was climbing a latter in this game when it hit me, *Vertigo* is actually what I want from a VR game. It has literally taken me this long to understand WTF I want from developers. If I could have Vertigo Remastered, but with more story, that's exactly what I want. I want crazy guns, *huge* open environments, and above all *surprises and creativity.* It's those individual *moments* that hit hardest in VR.\n\nIf I had 10 VR games of this quality, scale, and creativity sitting on my Steam Wishlist, I would be a happy man! I know this claim is huge, but I actually learned a lot about my own taste in VR games from Vertigo Remastered.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe VR press runs on hype. You guys know what I mean. When Zenith came out, some reviewers were acting like it was going to literally be the next World of Warcraft, and bring VR to the mainstream. I am not going to sit here and call out every game individually (and btw I actually love Zenith), but I am mainly talking about the culture of how VR games are hyped. For years I have listened to various podcasters recommend Vertigo then Vertigo Remastered, and now I know why. I actually think Vertigo Remastered completely lives up to the hype. I found it to be creative, fun, and just the right amount of difficulty. As far as native VR games go, it's definitely in my top 5 alongside Alyx, Lone Echo 1 and 2, and Invisible Hours (still my favorite). Considering the difference in budget and team, it's incredible the amount of value Vertigo Remastered delivers.\n\nI am curious if you guys agree or disagree with this review.

I've been working on a very simple \"hello, world\" overlay for OpenVR in C++ and for whatever reason the overlay refuses to appear within VR. Now, I initially assumed I was just not programming it right so I began to search the internet for the very few examples that exist. The first was from this reddit page several years ago ([https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/dtmfbt\/openvr\\_overlay\\_sample\\_application\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/dtmfbt\/openvr_overlay_sample_application\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) and the second was an example written in C using the openvr\\_capi.h instead of the standard header ([https:\/\/gist.github.com\/cnlohr\/6e452dc6cc2df7f48d5ade66059358d9](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/cnlohr\/6e452dc6cc2df7f48d5ade66059358d9)). That developer used the same \"rawdraw\\_sf.h\" header as me throughout the program. With the first example my only change to the code was the file location, and I didn't change the second example at all. And yet, neither showed up in VR. Notably, all three programs (my own, the reddit example, and the github example) would open steam VR on launch, and both my program and the github example react in the terminal to a remote turning on. So now my best guess is that, for whatever reason, OpenVR overlays are not appearing in SteamVR games. For reference, I am on a windows mixed reality headset.

[the Steam Community](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/games\/250820\/announcements\/detail\/3694680573634046691):\n\n&gt;If you encounter issues with this update, please post in the [SteamVR Bug Report](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/250820\/discussions\/3\/) forum. If possible, please include a system report to aid in tracking down your issue.\n\n***\n\n&gt;In this update we're building off our existing controller compatibility features to make more games instantly accessible to more controllers with automatic rebinding. In version 1.24 we introduced Compatibility Mode, which allows players to set up a binding that lets a controller mimic one that the game is expecting. Now, when a game is missing a binding for your controller, SteamVR will automatically create a new binding, configure it based on a more common controller, and set it to simulate that controller type. Controller driver developers can specify a list of different controllers they want to be able to use bindings from as well as directions on how to remap from one controller to another. For example, if a game has only set up bindings for Oculus Touch controllers but you're using Windows Mixed Reality controllers, SteamVR will remap actions using the trigger-style grip of the Oculus Touch to the button style grip of the WMR controller. If a developer does decide to create a native binding for your controller, SteamVR will switch to that as soon as its available. This feature will work for all titles using OpenXR and SteamVR Input.\n\n&gt;To kickstart this endeavor we've created a number of default remappings for popular controller types. Driver developers can override these as they see fit. New controllers can also use this feature to get instant compatibility with the majority of the SteamVR catalog with no additional game developer work needed.\n\n&gt;While native support and explicit bindings will always be superior, having this compatibility layer will smooth releases and lighten the load on game developers and controller manufacturers alike. Controller driver developers can get more information on creating a rebinding file at this documentation page.\n\n### SteamVR:\n* A handle has been added to the dashboard, allowing it to be positioned in space. The position is reset whenever it is summoned.\n* Added automatic rebinding for controllers without native bindings. For SteamVR Input and OpenXR games we will attempt to rebind to a supported controller type.\n\n### OpenXR:\n* The dedicated OpenXR settings tab has been re-enabled. The buttons in this tab currently bring up the UAC prompt, which cannot be clicked in VR. This tab has the ability to manually enable and disable implicit OpenXR api layers on Windows.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":true,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":103167,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"SteamVR

I launch SteamVR via AirLink, works fine. I launch Blade and Sorcery via SteamVR interface and Steam on PC in SteamVR mode. It works on PC, but doesn't show up in the headset, just a menu that says 'Blade and Sorcery', 'Next Up'. It works fine via Oculus without SteamVR, but I wouldn't be typing this if I wanted to use Oculus. Next, I try Virtual Desktop. SteamVR launches, games still don't work. I've tried using OVR Advanced Settings and Launch Parameters with no luck. I've also completely verified and reinstalled SteamVR. I thought maybe it's quite high end and just isn't loading, so I tried ROBLOX in VR. It launched on the PC, detected my head movements and controller movements (no input) on the PC, but it didn't show up in the headset. So, I assume this is a SteamVR issue as it works fine on Oculus. Any fix? Thanks. (PS:  Gorilla Tag on SteamVR works fine aswell, even in the headset, and yes, the runtime is set to SteamVR. It seems like it's only certain games that don't work.)\n\nLOW END PC BTW:\n\nGTX 1060 3GB\n\ni7 2600\n\nI do not want comments telling me to 'upgrade my PC' as it worked fine before, with low-ish FPS on Blade and Sorcery, but I am not here to be told to upgrade my PC, because quite frankly, that is not the issue.

Particles are distorted spherical meshes for the VR experience.\n\n\\- No textures.\n\n\\- The particle shader is temporary.\n\n\\- The explosion core has been given a bloom effect (PC). If we port it to Quest in the future it will be solved with shaders like we did in Zephyrus Prelude (Post process kill any VR Android GPU).\n\nIn the next version, the smoke will live longer and cast and receive shadows (will be optional).\n\nThe type of explosion will depend on the type of target being detonated. So there will be several types of explosions.\n\nEnemy Drones are in progress, I'll show you some next time ;)\n\nand **don't forget: demolition coming soon!**\n\nIf you are interested in the background of the development, you can **check our discord channel**.

Click \"I want to pair another controller\" and repeat for the other controller. Have to click \"Try Again\" once\n\n* Plug in the three dongles.

Click SteamVR, click Room Setup, put my headset and one controller on the ground, point my other controller at the monitor and squeeze the trigger, put the controller on the ground to calibrate the floor, pick it up again, joystick over to \"room-scale\", pick up the physical mouse so I can click \"Advanced Mode\", put the mouse back down, walk around my playspace with the controller and squeeze the trigger, return to the monitor to verify, finish room setup\n\n* Put on the headset\n\n* Finally able to launch a game. Realize one friend I was trying to join is offline now\n\nI hate Facebook\/Meta, but it's starting to feel like SteamVR is abandonware. Every time I use PCVR (especially the agony of trying to use Index controllers in mixed reality) I have to deal with problems that would be non-issues if the software was just updated.

One of the options per profile is \"which app do you want this input to go to.\"  So the fix is:  (a) start the game (b) edit the Options for the VA profile for that game, so that the input goes to the game process (which will appear in the menu of processes because it's running).  Save the edited profile and enjoy VoiceAttack commands in Steam game.\n\nI never knew that feature existed because -- like most ppl -- the app worked and I loaded it up with commands and just used it, rather then spending a day or two exploring every menu option.  And I got away with that for about 2 years, 18 months maybe... until SteamVR got grabby and started seizing focus whenever you switch to VR or dismiss a virterm.\n\n\\-------------------- original plaintive post ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor years of happy VR play in games with lots of user commands (like ETS2\/ATS, Skyrim) I have traditionally used voice commands, using VoiceAttack which is imho a darned good speech recognition app.  VA maps spoken words and phrases to arbitrarily long \"scripts\" of keyboard input, from single keystrokes to extended command sequences.  Easy to configure and works like a charm.\n\nUntil now.\n\nVA has worked great ever since I started using it about 18 months ago.  Worked great in ATS, ETS2, Skyrim.  I got out of VR for a few months (probably several Steam upgrades and who knows how many win11 patches) then dropped back in -- decided to upgrade my flatscreen XP10 to XPLANE11VR -- and while doing this I discovered that I can no longer get kbrd input to the game when in VR.\n\nAt first I thought this was some XPLANE weirdness, like it was voluntarily ceding focus.  But no.\n\nWas just today doing a reconfigure and reboot of SkyrimVR... and found the same problem.  I played Skyrim intensively for over a year using VoiceAttack to invoke kbrd commands but now, the same problem as with XPLANE:  I can give the game focus by popping up a virch term and clicking on it (then voice commands work perfectly), but as soon as I dismiss the virch term, SteamVR grabs focus back -- and no kbrd commands go to the game any more.\n\nI used to simply click on the game window, then exit the virch term and focus would stay with the game.\n\nIn XP11 my workaround is to leave the terminal up, but move it above and behind me so I never see it in the ordinary course of gameplay.  This is a seated (plane cockpit) game so this ugly hack works OK for the moment and preserves my voice commands.\n\nSkyrim however is an action\/openworld roaming game with full freedom of motion -- so I absolutely cannot leave a virtual terminal just floating around in the game world.\n\nHas anyone else noticed this annoying new \"feature\" of SteamVR and is there any way, \\*please\\*, to overcome it?  After discovering the beauty of voice commands I really hate to go back to fumbling through floating menus, invoking console and typing on lame virtual keyboards, etc.  So antimersive.\n\nPS should perhaps mention that in XPLANE, input from USB game controllers (HOTAS and pedals) works just fine.

I've used it for about two years, and I'm just about done with it. I'm running my VR on an ROG Zephyrus G14 (24GB of ram, 5900HS with an RTX3060). This laptop should be more than enough to do VR, let alone something as light as Beat Saber, H3VR and so on. It runs Forza Horizion 5 on mid-raytrace with high settings without much trouble, and I've used it for other tasks like rendering and CAD.  \n\n\nI've tried both Virtual Desktop and both types of Link (air and cable), and I'm always getting lag when there shouldn't be lag. So I'm considering just selling the headset and buying a new VR headset.  \n\n\nDo any of you guys know what is the best headset for VR? I'm not looking for something like the quest where I have to have software in between my headset and SteamVR playing the middle man. I don't care about price, I just want something that will run the best for it's price and my set up.  \n\n\nIf however Quest 2 turns out to be the best, what are some ways I can improve preformance? I've done everything from fixing the power settings, to turning off\/on ASW on both steamvr and oculus, to reducing the resolution, to changing the bandwidth of the cable on Quest 2. Is there anything else that I can do or is there some sort of software or option to turn on to somehow give me more \npreformance?\n\nUPDATE: Talked with support and they told me to delete OCulus software on the PC, but also to delete every trace of Oculus in the AppData folder.

\n\nHello, I'm a relatively new Quest 2 owner (I had the Rift S before), and I am having a lot of fun with it. I love the official Oculus games I've downloaded and have had zero trouble running or playing any of them whatsoever.\n\nHowever, a big reason I REALLY wanted a new VR headset was to play SteamVR games. VRchat, No Man's Sky, Green Hell, those types.\n\nYesterday I played both VRchat and Google Earth VR and it blacked my PC monitors\/shut off my GPU and the case fans in my PC went into hyperdrive. The weird thing is nothing was physically hot. No heat coming off or out of the PC or anything.\n\nI tinkered with some Windows settings (changed VR Dashboard power mode to \"High Performance\", changed Windows power settings to the 'secret' \"Ultimate Performance\" mode), turned off Nvidia GeForce Experience (the in-game overlay app), disabled Windows Game Mode and played VRchat for 3 hours today with no problem.\n\nThen, I booted it up again and it crashed in 5 minutes. I then changed Steam AND SteamVR to \"Run as Administrator.\" Loaded up VRchat again, black screened again in 5 minutes. GPU shuts off, fans howling. I'm stumped.\n\n**This is my rig and how I'm running the SteamVR games:**  \n\\-Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti 11GB  \n\\-Intel Core i9-9900K Processor (8x 3.60GHz)  \n\\-Liquid Cooled (Enermax)  \n\\-32GB RAM (DDR4 3200MHz)  \n\\-ASUS PRIME Z390-P -- 802.11ac WiFi  \n\\-PSU: 850 Watt - CORSAIR RM850X Black - 80 PLUS Gold, Full Modular\n\n**Quest 2:**  \n\\-Using Air Link  \n\\-PC is direct connected to modem via ethernet cable  \n\\-Connected to 5G Wi-Fi (router right beside PC, never more than 4 feet away from headset)  \n\\-200-300 Mbps Cable internet\n\nThis is very frustrating, as I feel like I have a more than capable PC to run VR games, yet it still crashes when I play games that aren't native to the app. Any suggestions? I really want to enjoy VRchat like everyone else, and I'm also afraid I may not be able to run any other SteamVR games either, which would be a major bummer. Any help is appreciated.

I understand these are not AAA quality games and as they are demos there be bugs and missing features, so they are rated depending on the potential on the idea (and bonus points for originality), how much effort is put into its graphics and gameplay and the content and easy access of the demo's features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games will be tested with a Valve Index and RTX 3080 GPU.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm very disappointed how many demos are unplayable this time, from broken controls to until to get even started.  If I had to guess, many of these would be made to work for the Quest 2, so the Index controls would not be as responsive, but this didn't affect nearly as much experiences as it did in the past compared to this time around.  There are a few more games needed to be added to the list (more keep being added as well) but they are currently downloading as the list was the biggest this time around, but sadly most disappointing (no 4.5+ or higher this time around).  Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.  This does not work correctly for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down Fast VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1956860\/Down_Fast_VR\/\n\nThis bicycle game keeps drifting me to the left-side, no button seems to work (and it's not my controllers).  I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.  I am unable to get started in this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRANDMA**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1727550\/GRANDMA\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?).  Not sure If I wanted to play this one anyway from that cover\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hyperstacks**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1046760\/Hyperstacks\/\n\nI can't get the dash to work with the Index Controllers (little mini-jumps) and can't complete the tutorial.  It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":94016,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/vc9x2v\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"IHateNumbers1230","author_created_utc":1551577470,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3c1lx8po","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1654717589,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":1654718948.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"v7y7ko","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_metadata":{"p6gp4kx8ag491":{"e":"Image","id":"p6gp4kx8ag491","m":"image\/png","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p6gp4kx8ag491.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df5db67e9356eb7a94ac97467a55a528b8606eff","x":108,"y":92},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p6gp4kx8ag491.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ceb4d845e4ef022c1225bdb55ab2831144c8d162","x":216,"y":185},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p6gp4kx8ag491.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=366146d9e2c5e875b24528b92f640d9afde2ea13","x":320,"y":274}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p6gp4kx8ag491.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b0b6c7d2f22d3f579457835b634ba1402135069","x":362,"y":311},"status":"valid"},"zpu23sjjcg491":{"e":"Image","id":"zpu23sjjcg491","m":"image\/png","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zpu23sjjcg491.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e37fcbaa3c534c9f248df1a722317f546456eaf","x":108,"y":104},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zpu23sjjcg491.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f062085de07c0a027bce8980af4bad9f67cb94d","x":216,"y":209},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zpu23sjjcg491.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50e04b9383f9563c3f39771646265a4ef1db4486","x":320,"y":309}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zpu23sjjcg491.png?width=347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=84b5755830cf61818f9f5c219646fd0613131670","x":347,"y":336},"status":"valid"}},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_v7y7ko","no_follow":false,"num_comments":16,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/v7y7ko\/strange_sudden_lag\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657152192,"retrieved_utc":1657152192,"score":6,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"My PC was running fine until a couple days ago.

those who saw the last post the TLDR is there's a new issue and if your seeing it like here [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/ugan6u\/the\\_issue\\_returns\\_volenteers\\_and\\_responces\\_needed\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/ugan6u\/the_issue_returns_volenteers_and_responces_needed\/) I need what game and what OS your seeing it in.\n\nHi All. Hope you've been well. Since I've started this investigation I've learned a lot about how steamVR works and how the current issues plaguing the platform as discovered and how they are activated. The biggest issue I made the original post about all the way back in april was resolved by steamvr thanks to the discovery and fixing of a multimedia timer resolution issue. Once that was fixed I thought all I would be left with is basically making the equivalent of a giant list of troubleshooting steps that help in steamVR before assuming extreme measures such as a reinstall or even new hardware was needed. But then during a normal non investigative VR session playing on version 1.22.9, I suddenly was greeted by a familiar sight the pink lines of death! I thought first was it the same thing so I reinstalled FPSVR to try their fix, but to now luck. After extensive investigations I've been doing over the past week day in and out I've found a new issue with steamVR I have dated all the way back to so far 1.22.5 causing an irrecoverable state leading to frame losses and stuttering perceived by the end user. This is detailed in the report which I will talk about shortly.\n\nFirst I want to address one thing I've been wrong about and up until recently brushed off. Nvidia famously had a driver level bug causing intermittent stuttering. After this was no longer officially listed by nvidia as a bug, Specifically bug number  3152190, I thought this bug was over because for me at least I didn't see it anymore.  I can confirm sometime between the switchover from the standard to the Newer DCH drivers this bug has been reintroduced. We don't see frame drops in my testing in drivers 471.11 and 471.41, but starting around driver 511.23 this appears to have been reintroduced. As part of this investigation I'm in the early stages of looking into this and making another official bug report with nvidia providing my findings. I hope to potentially get this addressed by nvidia in either a driver update addressing the issue or determining if there's some other stupid reason it seems broken.\n\nSecondly I want to thank the countless people who I have talked with on the various subreddits for providing me information to make better bug reports to both steam and nvidia in the coming days. Once I've gotten those reports in officially Ill be sure to notify y'all. I also want to thank the countless responses to the survey, your responses helped me narrow my investigation to specific windows settings that actually do cause issues and yielded the 3 most important things I've found so far, Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling Should Be Disabled, RAM should be set to JDEC Specs, and that the steamVR beta 1.22.5 fixed some of the issues massively. I also Found that multiple monitors do cause issues and should be taken down to one monitor as a troubleshooting step.\n\nThird I want to address the statement I made last time as I have some better information. I talked about that AMD systems seem to have more issues than Intel. After looking into it further I think this comes down to 3 things. First the windows 11 chipset driver issues caused a lot of headaches, and those on windows 11 need to get their chipset drivers and OS up to date manually. Secondly USB dropout seems to have been hit and miss weather its been fixed. Update your BIOS and see if its been fixed to a version of agesa at least [1.2.0.3](https:\/\/1.2.0.3) if possible. Finally fTPM stuttering may be a larger factor than originally thought before. I should in theory (X570s hopefully MSI hasn't already dropped support) be getting an update for this on my board here soon so Ill definitely be playing around with that! I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with AMD systems its just there's a lot more hardware combos than on intel systems so that'll of course introduce more headache.\n\nFourth Pls don't oc your stuff. that's all I have to say\n\nFifth ReBar Most likely doesn't cause issue sin my follow-up testing and the HDR stuff is confusing me to say the least. Also I don't have an above 100hz polling rate mouse but some do find issues on 2d games with those so by that logic it stems that yea we could see issues with those in VR.\n\nSixth the part a lot of people been waiting for: The draft reports here [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1jjo930DG--oxPIw3EqJH01FzyuKJFmkYEQU7lCJc3eQ\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1jjo930DG--oxPIw3EqJH01FzyuKJFmkYEQU7lCJc3eQ\/edit?usp=sharing) , its very early and has been written over many late nights totaling right now a staggering 31 pages which will probably increase as I investigate the current issue and the Nvidia stutter issue. Enjoy the current results and findings and hopefully over the coming months itll be more polished.\n\nSEVENTH AND FINALLY ADRESSING 1.22.9 and this post: [**https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/ugan6u\/the\\_issue\\_returns\\_volenteers\\_and\\_responces\\_needed\/**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/ugan6u\/the_issue_returns_volenteers_and_responces_needed\/) **.** I didn't receive the greatest response to this having a terrible upvote rate which in retrospective the title was kinda cringe and bad for something trying to convey a lot of information. Ill be pointing towards that post as the reference of what I'm seeing. Basically between versions 1.22.5 and the current beta there's an issue which can cause constant dropped frames but a different constant dropped frames than we were seeing earlier. I'm also in the middle of this investigation as I type this I'm installing windows 10 onto a ssd right now to try and see if its also on windows 10 including 11. I've included pictures of what I'm seeing. I've also taken multiple HWINFO reading in hopes of finding something. RN my best solution is to update to the latest beta and ill check every beta version and the second I cant get one to have this issue happen Ill let everyone know.

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa\\_dont\\_upgrade\\_to\\_windows\\_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa_dont_upgrade_to_windows_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3)\n\nIf you need help finding answers to these questions CPU-Z GPU-Z and HWInfo64 are great programs, the more data the better!\n\nDay 4: Still working on the statistics part. The main goal is to finally finalize that today letting me then see which user reports are worth investigating and which are not. Once I have my list twm and Tuesday will focus on replicating the issues that were found to be significant. The good news is that I finally have enough responces to potentially look into rebar on nvidia. The current issues I wont be able to look into because of not enough reposnces are AMD vs Nvidia GPUs, weather or not nvidia GFE causes issues (Since I dont have alot of people with it uninstalled), weather antivirus software causes issues, weather HDR causes issues, weather HVCI causes issues, or weather ReBar on AMD causes issues. But with that I can list now all the things I plan on investigating and its a doozy of a list. HAGS on\/off, Windows 10 vs 11, Steam VR priority, VBS, RGB Apps, Chatting Apps, ReBar on Nvidia, Intel Based systems vs AMD based systems, Single vs Multiple Monitors, FPS Vr Windows 11 fix, Ryzen CCX complexes (1 vs 2), and Memory OC. If you want to continue to follow my progress from here on out later today ill be making a temporary google site that'll show which results from the survey are significant and what have i found. I also plan in about a week or 2 posting a new post here on reddit with my preliminary findings. Hopefully I can get to the bottom of this issue for users. Mentally I'm here: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/PDE9b5iU8vI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PDE9b5iU8vI)\n\nDay 5: This will be my last daily update for awhile, I have some results. The main things as of right now are for those experiencing issues to try going down to only one monitor and to turn of hardware accelerated GPU scheduling. I also am still in the early stages of what's becoming the largest part of this investigation and will take the most time the windows scheduler investigation. I hope to confirm that a program like project lasso can control how windows interacts with all this stuff. The main thing on that is to set all VR stuff to high priority and to ensure windows dynamic scheduling is set to off. My hope is to have more information soon. I plan to have my first update post on April 13th, with the results so far what I have found and what's left to be done. Please do the survey like I keep saying. Ill be posting updates as comments and in the google spreadsheet from here on out.\n\nI have some good leads and basically confirmed today that HAGS and multiple monitors can cause issues. I also noted that taking steamVR out of focus on windows 11 tanks its priority causing stuttering. Further testing revealed that using a program such as process lasso to force high priority all the time resolved the issue. ReBar is twms project along with memory OC. Will still update this post as trying to put together a google site failed.\n\nDay 6: this entirely blew past me, but the constant pink lines issue has now a steamVR beta update 1.22.5 that has fixed the issue. In my testing SteamVR now works on windows 11 with HAGS disabled. This means for all intents and purposes this survey is basically dead as that's the issue this was trying to solve. If the SteamVR beta doesn't help anyone please let me know, otherwise the direction of the report has shifted to settings users should try in the event they are still having issues. I'm glad the issues fixed and I'm glad valve fixed it. Thanks to  u\/miguel_cdlg and u\/aleiby for finding and fixing the windows 11 issues.\n\nI shouldn't say its dead users are still having issues its just the major one has been fixed. The new reality of the report will be a series of setting I found that affect VR performance and should be tried for users havening issues. For those experiencing system and game and vr crashes, this is most likely a hardware issue. For those experiencing occasional stuttering please update your drivers. Otherwise the final report will mostly mention the work I did on the last official release of SteamVR and suggest a series of diagnostic steps for users to try before they reach out to SteamVR support. I'm sorry I wasn't able to be of much help to the community.\n\nDay 7: Man day 6 sounded depressing, sorry for that. Anyways the reality is I will have some new settings for people to try after my results. While the main stuttering issue is resolved, I do think about it like a stability thing. It'll be like steamVR works when the systems stable and doing fine but these things agitate it just enough to potentially cause issues. I'm going on a trip for the next couple of days and am mostly focusing on making the first draft of the report. Hopefully I can still add some value to the community. This post is getting really messy so will make a formal update post sometime next week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Day my fellow SteamVR users. My name is Sdrft1, and for a little background I have B.S. In Biochemistry and have specific coursework to data collection and interpretation using statistical methods. In this regard and after seeing countless Windows 11 VR threads go down in smoke with debates between those with working installs and those without working installs I've decided it would be best to bring some science to the table. In basic TLDR fashion I'm taking a survey to try and find what may be causing issues while Using SteamVR in windows 11 and what we as a community can do to fix it and provide concrete guidance to help with those experiencing issues. The main issue we are trying to solve can be found in this thread here: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa\\_dont\\_upgrade\\_to\\_windows\\_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/trnncb\/psa_dont_upgrade_to_windows_11\/i2p87um\/?context=3)\n\nTo start I want to say if you are on windows 11 and experiencing no issues, that's great! I would still love your response so I can determine what might be causing issues by comparing those with issues to those without issues.\n\nIf your experiencing issues, I'm sorry to hear that. I know it can be frustrating to not be able to use something you paid for, and I feel you. If you could also answer my survey that would be great as well.\n\nIf you are on windows 10, I would also love your response to be able to hone if this is a windows 11 specific issue or an issue with something larger, so I would love your response as well\n\nAs of now those on linux are more than welcome to converse but if you don't have a windows machine then I'm not looking for a response from you at this time, but your insight would be excellent in the comments of this thread.\n\nIf you are not using SteamVR please also at this time do not respond. This is specifically investigating issues related to SteamVR and the recent windows update.\n\nIf you are seeing this I've made a google form to collect data on everything from PC specs and settings. This is a very detailed form and I'm more than happy to help find any sort of information needed. That form is found at both the top of this post and here: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSd7mCS1XqMKWrGEGRIV7UWjRCJB7zw0UDj5Xio4Mlr2WDb6Jw\/viewform?usp=sf\\_link](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSd7mCS1XqMKWrGEGRIV7UWjRCJB7zw0UDj5Xio4Mlr2WDb6Jw\/viewform?usp=sf_link) . This doesn't require a sign in so please to try and keep data clean don't comment more than once. Those 18 and under, or whatever the age of maturity is in your locality, should not use this form without a parent or guardians permission.\n\nIf after submitting your above your countries age of maturity and would like to help with testing after I get responses and start to see patterns Ill post in comments things I would like further investigation on in the comments.\n\nAs per the scientist in me this is the type of disclosure statement I was taught to write up: All attempts have been made in the making of this survey as anonymously as possible including the inability to take any sort of emails or contacts from the form itself. This research will also be preformed in public with a release of information found publicly at the end of this survey. No private messages will be sent either from me and should not be sent to me. In the event you need to make a concern known please make it known in the comments of this post. If you believe the survey could be improved in any way please also make that known in the comments of this post. Individuals are more that welcome to cross post this to communities they deem may be helpful, however users should be directed towards putting their comments in the original post on r\/SteamVR. In the event you believe either a breach or privacy or other issues have occurred please let me know as soon as you believe so the matter can be addressed publicly. The survey will run for at this point an undetermined amount of time until as such clear patterns and trends can emerge for further investigation. At this time the research will be posted in English and an interpreter is not available to participants. Any attempt to post inappropriate or off topic responses to either this post or the google form, the mods or other appropriate bodies will be notified. The author of this survey declares no competing interests.\n\nThe results are located here if anyone sees a trend I don't please let me know [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WTCfSQ3mXHvWwstk\\_0YLRX3-OXmqaDk3Epmk2xr8tXA\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WTCfSQ3mXHvWwstk_0YLRX3-OXmqaDk3Epmk2xr8tXA\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"SteamVR","subreddit_id":"t5_2zr8m","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/SteamVR","subreddit_subscribers":92663,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Windows 11\/10 VR Intermittent\/Constant Stuttering or Issue Investigation Survey","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tscnvo\/windows_1110_vr_intermittentconstant_stuttering\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"mrLimX","author_created_utc":1635901645,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_g323u3cd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1648457703,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.SteamVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"tq4zi0","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"0ed9a6ce-1b99-11ec-bdc6-8afcaa441d3b","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_tq4zi0","no_follow":false,"num_comments":2,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/SteamVR\/comments\/tq4zi0\/summary_of_the_pimax_12k_live_joyful_or\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"c4DM6MDDGfRR0KT_u6LA46XWEFEC-qu_-VDM2PbCTWs","resolutions":[{"height":55,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dece5eb24042979c8da96216d355e02ba58dde5c","width":108},{"height":110,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af1402d42dd847b52a41d226983d32789de061cc","width":216},{"height":164,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe22a39dc2ebd72c5864bcd3b73d704faaf3db95","width":320},{"height":328,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=572e81b81171cfac199e7ef4a28f5892b8bb3dcd","width":640},{"height":492,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2604284ecd44f01995b770bdb08e6bc3d6d0261","width":960},{"height":554,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc048e1b686139eca76ee5a232476017dc4c0600","width":1080}],"source":{"height":580,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/eoyTPDDknNuxGew5YFHjcG7kgXTdNooHN4SpINJHR3s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=96823d0a8582e97cf663302f1900c2eda3ba21b2","width":1130},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654039706,"retrieved_utc":1654039706,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"*  The \"secret\" to removing artifacts would come from using Tobii's eye-tracking.\n* The 60 GHz wireless connection between PC and viewer will be made with a Wigig device.\n* The viewfinder will have active cooling through fans, quieter than those of the Vive Focus 3.\n* With the battery on, the viewer will be heavier than the 8K model, but still comfortable.\n* Improved audio system, use the XR2 chip for internal audio processing and other factors.\n* Automatic IPD adjustment.\n* The sweet spot, black levels, and colors are also excellent.\n* In standalone mode, the FOV, resolution, and refresh rate will be lower.\n* Inside-out tracking.

Rick and Morty begins to load, gives me the \"Next Up\" screen, then the thumbnail changes to Home and I get booted right back into Home. I've tried launching from Desktop steam, even choosing \"Steam VR Mode\" (though I'm guessing that only relates to controls), but nothing seems to work. Star Trek Bridge Crew has this exact same problem, and Trover just sits forever on the Next Up screen, doesn't even boot me into Home.\n\nI've tried verifying files of these games but to no avail. My PC is more than beefy enough to handle Alyx on max settings, so that can't be it.\n\nAll the other posts I could find were about either black screens or straight up crashing to desktop, neither of which seem to apply here. It seems the games just decide nah, go back home son.\n\nAny ideas? \n\nAlso, if anyone knows how to prevent head tracking from getting jittery as a rattlesnake with parkinsons whenever I open Opera browser on the desktop, I'd be eternally grateful.\n\nCheers!\n\n**EDIT: Fixed it!** Turns out it's a problem with Ice Lake (10th gen) and Rocket Lake (11th Gen) Intel CPUs, or more accurately a problem with Unreal Engine games due to a bug in UE that is only apparent on those CPUs and still isn't patched 6 years later. \n\nThere's a simple fix [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PavlovGame\/comments\/n3hllx\/workaround_for_crash_on_launch_bug_for_11gen\/), which I'll also copy here in case that link goes down (like had happened already in the comments of that thread).\n\n&gt;Press Win + E or open File Explorer, right-click on \u201cThis PC,\u201d and choose \u201cProperties.
