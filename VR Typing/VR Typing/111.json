It honestly ended up being a worse experience than Dex plugged directly into the xreal glasses, let alone the vitures that don't even need the neckband to pin a screen. \n\nOkay, okay, I thought, this is primarily a gaming headset, let me use it for that. So I connect it to my steam via steam link and boot up phasmo and I'm just amazed again at how little the technology has evolved in the nearly decade since the PSVR released. Okay, yes it's inside it tracking and wireless, but none of that is exactly be technology either. Steam link\/moonlight\/remote play, plenty of ways to do this type of thing for years. I mean hell back when destiny first launched I was able to do my dailies off my cell phone in my biochem lecture hall and even before that, my first time playing Arkham City when it launched was via a streaming service.\n\nBut here's the big problem with VR gaming imo and why it hasn't caught on, and imo probably never will, at least not in it's current form. The controllers. VR gaming and gamers are so OBSESSED with showing off the immersion of the technology that it absolutely ruins games. The VR controllers are so limited because \"why would you press Y to change your gun when you can just reach over your shoulder or grab your pistol from your hip\" simple because I don't fucking want to do that, I want to sit back, relax, and play some video games.\n\nThis is something I noticed back on the PSVR, while yeah getting to play Skyrim in VR was fun for a bit, I quickly grew tired of playing it the \"VR way\" but luckily there was a native control scheme and I could just use my ds4 and head and it was a great experience, because I could still relax and play games, but also feel like I was completely a part of the world. And then there was far point, which to this day, is the best example of what VR gaming can and should be. It came with it's own controller,b loosely shaped after a rifle, but most importantly, it has every button a normal controller would have, which meant I was not limited in how I played the game. I could easily play the game on 100% immersion mode where I was standing and basically only used the the trigger and directional stick as inputs or I could just as easily lay back on the couch and play the game like I would halo, just with the added bonus of hey I can turn my head to look around.\n\nThe quest controllers can never do something like this though, because even though there's the huge space on top where both a standard d-pad and even a stream deck sized track pad could easily fit, especially if you have abxy all on the right controller, we're instead limited. This isn't too mention the paddles that could easily be added to the controller. I mean honestly not entirely sure why there is a thumbstick for looking around, the one thing VR does incredibly well, but there's not a dpad. \n\nImo videogames are something that most people do to relax, but VR seems to strive to make it impossible to relax while gaming, it wants to force you to be up and moving while you're playing. The xreals do a great job of immersing me in the game already and yeah there are plenty of times where I want to get up and more into the game, but that is decidedly not the mood I was in when I started gaming, the game was just that good that it made me want to do more. VR gaming just doesn't offer that opportunity to start out with a relaxed session and hype up into an immersive session, so to me it remains a part trick. \n\nI've had headset for about a month now and there's been a couple times where I've been playing a regular game and it's hyped up into wanting to transition to a VR game, but then I didn't feel like dealing with the headset and piss poor paasthrough mode. \n\nSo my question VR gamers of Reddit, are there any games that allow you to relax and game? Because thus far everything I've tried I just think to myself \"what a great party trick,\" everything but the passthrough mode, that's just a terrible feature IMO, I tried washing dishes with it on and had to completely redo them after because the cameras just straight blurred out how dirty they remained","author_fullname":"t2_2wnwjq4f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Someone convince me not to return the Quest 3","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18qzx0m","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703565726.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t my first time using VR, long ago I had the og psvr, but I&amp;#39;ve always primarily been a PC gamer and have followed the development of VR pretty closely since (mostly been waiting on a decent standalone oled headset), as well as I&amp;#39;ve tried out some friends quest 2s.

(Yes I have checked out the FAQ, I just want to be certain before I make any expensive purchases, I'm intellectually disabled too and I struggle to infer the answers I need unless the given advice is ultra specific.)\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. Tray table with a desk mat so I can use either a wireless keyboard\/mouse setup or a long ass wire connected to my computer\n2. VR headset connected by display port to my PC, which isn't too far from my bed\n3. Wear VR headset in bed, play PC games from bed, voila no sitting up required.\n\nThe idea isn't to be fully immersed in a 3D landscape, I basically want to simulate looking at a flat monitor. I just want a way to play regular non-VR video games while lying down. I can touch type very well so seeing my keyboard isn't an issue.\n\nI used to play on my former housemate's Quest 2 sometimes but we pretty much exclusively used the controllers that came with it to play actual VR games. I've never tried using it as a regular monitor and idk if that's even possible.\n\nLike as an example I have Baldurs Gate 3 running on my PC right now, if I plugged in a standard headset would I be able to play it from bed?\n\nSorry again if this is a silly question. I just thought it might be worth asking before I throw out the whole idea. Anything that can make gaming more accessible to me as a disabled person would be amazing :-)","author_fullname":"t2_v5byqy7q","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"VR Headset as a replacement monitor for gaming in bed?","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18m29rd","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1702993633.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please read the whole post before replying!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Context: I&amp;#39;m quite profoundly physically disabled and I love PC gaming.

what a tech enthusiast I am, I am as clueless when it comes to VR experiences and VR gaming.\n\nI was looking into the Meta Quest 2 and 3 and I'd like to know what what would be the best purchase given the following context(any other recommendations are appreciated as long as it's in a similar budget bracket):\n\n* The person in question will be using it mainly for steam games such as Phasmophobia, Half Life Alyx etc.\n\n* If there is nice \"meta exclusive games\/content\" perhaps he will try those as well.\n\n* The person has never experienced VR before, so if there is stuff like \"VR movies\" and other experiences like that, I would gladly appreciate some resources on that.\n\n\nSo. From what I understand, steam games must be played connected via cable? If so, how long is it? Is there a quality impact on the perceived quality? Are the larger storage options needed given this situation? Or is even the computing power of the Quest 3 required at all? Like... if the game is played via steam, isn't the process running on-pc rather than on-device?\n\nAnd how do the specs fare? Is there an obvious bump in image quality or.... sound quality or... controllers etc?\n\nSo currently where I live, the Meta Quest 3 is 600 euros for the 128 option and like 950 euros for the 512 one.\n\nThe Meta Quest 2 is 400 euros for the 128 option + resident evil 4 as bonus, and 450 euros for the 256 option, without a bonus game.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 512gb variant is probably out of the question given the price bump, but what would you choose between the other 3?

Is there an obvious bump in image quality or.... sound quality or... controllers etc?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So currently where I live, the Meta Quest 3 is 600 euros for the 128 option and like 950 euros for the 512 one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Meta Quest 2 is 400 euros for the 128 option + resident evil 4 as bonus, and 450 euros for the 256 option, without a bonus game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Meta Quest 3 512gb variant is probably out of the question given the price bump, but what would you choose between the other 3? (or any other headset that might fit the budget)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance and I wish you the best!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"17xy4qt","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Vyalkuran","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17xy4qt\/i_want_to_gift_a_vr_headset_any_advice\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17xy4qt\/i_want_to_gift_a_vr_headset_any_advice\/","subreddit_subscribers":113829,"created_utc":1700280771.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"There's a stigma since the existence of gaming that video games are \"bad for you\", especially if played extensively. Spine issues, heart issues, muscle inactivity, and many more health-related as well as lifestyle-related issues have been linked to video games, possibly for a good reason. It's easy to fall into the grasp of addiction and just crash all your free time into the world's most subtle escape from reality. Buried under the pile of countless critics, gaming has had more than a fair share of judgment from all social groups. Well, I'm here to offer another perspective - an outlook on how video games changed someone's life for the better and helped them become a better human being overall.\n\nI'd like to start with the negatives. Addiction to video games? 3 times. And 3 solid recoveries. With the experience I have today, I can say that every time my life went downhill, video games substituted as life's motherly arms for all my fears and burdens. But as every baby bird has to leave its nest at some point, I did too. Along this journey, I discovered VR gaming which at first, looked like another cool way of spending my time in the virtual world. Playing games like **Half-Life: Alyx**, Into the Radius, Clash of Chefs, and others gave me a new perspective of how awesome gaming *could* be in the future, but also a new idea. What if I could utilize the new dimension inherent only to VR to my advantage? What if I could improve my life *while* doing something I love, and turn my prolonged gaming periods that would otherwise have a negative impact on my health into something that would improve me physically, while also helping me deal with my mental issues? What if I could turn this into a win-win situation?\n\n**Fitness games &amp; their benefits**\n\nThe \"dimension inherent to VR\" I mentioned before refers mainly to the 3rd dimension present in VR gaming that's absent in all other forms of gaming. Similarly to how the Heliocentric system changed our entire understanding of how the world around us functioned, the physicality of the VR's third dimension changed my perception of how gaming could work. Instead of being stuck to a chair and looking into a 2D, flat screen for hours, I had the opportunity to play while being active in my room, with my body as a controller. That's when I looked for ways to combine the enjoyment of playing a game with the perk of being physically active and ultimately decided on 2 games.\n\nI got myself **Beat Saber** and **PowerBeatsVR**, of which the latter provided me with an exceptional way to keep my body in shape. Just a few high intensity runs in this game made me fight for breath completely covered in sweat, even though I wasn't *that* out of shape. The most important part for me was the option to choose my own music because the music I enjoy changes depending on my mood, and when I'm not mentally well, my mood changes rather quickly. Even irl I jump between oldschool rock, blues, powermetal, and folk music literally song by song. I made a plan and stuck to it - daily runs of 30 to 60 minutes in PowerBeatsVR with my own, custom songs, and as hard as I could go. I lost a few pounds, tightened my muscles, and overall felt much more energized on a daily basis due to being physically active. The best part was that I was enjoying every moment in the game because it represented something familiar and safe to me - a *video game* with real video game features, cool sceneries, etc. If you're struggling right now with improving your physical fitness or just want to do something healthy for yourself in your free time, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game. It works even for people who are extremely out of shape or injured because you can choose your own pace.\n\nI'd also recommend Beat Saber for the same purpose. It's leaning more toward the *game* than the *fitness* part, but it'll also burn a few calories if you do the runs correctly. Just be careful not to dislocate or hurt your shoulder\/arm (it happened to me twice) and make sure to warm up properly before doing harder runs (especially if you're above 30 hahaha). Either way, you'll have a ton of fun while doing something good for yourself, and that's always a plus.\n\n**Mental health benefits**\n\nNow, this is one of the things VR games share with flatscreen games - mental health benefits - although I'd argue VR games could have an edge solely because of the unmatched immersiveness. I can't explain how much **Into the Radius** and **Resident Evil 4 VR** helped me deal with anxiety, an issue I'd been battling for years. Playing these games helped me get in touch with my anxious side and understand fear better, at least in terms of how it functions in my dysfunctional body. I could sense and tell apart real fear from anxious attacks, and subsequently deal with them before they get control over me. Plus, my fear tolerance increased significantly.\n\nThen I'd also like to mention the games like **Deisim** or **cyubeVR** that provide a cozy and fun environment to just lose yourself in, relax, and have fun. If life gets too rough, this could be the right way to deal with it, although be careful not to stray too far.\n\n**Fun &amp; Entertainment**\n\nLast but not least, VR games have always provided so much fun to me for a very affordable price. One of the reasons I became a gamer as a kid was because my family didn't do too well financially. We sometimes couldn't afford to go to lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., and I as a kid learned to cherish and save every $ we had. Video games were the cheapest form of entertainment I could have - $500 for a PC that lasted for 4 years and $10-$30 per game was so much cheaper than going out to cafes, bars, and when online games came around, I could even hang out with friends while playing games.\n\nIn today's world, VR is arguably one of the best ways to have fun and experience some things second-handedly while being in the comfort of your home and saving your money. With so many simulators and interesting apps out there, virtually anything from the real world can be done in VR with a bit of creativity. Although I'm not an expert, some games still left an oustanding impact on me - **Wooorld**, **Bartender Simulator VR**, **Cooking Simulator VR**, **Clash of Chefs**, **Nature Treks VR**, and **The Climb**.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nTo wrap this up, I'll return to the beginning of the article and say that VR, like any other form of gaming, can impact your life negatively if used excessively. No matter how good you feel doing even some cool, extraordinary things in VR, don't do it too much or too obsessively. HOWEVER, if you want to utilize VR to your advantage, I'd say the games I mentioned in this post could be perfect for that. PowerBeatsVR will help you get in shape for sure, and you'll have a ton of fun doing it. Into the Radius could help you deal with anxiety, but don't force yourself too much if the feeling overwhelms you. The Climb is a solid climbing simulator and it'll let you experience the sport second-hand, without you risking anything. There are more examples like Nature Treks VR which lets you experience the immersiveness of nature without having to step a foot outside, or Beat Saber which will have you burning extra calories while competing for high scores in a rhythm game. And these are only some examples that I've done in the past, just imagine how much more is out there.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, VR games helped me change my life for the better and find new ways of bettering myself in things I've never thought possible before. Hope it does the same for you.\n\nCheers!\n\n\\*NOTE - I highlighted all the games so you don't have to go through the blocks of text searching for them in case you wanna look them up.","author_fullname":"t2_rzvf7gwg","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"VR games changed my life for the better and I'm tremendously thankful for experiencing this form of gaming","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17wbfy6","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700101494.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a stigma since the existence of gaming that video games are &amp;quot;bad for you&amp;quot;, especially if played extensively.

Spine issues, heart issues, muscle inactivity, and many more health-related as well as lifestyle-related issues have been linked to video games, possibly for a good reason. It&amp;#39;s easy to fall into the grasp of addiction and just crash all your free time into the world&amp;#39;s most subtle escape from reality. Buried under the pile of countless critics, gaming has had more than a fair share of judgment from all social groups. Well, I&amp;#39;m here to offer another perspective - an outlook on how video games changed someone&amp;#39;s life for the better and helped them become a better human being overall.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to start with the negatives. Addiction to video games? 3 times. And 3 solid recoveries. With the experience I have today, I can say that every time my life went downhill, video games substituted as life&amp;#39;s motherly arms for all my fears and burdens. But as every baby bird has to leave its nest at some point, I did too. Along this journey, I discovered VR gaming which at first, looked like another cool way of spending my time in the virtual world. Playing games like &lt;strong&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;\/strong&gt;, Into the Radius, Clash of Chefs, and others gave me a new perspective of how awesome gaming &lt;em&gt;could&lt;\/em&gt; be in the future, but also a new idea. What if I could utilize the new dimension inherent only to VR to my advantage? What if I could improve my life &lt;em&gt;while&lt;\/em&gt; doing something I love, and turn my prolonged gaming periods that would otherwise have a negative impact on my health into something that would improve me physically, while also helping me deal with my mental issues? What if I could turn this into a win-win situation?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness games &amp;amp; their benefits&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;dimension inherent to VR&amp;quot; I mentioned before refers mainly to the 3rd dimension present in VR gaming that&amp;#39;s absent in all other forms of gaming. Similarly to how the Heliocentric system changed our entire understanding of how the world around us functioned, the physicality of the VR&amp;#39;s third dimension changed my perception of how gaming could work. Instead of being stuck to a chair and looking into a 2D, flat screen for hours, I had the opportunity to play while being active in my room, with my body as a controller. That&amp;#39;s when I looked for ways to combine the enjoyment of playing a game with the perk of being physically active and ultimately decided on 2 games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got myself &lt;strong&gt;Beat Saber&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PowerBeatsVR&lt;\/strong&gt;, of which the latter provided me with an exceptional way to keep my body in shape. Just a few high intensity runs in this game made me fight for breath completely covered in sweat, even though I wasn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;that&lt;\/em&gt; out of shape. The most important part for me was the option to choose my own music because the music I enjoy changes depending on my mood, and when I&amp;#39;m not mentally well, my mood changes rather quickly. Even irl I jump between oldschool rock, blues, powermetal, and folk music literally song by song. I made a plan and stuck to it - daily runs of 30 to 60 minutes in PowerBeatsVR with my own, custom songs, and as hard as I could go. I lost a few pounds, tightened my muscles, and overall felt much more energized on a daily basis due to being physically active. The best part was that I was enjoying every moment in the game because it represented something familiar and safe to me - a &lt;em&gt;video game&lt;\/em&gt; with real video game features, cool sceneries, etc. If you&amp;#39;re struggling right now with improving your physical fitness or just want to do something healthy for yourself in your free time, I&amp;#39;d wholeheartedly recommend this game. It works even for people who are extremely out of shape or injured because you can choose your own pace.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also recommend Beat Saber for the same purpose. It&amp;#39;s leaning more toward the &lt;em&gt;game&lt;\/em&gt; than the &lt;em&gt;fitness&lt;\/em&gt; part, but it&amp;#39;ll also burn a few calories if you do the runs correctly. Just be careful not to dislocate or hurt your shoulder\/arm (it happened to me twice) and make sure to warm up properly before doing harder runs (especially if you&amp;#39;re above 30 hahaha). Either way, you&amp;#39;ll have a ton of fun while doing something good for yourself, and that&amp;#39;s always a plus.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental health benefits&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, this is one of the things VR games share with flatscreen games - mental health benefits - although I&amp;#39;d argue VR games could have an edge solely because of the unmatched immersiveness. I can&amp;#39;t explain how much &lt;strong&gt;Into the Radius&lt;\/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;\/strong&gt; helped me deal with anxiety, an issue I&amp;#39;d been battling for years. Playing these games helped me get in touch with my anxious side and understand fear better, at least in terms of how it functions in my dysfunctional body. I could sense and tell apart real fear from anxious attacks, and subsequently deal with them before they get control over me. Plus, my fear tolerance increased significantly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;d also like to mention the games like &lt;strong&gt;Deisim&lt;\/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;cyubeVR&lt;\/strong&gt; that provide a cozy and fun environment to just lose yourself in, relax, and have fun. If life gets too rough, this could be the right way to deal with it, although be careful not to stray too far.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun &amp;amp; Entertainment&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, VR games have always provided so much fun to me for a very affordable price. One of the reasons I became a gamer as a kid was because my family didn&amp;#39;t do too well financially. We sometimes couldn&amp;#39;t afford to go to lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., and I as a kid learned to cherish and save every $ we had. Video games were the cheapest form of entertainment I could have - $500 for a PC that lasted for 4 years and $10-$30 per game was so much cheaper than going out to cafes, bars, and when online games came around, I could even hang out with friends while playing games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s world, VR is arguably one of the best ways to have fun and experience some things second-handedly while being in the comfort of your home and saving your money. With so many simulators and interesting apps out there, virtually anything from the real world can be done in VR with a bit of creativity. Although I&amp;#39;m not an expert, some games still left an oustanding impact on me - &lt;strong&gt;Wooorld&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bartender Simulator VR&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cooking Simulator VR&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clash of Chefs&lt;\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nature Treks VR&lt;\/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Climb&lt;\/strong&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, I&amp;#39;ll return to the beginning of the article and say that VR, like any other form of gaming, can impact your life negatively if used excessively. No matter how good you feel doing even some cool, extraordinary things in VR, don&amp;#39;t do it too much or too obsessively. HOWEVER, if you want to utilize VR to your advantage, I&amp;#39;d say the games I mentioned in this post could be perfect for that. PowerBeatsVR will help you get in shape for sure, and you&amp;#39;ll have a ton of fun doing it. Into the Radius could help you deal with anxiety, but don&amp;#39;t force yourself too much if the feeling overwhelms you. The Climb is a solid climbing simulator and it&amp;#39;ll let you experience the sport second-hand, without you risking anything. There are more examples like Nature Treks VR which lets you experience the immersiveness of nature without having to step a foot outside, or Beat Saber which will have you burning extra calories while competing for high scores in a rhythm game. And these are only some examples that I&amp;#39;ve done in the past, just imagine how much more is out there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s all said and done, VR games helped me change my life for the better and find new ways of bettering myself in things I&amp;#39;ve never thought possible before. Hope it does the same for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*NOTE - I highlighted all the games so you don&amp;#39;t have to go through the blocks of text searching for them in case you wanna look them up.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c0266eea-07f8-11e6-bd33-0ebd65f9ef9d","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","id":"17wbfty","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"RajesAnu78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17wbfty\/vr_games_changed_my_life_for_the_better_and_im\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17wbfty\/vr_games_changed_my_life_for_the_better_and_im\/","subreddit_subscribers":113736,"created_utc":1700101484.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"so I've added 2 tb's of WD blue and I have had some problems with it but I don't want to rma it (it takes a while to get to the place and I don't want to ship it) but I have been trying to fix all of these small problems and then... this major problem with vr i simply can't get it to run smoothly anymore (cpu gpu is 5800x and 6750xt)  and its starting to drive me nuts that i can't play vr games anymore since i have been getting more active since getting a new vr headset since my old quest 2 controllers broke (stick drift)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhere's every problem ive had so far this is vr and pcmr related since its just a platform thing but i was hoping someone would know a answer to fix this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nvr gets laggy from smoother MS times.\n\nvr's audio becomes impossible to listen to with the constant cuts and audio crackling.\n\ngeneral sound is cutting and crackling sometimes, or a lot depends on how what my pc decided today.\n\ncourser gets choppy or simply just breaks.\n\ngames have dropped marginally in fps (haven't been able to test vr yet because of trying to fix the issues thus new windows installation\n\nvideos (any kind even live ones (yes that's any kind) start to break after a few minutes by blacking out super looping?

I've been VR gaming since the oculus Rift came out, but I haven't upgraded headsets since the Rift S. I have never used any of the quest headsets before, or any wireless headset for that matter. 99% of the time when I'm in VR I am playing a flight simulator (DCS world) so I don't need wireless that badly. I play a few other games with friends so wireless would be nice then I guess. I remember when I upgraded to the Rift S I was blown away by how much clearer the image was, I could finally actually read the text in cockpits! Since I've never used another headset I really can't imagine how it could look better than the Rift S. The thing that annoys me most about the Rift S is how buggy it is. I frequently have to spend more time fixing problems than actually gaming. Would the quest 3 be more reliable in this regard?

I have never used any of the quest headsets before, or any wireless headset for that matter. 99% of the time when I&amp;#39;m in VR I am playing a flight simulator (DCS world) so I don&amp;#39;t need wireless that badly. I play a few other games with friends so wireless would be nice then I guess. I remember when I upgraded to the Rift S I was blown away by how much clearer the image was, I could finally actually read the text in cockpits! Since I&amp;#39;ve never used another headset I really can&amp;#39;t imagine how it could look better than the Rift S. The thing that annoys me most about the Rift S is how buggy it is. I frequently have to spend more time fixing problems than actually gaming. Would the quest 3 be more reliable in this regard? I want to buy a quest 3, I just want to make sure the upgrade is big enough to be justifiable. Thanks!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"175ip73","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Flarhgunstow","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/175ip73\/should_i_upgrade_from_rift_s_to_quest_3\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/175ip73\/should_i_upgrade_from_rift_s_to_quest_3\/","subreddit_subscribers":111040,"created_utc":1697042717.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"Body text","author_fullname":"t2_i0wd8enu2","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Anyone know any vr blacksmithing games","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_16uwsjo","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1695947251.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Body text&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"16uwsjo","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"destiny2forlife123","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/16uwsjo\/anyone_know_any_vr_blacksmithing_games\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/16uwsjo\/anyone_know_any_vr_blacksmithing_games\/","subreddit_subscribers":109791,"created_utc":1695947251.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"For some context, I'm on the autism spectrum with processing delays, I struggle with communication in real life where I'm completely mute unless I've gotten to know them over time (Often weeks or months), and it's something people expect me to be good at.

I\u2019m trying to stay around $500 Canadian.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any advice you can provide&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"14vgvbu","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Nerdherder72","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":18,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14vgvbu\/more_recent_thoughts_on_rx_6700_xt_for_meta_quest\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14vgvbu\/more_recent_thoughts_on_rx_6700_xt_for_meta_quest\/","subreddit_subscribers":108609,"created_utc":1688954982.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vonx0npsqh8b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0ac6071aae02aed2c718f7b2872467f44e52c5e0\n\n**Introduction:** In the realm of vision-based technologies, two titans have emerged: [Apple Vision Pro](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-vision-pro\/) and [Meta Quest 3](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/quest\/quest-3\/). These innovative systems have redefined the way we interact with devices, introducing advanced capabilities that blur the lines between the real and virtual worlds. In this article, we will compare the features and functionalities of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3, shedding light on their key differences and potential impact on various industries.\n\n**Object Recognition:** Both Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 excel in object recognition capabilities.

you ever played Pavlov VR, then this game will be borderline unplayable for you. In less than two hours of gameplay I got a whole bucket list of complaints, and I fear what else there may be.\n\nGeneral information:\n\n* you pick a dominant hand: any weapon you ever pick up will automatically be held according to your dominant hand, no swapping between hands!\n\n* letting go of a weapon returns it to your inventory instead of falling to the ground\n\n* there is no single-fire\/auto-fire toggle button\n\n* you can't grab the guns to cycle the rounds manually\n\n* you reload by bringing the clip\/magazine near the gun and letting go instead of pushing it in like in Pavlov VR, letting go is extremely unintuitive in this context\n\n* if you empty the clip early, you still need to cock the gun after reloading even if you still had a bullet in the chamber\n\nAnything bolt-action:\n\n* you don't need to reload, only cycle the bolt, you will always have one bullet in the chamber\n\n* if you shoot, put the gun back in the inventory, then take it out, it will do the worst thing where your 2nd hand will ALWAYS GRAB THE BOLT TO CYCLE IT BACK\n\nGrenade:\n\n* if you pull the pin, you automatically throw the lever as well, which means that the grenade is cocked as soon as you throw the pin and can't time your throws\n\nLever action:\n\n* actually implemented in a fun way, the lever reload is done as you'd expect by doing the appropriate hand motion\n\n* bonus points for ability to do it Terminator-style in one hand\n\n* but the actual bullet reload is done by PRESSING THE A BUTTON AND ALL THE BULLETS MAGICALLY GO IN\n\n* this also applies to shotguns, and I believe anything where you would insert bullets in one by one: you press A and it reloads for you. Why? This is terrible.\n\nSniper rifle:\n\n* look through the scope\n\n* IT BECOMES FULL. FUCKING.

As the launch title for the PSVR2, Sony are hoping the Horizon franchise is a big enough draw card to entice a raft of new gamers to the still-emerging medium. But, cautioned by the response to titles such as Half-Life: Alyx\u2014still the locus classicus of AAA VR gaming\u2014nobody is pretending this could be the \u201ckiller app\u201d that brings virtual reality to mainstream prominence, or even widespread usage within the gaming community. \n\nSo it\u2019s hard not to think of Call of the Mountain as a pretty, shimmering blip on the radar, with its glistening jungle aesthetic and sun-soaked post-apocalyptic settings. That term, \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d, is more likely to conjure visions of Blade Runner-esque cities and Mad Max-like marauders than Horizon\u2019s pretty forests and mountain ranges. But there\u2019s a narrative logic for its lushness: this world is so post in its post-apocalyptia that destruction and decay are things of a distant past, preceding rebirth and renewal. The experience\u2019s eight hour-ish runtime offers many opportunities to savour the view, replete with profuse greenery, icy peaks and golden desert. \n\nIt\u2019s essentially a climbing simulator kitted up with various bells and whistles and an underlying hero narrative that uses literal ascension as a metaphor for overcoming personal demons and taking on oppressive power structures. The phrase \u201cthank the sun!\u201d is uttered by the participant-embodied warrior protagonist Ryas (voiced by Mark Allan Stewart) dozens of times, reflecting the primitive religiosity of this world, where humans share the landscape with dinosaur-ish robots\u2014some benevolent and others mad like flame-spewing dragons. Ryas, who belongs to a tribe called the Shadow Carja, replaces franchise heroine Aloy, seen briefly in an early and cursory cameo.\n\nThe experience begins on ground level, with the participant situated at the rear of a canoe-like vessel, during a water-set sequence that establishes environmental and storytelling context\u2014like the boat journeys at the beginning of The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners and its sequel. These scenarios have roots in riverboat rides and safari cruises (there\u2019s even a \u201cmachine safari\u201d mode unlocked upon the game\u2019s completion) and in VR adhere to a basic visual configuration: the participant being in a fixed position as the virtual bubble is moving. \n\nIn narrative terms, Ryas is in the boat because he's been freed from prison and offered a pardon\u2014on the proviso that he investigate why the aforementioned robo creatures have started to behave strangely. Ryas\u2019 investigations eventually lead to a key villain, who is using them for nefarious purposes, and also a familial connection. Both revelations occur very late into the experience. It\u2019s as if the writers realised they were missing fundamental narrative elements, and scrambled to whip a couple of underlying threads together\u2014coming up with too little too late.\n\nWhen the aforementioned canoe sequence ends in disaster, the core climbing mechanic is introduced and the journey upwards begins. The reliance on this mechanic makes the experience broadly comparable to The Climb and its sequel: two fleetingly enjoyable, rudimentary productions wholly devoted to executing a single concept, helping pave the way for more fleshed out experiences like Call of the Mountain. Video games and verticality have a long history, spanning literal examples\u2014all the way back to the original Donkey Kong, with old mate Mario ascending levels towards the barrel-hurling gorilla\u2014to the deeply embedded concept of leveling up. \n\nCall of the Mountain's repetitive but cathartic gameplay intensifies over time, particularly finding a groove in the last couple of hours\u2014when the climbing is combined with large moving parts, creating a more visceral sensation. When they're not climbing, the participant is generally either walking around (environments are navigated by swinging your real world arms, like in the excellent Westworld Awakening) or engaging in a wee bit of archery. Every once in a while there are robo-bosses to take down with your bow and slingshot; in these sequences ordinary navigation ceases, allowing only left and right movement\/strafing. \n\nThe stripping away of all other navigatory ability disrupts continuity and breaking immersion. It also concentrates the gameplay by drawing a simple set of combat rules, reflecting a broader experience that operates within clearly defined limitations. The climbing mechanics are simple; the rules of engagement easy to grasp; the path forward\u2014literally and narratively\u2014obvious. This clean-cut approach means there\u2019s rarely moments when the participant gets lost, muddled, or fed-up. With this kind of straightforwardness, it\u2019s a shame the story doesn\u2019t pick up the slack and invigorate an on-the-rails experience with more narrative flair.

my great excitement, Colossal Cave Adventure 3D was released the day after I bought an Oculus Quest 2.\n\nOne of my most treasured game experiences is receiving King\u2019s Quest VI for Christmas in 1993. I\u2019d played the earlier games at a friend\u2019s house (whose dad was a mathematician and knew about computers) and was already mesmerized by the concept of exploring a strange kingdom. Unlike Mario, Ninja Turtles, and R-Type\u2014which I also liked\u2014King\u2019s Quest wasn\u2019t twitchy, it was tranquil. I\u2019d go home and draw out my own map screens on sheets of paper. But KQ6 took the genre to the next level, with a regal VGA colour palette, crisp controls and sounds, and a complex story tree that broke beyond simple fairytale tropes.\n\nI became a Sierra acolyte. The tragic rise and fall of the company is well-known. King\u2019s Quest 7 for Windows 95 was cool, but buggy; and King\u2019s Quest 8, during Sierra\u2019s final, 3D era, was a disaster.\n\n1993 was the zenith the point-and-click adventure. Whether the subsequent decline of the genre was tied to the unfortunate demise of Sierra, or the inevitable consequence of the rise of the Internet and ready spoiler access, is hard to say. Sierra had always positioned its adventure games at the cutting edge of technology, and somewhere along the line, the aesthetic ceased to be charming. The adventure game had wandered into the uncanny valley.\n\nI hope this sets the stage for my great interest in Colossal Cave Adventure 3D, 30 years later. \n\nAfter losing Sierra due to the abuses of a deceptive businessman (detailed in Ken Williams\u2019 book, Not All Fairy Tales Have Happy Endings) Ken and Roberta sailed the world on their boat. Roberta had given up on game design, turning to historical fiction instead. This is until Ken wrote the book, and then began tinkering in Unity, when Roberta couldn\u2019t help but look over his shoulder.\n\nThe Williams\u2019 first game in 30 years isn\u2019t an original, but a remake, of the first adventure game from 1975, \u201cAdventure\u201d by Will Crowther. The Williams\u2019 have rebooted the Adventure genre to a time before King\u2019s Quest or Mystery House, restoring its primal iteration. Just as that game was made at a nascent stage of its medium (computer games as such) this one translates it into a nascent stage of a new medium\u2014Virtual Reality. Could something essential be recovered in the process?\n\nIn the hours I spent fooling around with VR before Colossal Cave was released, I did some poking around with whichever free games and demos I could find (the Quest store appears to have removed the filter that allows you to sort by free), and developed some strong first impressions. \n\nPeople assume VR is a continuation of PC gaming, but it\u2019s a radical break. PC games can be complex without being overstimulating. VR overwhelms the perceptual apparatus after a short amount of time. The heaviness of the headset, motion sickness and cognitive-optical effects are a part of it, but it\u2019s also the degree of media saturation. The metaverse is like existing in a slightly blurry medium-res Silver City world. Everything is bright, and busy, and smiley, and cartoony, and monetized. After 20 minutes you\u2019re feeling a bit barfy, and grateful for your real-reality, which suddenly appears to have great graphics.\n\nThis said, these negatives are balanced against positives. The ability of the medium to depict depth is just cool. I frequently find myself wanting to dive into another dimension for 10 or 15 minutes. I was telling a friend that, contrary to expectations, VR is less like a TV, and more like a swimming pool.\n\nI knew I liked Colossal Cave from the first minute I played it. It opens \u201cat the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully.\u201d Some string music plays. It\u2019s simple, clean, and bright. There\u2019s even a recommendation for an atypical approach to motion control, favoured by Roberta Williams.\n\nI felt like I was in the hands of an experienced, conscientious game designer, who didn\u2019t confuse dazzle with satisfaction.\n\nSo for me, the game was a win simply as a tech demo for a much-needed chill, explorative approach to VR.\n\nBut what about as a game? Is Colossal Cave Adventure fun?\n\nSomewhere in my spelunking, I started to lose faith. I started to wonder about the reasoning\u2014and the sense\u2014in porting this particular text adventure to VR. If Mario64 had been entirely underground it would have been a gloomy, claustrophobic entry to the N64. In most adventure games, you pick up a few items, mentally index the map, and solve some puzzles as you break through to new areas. In Colossal Cave, I couldn\u2019t solve a single puzzle, and the cave, and mental indexing, just kept going and going. When I finally found my way out of one long nondescript maze of tunnels, and then fell into another maze of identical corridors, I almost wondered if the remake itself was meant to be understood as a critique of VR itself as a long, dark, empty maze.\n\nThere\u2019s something a bit dead about it. Not enough other characters, or enough interaction. Maybe this is appropriate to a text-based adventure where one doesn\u2019t want to complicate things, but in a VR world, it\u2019s lonely walking around all by yourself. The gameplay of those Mario Galaxy games is incredible, but they also felt very Little Prince.\n\nBut the game\u2019s biggest flaw is its pace\u2014walking speed. The original has a sort of fast travel in that if you know your way around you can blaze from one end of the map to another with 10 keystrokes. Going from one end of the map to another in VR, and then up to the wellhouse and back takes ages, even with the magic phrases. I also often found myself getting stuck in the game\u2019s geometry and having to reset.\n\nI started having more fun when I realized that referencing the map the game provides is essential, and also when I gave in and started looking up some spoilers. Some of the puzzles are pure moon logic. Like being unable to pick up a bird because it\u2019s inexplicably afraid of the starred iron rod in our inventory. In a contemporary adventure game, we\u2019d expect some subtle cues to point us in the right direction. More significantly, I hadn\u2019t even gotten the memo that the purpose of the game was to recover 15 treasures from the cave back to the brick building.\n\nOnce I loosened up and the expansive map started to come into better mental focus for me, and I started to have more fun. It\u2019s not all tunnels and mazes, there\u2019s lots of cool vistas and other visual setpieces. This is around the time I appreciated the second major achievement of Colossal Cave. It\u2019s an incredible museum piece\u2014a testament to the greatness of the original game.\n\nI\u2019d played with the original when I heard this was coming out, and dismissed it as an antique. It\u2019s only as I started to get the hang of the game that I realized many of its brilliant nuances. The sheer variety of kinds of puzzles packed into one text-based game is astounding. Subtle, silly things. A precious vase you pick up shatters wherever you would set it down, so you need to place it on a rare pillow to save it. Sensible enough, but what\u2019s so unusual about this puzzle is that only a handful of items have environmental properties (such as shattering), so your brain isn\u2019t automatically syllogizing this item against that, deducing every possible outcome, because the parameters of the game aren\u2019t so determined. You kind of have to get a spark. You remember the spark? The game is filled with quirky little loose ends like this. Some of them are tedious, or moon logic, but there\u2019s a refreshing diversity of connections at play. I still finding myself wanting to go back for more.\n\nThis appreciation helped me wonder at the amount of atmosphere and complexity the original built out of plain text derived from 700 lines of code. For me, it evoked the weirdness of the fact that text, phrased a certain way, manifests as a sophisticated game. Crowthers said that the natural language input system gave users the illusion of control. It was cool to realize the \u2018logos\u2019 of so many of my favourite games was so simple, or rather, so fundamental. King\u2019s Quest VI could\u2019ve been written 2500 years ago!\n\nI count Colossal Cave as a qualified success\u2014as a tech demo and as a museum piece\u2014at a nascent stage of VR, in which qualified successes may be as good as it gets. I hope the Williams\u2019 continue to make classic-style adventure games and continue to elevate the genre.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":102065,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Colossal Cave 3D Review\u2014Exploring the Tomb of The Genre","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/10qgykq\/colossal_cave_3d_reviewexploring_the_tomb_of_the\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"xDreamTree","author_created_utc":1527950440,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_1htnwl0g","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1675014793,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10odqix","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10odqix","no_follow":false,"num_comments":10,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/10odqix\/pico_4_low_resolution_when_connected_to_pc\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676225994,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I recently bought a Pico 4 to test out because I\u2019m deciding if I should keep it or return it and get a valve index instead.

SteamVR performance test says my system goes above necessary requirements for most VR games (CPU: 5800x, GPU: 5600xt, 16GB RAM). My router is also pretty beefy as far as I know, it's an ASUS RT-AX58U. VD lists it as 1200mbps in the performance stats, and I set it to use 160mhz bandwidth on the 5ghz channel. It's in the same room as the rest of my setup, and only my headset + PC are using the 5GHz channel. PC is wired in via ethernet.\n\nSo when using VD it works flawlessly--way better experience than I had with Air Link, and worth the $20. About 20ms latency, perfect resolution. However as soon as I launch SteamVR the latency increases to around 40-50ms. Not awful but a sign of what's to come.\n\nAs soon as I launch ANY game, or even the Steam Home VR environment, latency jumps to anywhere between 100-400ms. This is obviously unusable and I become motion sick moments after it occurs. According to the VD performance overlay, this jump in latency is coming from the \"networking\" and \"encoding\" categories.\n\nI've already tried setting the graphics to the lowest settings and I've been keeping the VR bitrate at 10mbps while I try to figure it out. SteamVR resolution is set at 100%, it's not trying to boost it. Seems like the bottleneck is in my networking setup but again, I think my router is more than capable.\n\nIt's frustrating since it seems like I'm right on the edge of getting it to work.

I've obviously gone back to work, and do programming as a day job, but elements that should be 2d, like text, UI elements etc appear to be jumping out as 3d to me. It's as if my brain is trying to parse them as 3d object, similar to how objects appear in VR, because it's gotten used to how the world *should* look based on what it's seen in VR.\n\nIt's gotten to the point where even the text I'm typing out now sort of has that effect you get on holofoil trading cards, where you can see a small shift in perspective to give it the illusion of 3d. As I move my head, my brain is trying to simulate what it would be like to see \"around\" or \"behind\" the text. The problem is, this is happening on *everything.* And it's really making me feel quite ill and is giving me quite a spaced out feeling.\n\nEven some legitimate 3d objects in my room have this \"fake stereoscopic effect\" applied to it, on top of it's *actual 3D'ness.* Honestly, I haven't felt like this since my last acid trip...\n\nHas anyone experienced this before? lmao.

I want to know if there's a way to bump it to 144fps to match the Valve Index's refresh rate.\n\n**EDIT:** *SOLVED!* Found this little tool, [Indirect Display Driver Sample](https:\/\/github.com\/ge9\/IddSampleDriver).  \n\\---  \nSo I've recently gone down a little rabbit hole of wanting to play my usual flat screen games in a virtual environment. I started with Destiny 2 with my two monitors set up to be ultrawide in Nvidia-surround, and played through Virtual Desktop. It was honestly pretty great on my Index and I had a lot of fun with it. However it dawned upon me that I'm sort of doubling the amount of work that my graphics card has to do as the game is being rendered on both my dual screen desktop, and on both panels in the headset.\n\nSo I did a little digging and found this little thing called [AMYUNI](https:\/\/www.amyuni.com\/forum\/viewtopic.php?t=3030), ([video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ybHKFZjSkVY)) it allows you to create virtual, non mirrored monitors with a little bit of fiddling through command prompt, and if you decided to dive deeper, you can do some registry edits and set whatever resolution you want. So I did 7680 x 1440 *(which would be a triple monitor setup for me)* and the field of view I got was awesome. I could even disconnect my actual monitors and *just use* the one stupid-long virtual monitor if I wanted to. There's one thing though, the virtual monitors are locked in at 60fps, which is real noticeable with screens strapped to your face. Whenever I was using Nvidia-surround, I could get the full 144fps of the index, but now I'm stuck at 60 as the rate can't be changed in Windows Display Settings and Nvidia Control Panel won't detect the virtual monitor.\n\nSo I did even more digging and found this program called [CRU](https:\/\/www.monitortests.com\/forum\/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU), which is something that people use to get a little bit more frames out of their monitors *(which I didn't know was possible)* though sometimes at the expense of resolution. I felt like I was on the right track as the program detected the virtual monitor- however- I have no idea how to use the tool for this absurd situation I'm working with\/ around. And from what little I could figure out, it doesn't seem to like the settings I was going for.\n\nSo my question to whoever decided to read through this wall of text, is there a way to perhaps set a registry edit for the virtual monitor so I can set a 144fps rate that'll match the Index? or perhaps make Nvidia Control Panel detect the virtual monitor so it can be managed through it? Or *just Literally Anything?* I've been looking for a while now and I've hit the road block.\n\nOr is there an app that'll do all of this so I don't have to run command prompt every time?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":100452,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Need

for context, a few months ago my friend was hospitalized due to an auto accident. I visited him, bringing along my VR Quest 2 headset for him to kill time. He had to wear a neckwrap (not serious injury there) so he had a lot of fun watching movies with Bigcreen VR (theres a room where the screen is placed on the ceiling). Then I bought Skybox so that he can adjust the screen angle however he wanted.\n\nWhen he recovered later, he enjoyed YUKI a lot thanks to it being seated-friendly and almost no motion sickness. However, he still had to sit up a bit, or raised his head a bit to play the game properly.\n\nThis strucked me that there seems to be no game in Quest store that allow you to play while looking up just like Skybox (not sure about Steam games). Could this be a needed feature?\n\nIm a game developer mostly in mobile platform but over the years I have accumulated lots of 3d game assets. Back in 2016 I took part in a VR project in school, but then we quit halfway and released the game on Steam for free. From the technical point of view, it should not be hard to shift the entire perspective to your camera angle.

I played it through a cable on my Quest 2 and it was by far the best VR experience I've had. It wasn't perfect as there were a few things that made the game more annoying\/less fun but aside from that it was great.\n\nWhen I heard that they were going to create a sequel to Boneworks I was incredibly excited. From the trailers, you could tell that the base game would basically be the same which meant that they had time to focus on refining the experience. This was their chance to give us more awesome levels, fix some of the more annoying things(like melee) and just perfect the original formula. I also spent hours digging through all the lore to know what's happening in the story of the original game so I couldn't wait to see what happened to Ford. So I got on the hype train, constantly watching videos about Bonelab and how \"ITS GOING TO CHANGE VR!!!!\" but once I got the product myself, it was a complete letdown.\n\nThe breaking point that just soured the rest of my experience was when&gt;! I tried to solve the crane puzzle to get on with the story!&lt; but to my surprise, it had somehow inverted in on itself and was glitched. I tried to restart the level over and over and the game itself but it did not change anything. In fact it started to spazz all over the fucking level, glitching even worse. I usually don't have too much of a problem trying to troubleshoot errors to fix them in my games but when I pay 40 Euros, I expect it to not take hours of my time.\n\nI wanted to know if other people shared my opinion so I looked up discussions on the topic online and what surprised me was that people on youtube and even on subreddits STILL kept praising the game even though it has many glaring issues that make it a definite downgrade compared to Boneworks that you have to pay more money for. This thread is just me listing some of the issues I had with the game in order to help explain why you should not buy Bonelab at this moment:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The Loading Times**\n\nI can't be the only person who noticed a substantial increase in loading times. Now I will admit that I don't have the game installed on the fastest drive out there but I run every single other VR game off of this drive and it doesn't take any longer than a minute to get into the action(I'm counting both inital loading time + the one between menu and the game). In Bonelab however, the loading takes ages. I'm not joking when I say that it took me 5 entire minutes to get into game. And with the initial portion of the game having so many short levels, I can confidently say that 15-20% of my playtime was waiting for the levels to load. Boneworks loaded WAYY faster AND had longer levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **INSANE AMOUNTS OF CLUNKINESS IN EVERYTHING**\n\nBecause you have to control a full body character using just a headset and two controllers, you are not going to be able to do virtually any kind of movement without some kind of weird collision or just grabbing the wrong thing somehow.\n\nClimbing is horrendous because of this as sometimes your arms will just get stuck on something and hold you there until you figure out what part of your body is causing the issue.\n\nThe guns are also suffering from this as well. If you are just holding it like a default FPS character without doing anything cool then you won't have too much of a problem with it but you especially notice the jank when you try to aim around corners and etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Not even a modicum of an attempt to make the game more accessible.**\n\nI have only gotten sick once in a VR title which was when I tried to drive a car in VR chat. I've gotten sick multiple times in Bonelab already. There are no settings or anything to make the game more playable. Now this was the same in Boneworks but back then, you basically just played as Ford. You weren't really forced to do any crazy things so once you got used to the jumping and climbing and etc. you were fine.\n\nBut in Bonelab, there are soo many levels centered around gimmicks that make the game nigh unplayable. It feels like as though each developer worked on a single level all by themselves, with them centering the level around what they found cool, with the gimmick being dropped a minute later, never to be seen again. There doesn't seem to be any consistent plan\/idea of what exactly they want the game experience to be.\n\nThe game also doesn't even ATTEMPT to teach you how to play. I have experience from Boneworks that let me piece together how to do most things but I cannot imagine how annoying it must be to play Bonelab without knowing the series beforehand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Level Design is all over the place and the Campaign is wayyyyy too short**\n\n&gt;!When I got into the taxi I thought we were gonna travel to the \"real stages\" since I collected all the models and was now ready to fight the real fight but the game ended there. I've not felt more disappointed in a game I've been so excited for since you only got like 2-3 normal levels to play during the entire game so far. AND we didn't even get to know anything substantial about the lore that gave more context to Boneworks lore. Maybe there were more hidden lore things I missed since halfway through I was just pissed and wanted to get to the fun levels but man is this so annoying.!&lt;\n\nThe campaign is soo inconsistent in terms of what you are actually trying to get through. You get some levels where you can actually play the game and enjoy your time but there are so many more levels that are too gimmicky, too short or too pointless. &gt;!The model collection levels that you had to play started out fine when you could play as Strong or Heavy but aside from that, all of the rest completely sucked. The moon level was pointless, the pillar level is a war crime, the parkour level is annoying and the racing level was okay if not for the insane motion sickness.!&lt;\n\nTrying to parkour in this game is an absolute nightmare. Its REALLY HARD to be precise with your entire body as climbing is already fucked. The level design does not make it any easier on you either. Its like trying to play those annoying \"hard\" flash games where its basically just you dying 50 times in a row every time you have a new type of obstacle to get through\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Melee is horrible**\n\nThis isn't really too much of a surprise since it kinda sucked in Boneworks too but you'd think that they'd try to sit down and improve it at least slightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The best parts about this game are all things that Boneworks does better**\n\nAs it stands, there is virtually no reason to play Bonelab right now. Almost every single part of the game that is fun is that way because they copied Boneworks. Its like a CoD game being fun simply because they copy pasted the previous rendition which was also fun. Bonelab features a worse campaign, less mods, worse lore and more bugs. The only advantage it currently has is the music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **The game is rushed, incomplete and the mods are not here to save it yet**\n\nThis is the number one issue I have with the game as it just sums everything up perfectly. The game at its current state feels like an advertisement for what the game COULD BE once modders do their thing. It plays like a series of loosely connected tech demos that just show you the limits of the engine.\n\nNow once the Mods DO arrive, the experience might be far better as there will be more to do. Not to mention how a lot of the issues with the game will most likely be fixed somewhere down the line. I get that rushing out an incomplete, buggy piece of shit, scamming everyone using a hype train and then fixing the game to a playable state months after the fact is the \"meta\" for game publishing nowadays but its still annoying to be used as a guinea pig as the developers couldn't be bothered to playtest anything.\n\nMy only worry is that they don't give modders enough freedom as back in Boneworks, SL0 kinda made life difficult for them initially before \"embracing\" it. This would lead to the mods just being new guns\/models\/sandbox levels which is what we already have in Boneworks, without there being any great, level like experiences.\n\n**In conclusion, for anyone interested in buying the game, don't. Wait a couple of months for SL0 to patch the game together and for the modders to create content that the game lacks. After which, pick the game up in a sale at some point because the current price is NOT worth it.**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":96675,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Bonelabs

Games that are barely games, they aren't even to a standard to use them as an internal development pitch. \n\nYes I know VR is in early days, and people don't want to cripple any possible development that might lead to something, or at least thats the impression VR youtubers give me, because I haven't heard anyone say a single bad word about a single VR game, barring maybe walking dead onslaught, and I think thats because we already got walking dead saints and sinners before it. \n\nbut its becoming increasingly frustrating trying to find genuine reviews for games, everyone in the space is so insincerely positive its starting to feel like NFT bros or some shit, with ulterior motives. \n\nbut this is a problem for VR, if we can't sort the good from the bad, a kid with his 1-2 games a year might waste his money on an awful game, and never come back to VR, or VR developers aren't inclined to fix their game, and they move on to another project.\n\nLook I get it, I do, with VR we accept compromises thats the deal right, we get more immersion, we trade in good graphics, thats a given, we get smaller studios, less polish, and QA in VR must be a nightmare not just because the head sets are so different, but also because people (bad eyesight, short, tall, fat, fit, ect ect ect) are so different...i understand its not easy. \n\nI go into a VR game expecting to trade a lot of what I am used to in pancake games, for some better immersion so I don't mind.\n\nlet me give examples.\n\n* **Borderlands 2 VR**, ok, we won't get borderlands 2, there has to be cutbacks for VR, but it doesn't even have co-op which I'd say is a large % of what I'd get out of playing borderlands... but is the VR good enough to accept that tradeoff? No! the cinematics are cinema bench cut scenes, not immersive, the weapon controls are awful, you don't get the benefit of dual wielding it just doesn't feel like a very good VR game either but these guys are selling it for 50$ , the HUD IS off to the side, but if you turn your head to look at them, they move with it, they are impossible to look at. basic QA would resolve that.\n\n\n* **after the fall** I had high hopes for this, a 2nd generation VR game, the Devs made Arizona sunshine and while the game has flaws now, it was one of the first better VR games, you'd think they would have learned a lot in the last few years. but no, in fact all the same mistakes show up. the weapons and manual reloads are janky the accuracy to reload my gun VS. hand placement is so unforgiving, I can't reload my guns with index controllers, I physically can't get them close enough together. I still get pushed out of objects and away from things, when reaching for items, like an item on a table, reaching for it causes some collision pushback ...the physical player box  can't fit into very reasonable spaces (bathrooms on the first map come to mind) and this is also one of those games that onboards you for 30 mins before letting you even consider looking at some options (I hate snap turn) this is a game that also sells for 40$-50$ with a 5$ DLC it has nearly 1400 reviews, mostly positive. its not worth 10$ and even at 10$ i'd not recommend it to anyone. its been out 6 months so if they were going to fix the reloading issue, you'd expect that to be done by now.\n\n* **wardust** this is a 21$ game by a company thats already moved onto another janky unfinished project. nothing in this game worked. the UI was awful, the controls were awful, the functionality was awful, the bugs were awful. The AI was actually good, they could run&amp;gun, drive and fly pretty well. this game was unplayable, but has nearly 1400 mostly positive or very positive reviews on steam, the devs are already working on another project. I picked this up because a youtube reviewer sang its praise, while calling it \"janky\" it was implied comical physics, not unplayable unfinished game. \n\nThe information and resources out there for people to buy games for VR are badly lacking, and its why shitty erotic VR games populate the \"popular &amp; upcoming\" lists for VR on steam\n\nFor context, into the radius, a game I'd say is top 5 all time, up there with HL:alyx, boneworks and walking dead saint and sinners...has like 4k reviews, positive and overwhelmingly positive...even if you don't like into the radius, to does exactly what it sets out to do, and well, everything works as intended. but going by \"overwhelmingly positive\" that and wardust are indistinguishable  \n\nso my point is, even if you stop playing a game, because its functionally broken, please review the game indicating as such, I know I have been closing games, and never playing them again or thinking about them, and its a disservice to everyone else out there.  \n\nI have over 100 VR games with 20 installed, and the ones I don't play are for very good reasons, so I have some work to do about catching up on my reviews for all of those games, I think the VR community deserves that much.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":92441,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Request to everyone reading this, review your games on steam, even if you only played for 3mins and the controls were bad so you quit, let everyone know.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.94,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/vwvqxb\/request_to_everyone_reading_this_review_your\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"30DayFreeTrial_","author_created_utc":1623374416,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_cnhd5yr6","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1656476357,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vn6rkz","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vn6rkz","no_follow":false,"num_comments":37,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/vn6rkz\/stuck_between_two_optionsi_would_appreciate_your\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657079792,"retrieved_utc":1657079792,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"\nFor A graduation gift, I have always wanted to have a VR Headset.

Do the controllers use charging and batteries, or just batteries?\n6. If I were to take my PC to family gatherings to play custom beat saber, would it just be easier to buy it for the quest?\n7.

again for more Steam Next Fest mini-reviews of every VR game listed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are my own personal review of the available demos and unless I tell you to definitely avoid it, I suggest checking them out for yourself and judge your own opinion if you find my comments too harsh, which I can be if the game is lazy and\/or insulting badly designed (even for a WIP demo) and might not have much to say if its that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games are rated 0-5, with 5 being amazing quality.  I understand these are not AAA quality games and as they are demos there be bugs and missing features, so they are rated depending on the potential on the idea (and bonus points for originality), how much effort is put into its graphics and gameplay and the content and easy access of the demo's features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games will be tested with a Valve Index and RTX 3080 GPU.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm very disappointed how many demos are unplayable this time, from broken controls to until to get even started.  If I had to guess, many of these would be made to work for the Quest 2, so the Index controls would not be as responsive, but this didn't affect nearly as much experiences as it did in the past compared to this time around.  There are a few more games needed to be added to the list (more keep being added as well) but they are currently downloading as the list was the biggest this time around, but sadly most disappointing (no 4.5+ or higher this time around).  Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.  This does not work correctly for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down Fast VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1956860\/Down_Fast_VR\/\n\nThis bicycle game keeps drifting me to the left-side, no button seems to work (and it's not my controllers).  I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.  I am unable to get started in this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRANDMA**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1727550\/GRANDMA\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?).  Not sure If I wanted to play this one anyway from that cover\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hyperstacks**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1046760\/Hyperstacks\/\n\nI can't get the dash to work with the Index Controllers (little mini-jumps) and can't complete the tutorial.  It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like

question - Does a better graphics card help with the \u201cfuzz\u201d and motion blur I experience with my current laptop, or is it just an improvement for frame rate and graphics? \n\n\u2026 I know I know: \u201cbuy the best graphics card you can afford\u201d\u2026 but as someone who\u2019s never been a PC gamer, it\u2019s hard to know which areas become improved by better cards.\n\nI\u2019ve been a PS4\/5 gamer (at least when I\u2019ve had the limited time away from my corporate life and family responsibilities) - but I recently tried VR and was blown the fuck away\u2026. I just find it fascinating, and my wife actually enjoys some of the games which has lead to some good bonding that I want to nurture (especially since I get to actually play games more often now!)\n\nHowever until now, I\u2019ve only been playing on a laptop on my vive pro 2\u2026 which works fine and I don\u2019t notice stuttering very often (even in Half Life Alyx) but the image quality is often has some strong motion blur or just \u201cfuzzy\u201d edges to things like letters or other areas of fine detail in the game.\n\nMy business no longer needs one of its old 3D rendering machines, so I was excited to take it home and fire up some VR games on it (hoping to get a better experience and finally add the wireless adapter to my vive pro 2)\u2026 However the card is too old\/weak and is a way worse experience than my laptop.  I\u2019m toying with buying a new card, but it\u2019s really hard to know where the line is between a solid upgrade and a waste of money.\n\nI\u2019m mostly interested in image quality and reduced motion blur - but specifically I\u2019m looking for reducing the \u201cfuzzy\u201d details around stuff like text.  Today I have to often squint or readjust my headset to get stuff into better focus which can take me out of the immersion.\n\nDoes anyone have any explanation of \u201cwhat\u201d specifically improves with your experience when using a better card? \u2026 and where do diminishing returns start to kick in? \u2026. I suspect it\u2019s a hard question to answer since I haven\u2019t found clear details already, but really appreciate any answers!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":88150,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How much of a difference does a good graphics card really make?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.25,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/sw1kkb\/how_much_of_a_difference_does_a_good_graphics\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"StankyPete9","author_created_utc":1613418035,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_adptu6ju","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1642793845,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"s9ixk8","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_s9ixk8","no_follow":false,"num_comments":139,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/s9ixk8\/let_help_out_the_new_guys_whats_your_favorite_vr\/","pinned":false,"poll_data":{"is_prediction":false,"options":[{"id":"13331408","text":"Boneworks","vote_count":312},{"id":"13331409","text":"Half-Life: Alyx","vote_count":927},{"id":"13331410","text":"Pavlov\/Onward\/Zero Caliber","vote_count":283},{"id":"13331411","text":"Arizona Sunshine\/After The Fall","vote_count":49},{"id":"13331412","text":"Blade &amp; Sorcery\/Hellsplit Arena\/Gorn","vote_count":379},{"id":"13331413","text":"Show Results\/Other (Comment)","vote_count":503}],"prediction_status":null,"resolved_option_id":null,"total_stake_amount":null,"total_vote_count":2453,"tournament_id":null,"user_selection":null,"user_won_amount":null,"vote_updates_remained":null,"voting_end_timestamp":1643053045230},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654161185,"retrieved_utc":1654161185,"score":78,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"\"This community requires body text\"\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/s9ixk8)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":88169,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Let help out the new guys!

So, I have a 16\u201d MacBook Pro with the M1 Max processor and 32gb of RAM, which I know is overkill in most cases for my situation, but with higher bit rates for recording along with the plugins made it a worthwhile investment for me.  \n\nAnyway, I love Skyrim and play primarily on Xbox, but have started taking interest in VR as of late. For the most part, I have been holding off on VR until the technology and other peripherals get developed further, but found the [KatVR Omni-Directional Treadmill](https:\/\/youtu.be\/l1zuLwLLHY0) to be very intriguing. So I\u2019ve been dabbling with the possibility of pursuing this a bit more over the last few weeks.  \n\nFast forward to today and my company is giving me an Occulus Quest 2 for testing use cases in business environments. Freaking crazy, I know! I\u2019m also free to try it out for personal use and provide feedback. (For context, I work for a company that partnered on some of the development, which I assume is ongoing.) So, I am exploring the possibility of using Parallels to run Windows 11 and SteamVR for Skyrim. And strongly considering the KatVR, but also very interested in some of the [bHaptic](https:\/\/www.bhaptics.com) offerings (gloves and vest are particularly intriguing).  \n\nSo my question is this: do you think the specs of my computer can handle all that? Are there different approaches that might be more power efficient? Are there any peripherals that you think aren\u2019t yet worth the price that I should cut out? Should I just bite the bullet and get a separate, dedicated PC?  \n\n***Edit: I really meant Windows 10 or 11.

It blows my mind that I haven't seen anyone else talking about Battle Group VR. This is something I would have expected to be touted as a system seller.\n\nI'm not sure why there isn't more buzz about this game, given how feature complete, enjoyable, and innovative it is. There is a full game here. It would be a solid and innovative game even without the VR features. This isn't just another VR tech demo built around one of those low-hanging fruit concepts. It has a very good single-player campaign, and several forms of multiplayer (some of which are very innovative). Conquest mode in particular is almost a grand-strategy gamer's dream; providing long-term campaign context for all the great tactical gameplay you'll be doing. Nearly everything about it feels polished; but I'd like to call particular attention to the user interface and control designs. Nearly every piece of information you need to make decisions is easily at hand or can be discovered via a glance or quick and easy manipulation of the battlefield map. The controls are intuitive and flexible; nearly every menu item can be repositioned for preference.\n\nI mean, I only recently discovered Star Trek Bridge Commander on GOG when it released last month, but I've been a fan of the genre since playing Artemis Bridge Simulator 10 years ago. This game really feels like a new addition to that family. Right up there with Bridge Crew, Pulsar: Lost Colony, and Carrier Command 2. I'm not sure how new the voice command feature is, but this game controls completely like you are the captain on the bridge of your flagship coordinating the movement of your fleet. You just need to learn a few basic syntax commands, and gone is the micromanaging and fumbling with menus\/submenus\/and directing the individual movements of every unit. This game vastly improves on space combat compared to games mentioned above, and other games like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident, Stellaris, Homeworld (which does have a better setting\/mission structure), Starsector\/Starfarer, and the Battlefleet Gothic series.\n\nI wonder if people are scared away from it because it bills itself as an RTS? The speed of combat has actually been quite manageable. The engagement distances, ship\/projectile speeds, and reaction times required to respond to shield failures and critical hull damage are very manageable even without any familiarity with the game or controls in-particular. I haven't found the need to pause like I normally do in games like the Total-War series even.\n\nThe developer is even still updating the game and adding features and polish.\n\nIf you have even a passing interest in strategy games, star trek\/BGS, or being a space ship captain, I would heartily recommend you try out this game.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":89813,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Why isn't Battle Group VR on This Subreddit Every Month?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/q46if0\/why_isnt_battle_group_vr_on_this_subreddit_every\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"SpaceSloth707","author_created_utc":1555753602,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3mlkcoo2","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1633021414,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"pyo2x4","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_pyo2x4","no_follow":true,"num_comments":10,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/pyo2x4\/quest_2_vs_reverb_g2\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656138423,"retrieved_utc":1656138423,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey all!\n\nSo I'm really interested in getting a VR headset that I can use on PC. Since I've recently got myself a powerful pc that should be more than capable of handling VR. (my PC has an AMD Ryzen 7 &amp; RTX 3060 Ti) I've had my taste of VR already, with the PSVR. But I kinda want something for my PC as well, an upgrade basically. I've got my sights on either the Reverb G2 or the Quest 2. But I find it very hard to choose one since I found out that both have pros and cons. I figured that posting here would hopefully help me make a good decision. I really like that the Reverb G2 has pretty good screens. Apparently it's also more comfortable to wear than the Quest 2. However, the Quest 2 apparently has better tracing, especially better controllers. Plus you have a nice bonus that it also works as a standalone headset. This makes it hard for me to choose. I really want a headset that has good screens, because on PSVR you can see the pixels of the screen, especially if you play a game and look at something in the distance. That's when I notice the screen's pixels of the PSVR the most. Otherwise I don't notice it as much. Oh, and of course when I'm reading text. So as I've said, I prefer good screen quality, but if the tracking and\/or the controllers aren't as good, it kinda ruins the experience. Wear comfort is also another important factor for me, besides screen quality.\n\n(ps, The valve index is a bit too expensive for my liking, which is why I'm interested in the Reverb G2 and Quest 2)\n\nIf you can help me by giving tips, suggestions and so on, that would be much appreciated!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":89822,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"quest 2 vs reverb g2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/pyo2x4\/quest_2_vs_reverb_g2\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"omqitz_trent","author_created_utc":1565826703,"author_flair_background_color":"#0079d3","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"8fdb706a-e173-11ea-a80a-0e4f31bd5b41","author_flair_text":"Oculus Quest","author_flair_text_color":"light","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_sxozbrq","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1631468827,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":1631470364.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"pmxesp","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_pmxesp","no_follow":false,"num_comments":14,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/pmxesp\/what_should_i_do_with_my_psvr_i_rarely_ever_use_it\/","pinned":false,"poll_data":{"is_prediction":false,"options":[{"id":"10454990","text":"Keep it","vote_count":48},{"id":"10454991","text":"Sell it","vote_count":144},{"id":"10454992","text":"Results","vote_count":59}],"prediction_status":null,"resolved_option_id":null,"total_stake_amount":null,"total_vote_count":251,"tournament_id":null,"user_selection":null,"user_won_amount":null,"vote_updates_remained":null,"voting_end_timestamp":1631641627882},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656156211,"retrieved_utc":1656156211,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"For more context I have a quest 1 now.

long wanted to have my own VR setup since I first tried out a Virtual Reality gaming demo in New York while visiting several years ago. \n\nI will soon be moving into my first apartment and thought I'd pair my gaming rig (1080TI, Intel i7 8700k) with a VR setup in my living room.\n\nFor context the last time I gamed on a VR Headset was with the original HTV Vive and I remember being blown away by it. It seems VR has matured a lot more since and I'm excited to jump into it today. \n\nMy budget isn't a particular issue, my biggest needs are the following:\n\n  * Visual Quality\n  * Tracking\n  * Comfort \n\nI've been doing my research and I believe the Valve Index, HP G2 Reverb, and HTC Vive Pro 2 are all great options. Valve Index seems a bit lacking in resolution from what I understand but I know the HP G2 Reverb can be paired with the superior Valve index controllers for excellent tracking and visual quality, however I heard this \"Frankenstein\" approach is a bit unstable and leads to unsupported games or many little annoyances. The Vive Pro 2 seems to pick the best out of both worlds a bit with builtin support for Valve index tracking and excellent visual quality. My concern is that there is a significant \"god ray\" effect on the Vive Pro 2. Is the lens issue really as bad as people make it out to be? Given my last experience was with the original HTC vive  will this glaring effect really be an issue for me? \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

But nearly 10 years have passed in the world of VR and I still cannot enjoy the experience of a slow paced true mil style CQB\/Stealth based game, games such as Pavlov, Onward and Contractors have the perfect canvas for a true Mil Style CQB game however no one seems to even see this side of VR in my eyes.\n\nContractors has such an amazing clean feel to it I could spend days in there, however it seems the devs just abandoned it with no custom game modes, on that subject I would love it if these developers could maybe incorporate maybe a mission creator where you could have a UI of the map, place where you'd want hostages, attackers, evac lz etc but that's not my main focus!\n\nMaybe devs are just waiting for the point VR is widely used and in the majority of peoples homes, or until VR is more widely optimised and less intense to build a game around idk, I just hope at some point my dream VR game arrives haha\n\nContext: Vive, Vive Pro and Index owner.
