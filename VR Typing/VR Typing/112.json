But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.

But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Towers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You&amp;#39;re always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that&amp;#39;s religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn&amp;#39;t even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It&amp;#39;s intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it&amp;#39;s best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it&amp;#39;s an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren&amp;#39;t wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it&amp;#39;s certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it&amp;#39;s just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn&amp;#39;t help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you&amp;#39;re looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3a0bd6a8095801405d5ed95ec208213cfb3518f3","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246118633e6653f0db20e00beb06223b9cc3906e","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0508d4bc30738f86601aee90ddf6332c8ef1296","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e6070b955d44fe81246bfebe72c5203d2e188e6","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"ufpSs57_l5cXn1luM5M6K0sTI67MB3qDxAF5TI26_6g"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c0266eea-07f8-11e6-bd33-0ebd65f9ef9d","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","id":"18suonc","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"bmack083","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/18suonc\/towers_and_powers_review\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/18suonc\/towers_and_powers_review\/","subreddit_subscribers":116566,"created_utc":1703772354.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"I currently own a very much broken quest 2 and a launch day quest 3 and i want to play pcvr.

I also own a pair of xreal air pro 2s (the original nreal air before that) that I control with a smart ring, and have done extensive testing with the vitures and their neckband along with ive done extensive testing with the xreal beam. \n\nWhile the beam and the viture neckband both did a great job of enabling spatial computing and window pinning a lot of the experience for me was ruined by the connection of dongles I had to have to get everything working and there was no easy gesture control. The default interface for a lot of it also just seemed worse than Dex plugged directly into the glasses from my phone. Neither of these glasses are really advertised for spatial computing and I got that they weren't designed for use specifically with Dex, so enter the quest 3.\n\nBeen playing some phasmophobia using my glasses with a buddy and decided fuck it, I've got a game to play, can try out this spatial computing in the mean time, let's see what the quest is like when used as more than a party trick, surely VR has come a long way in the nearly decade since the PSVR released. Went through the hou r long setup process and the entire time was just constantly getting annoyed with little software issues. Finally all setup and ready to just boot up some Netflix in a floating window and do some chores while having the TV completely out of the way instead of pip like I've done with my xreals literally hundreds of times and it's now even easier with the pro2s complete transparency mode.\n\nWow, just all I have to say is wow. After the heavy advertising and all of the articles I've read talking about how great this feature was for getting chores done, I can not say I was expecting this. Like who in their right mind decided to use the same lenses that 2003 digital cameras used? I understand budget cuts to keep the price of the headset low, but this is just embarrassingly bad quality, I can't even read a text message on my phone without taking the headset off. Then don't even get me started on the typing experience, I never expected to be slower at typing when I could use all 10 fingers for alleged full 3d bone tracking than when using one finger to use control a single mouse and using gesture typing, but somehow Zuck did it and managed to make even the window management with hand tracking just as bad. It honestly ended up being a worse experience than Dex plugged directly into the xreal glasses, let alone the vitures that don't even need the neckband to pin a screen. \n\nOkay, okay, I thought, this is primarily a gaming headset, let me use it for that. So I connect it to my steam via steam link and boot up phasmo and I'm just amazed again at how little the technology has evolved in the nearly decade since the PSVR released. Okay, yes it's inside it tracking and wireless, but none of that is exactly be technology either. Steam link\/moonlight\/remote play, plenty of ways to do this type of thing for years. I mean hell back when destiny first launched I was able to do my dailies off my cell phone in my biochem lecture hall and even before that, my first time playing Arkham City when it launched was via a streaming service.\n\nBut here's the big problem with VR gaming imo and why it hasn't caught on, and imo probably never will, at least not in it's current form. The controllers. VR gaming and gamers are so OBSESSED with showing off the immersion of the technology that it absolutely ruins games. The VR controllers are so limited because \"why would you press Y to change your gun when you can just reach over your shoulder or grab your pistol from your hip\" simple because I don't fucking want to do that, I want to sit back, relax, and play some video games.\n\nThis is something I noticed back on the PSVR, while yeah getting to play Skyrim in VR was fun for a bit, I quickly grew tired of playing it the \"VR way\" but luckily there was a native control scheme and I could just use my ds4 and head and it was a great experience, because I could still relax and play games, but also feel like I was completely a part of the world. And then there was far point, which to this day, is the best example of what VR gaming can and should be. It came with it's own controller,b loosely shaped after a rifle, but most importantly, it has every button a normal controller would have, which meant I was not limited in how I played the game. I could easily play the game on 100% immersion mode where I was standing and basically only used the the trigger and directional stick as inputs or I could just as easily lay back on the couch and play the game like I would halo, just with the added bonus of hey I can turn my head to look around.\n\nThe quest controllers can never do something like this though, because even though there's the huge space on top where both a standard d-pad and even a stream deck sized track pad could easily fit, especially if you have abxy all on the right controller, we're instead limited. This isn't too mention the paddles that could easily be added to the controller. I mean honestly not entirely sure why there is a thumbstick for looking around, the one thing VR does incredibly well, but there's not a dpad. \n\nImo videogames are something that most people do to relax, but VR seems to strive to make it impossible to relax while gaming, it wants to force you to be up and moving while you're playing. The xreals do a great job of immersing me in the game already and yeah there are plenty of times where I want to get up and more into the game, but that is decidedly not the mood I was in when I started gaming, the game was just that good that it made me want to do more. VR gaming just doesn't offer that opportunity to start out with a relaxed session and hype up into an immersive session, so to me it remains a part trick. \n\nI've had headset for about a month now and there's been a couple times where I've been playing a regular game and it's hyped up into wanting to transition to a VR game, but then I didn't feel like dealing with the headset and piss poor paasthrough mode. \n\nSo my question VR gamers of Reddit, are there any games that allow you to relax and game? Because thus far everything I've tried I just think to myself \"what a great party trick,\" everything but the passthrough mode, that's just a terrible feature IMO, I tried washing dishes with it on and had to completely redo them after because the cameras just straight blurred out how dirty they remained","author_fullname":"t2_2wnwjq4f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Someone convince me not to return the Quest 3","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18qzx0m","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703565726.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t my first time using VR, long ago I had the og psvr, but I&amp;#39;ve always primarily been a PC gamer and have followed the development of VR pretty closely since (mostly been waiting on a decent standalone oled headset), as well as I&amp;#39;ve tried out some friends quest 2s.

So like a natural kid would do, i obviously copied the habits of the popular kids.\n\ni took a long  1 year break at just 10 years old. in 2021 i discovered the world of VR which lead me to find games like Beatsaber, Blade &amp; Sorcery etc. i started to notice on the gaming trending page, some of the videos contained vr in it so i started digging until i eventually found myself with a game called Gorilla Tag. i filmed my first ever Gorilla tag video in December of 2021. I went super viral, my video blew up on both tiktok and youtube and then my tiktok career skyrocketed, leaving the youtube side at rock bottom. I eventually found ways of making good content for 10 yr olds to enjoy and get views.\n\nuntil i got banned from the game and i made another youtube video explaining why i got banned (which that video was only posted on youtube) and it barely broke 1k views. (video was uploaded august of 2022)\n\nat the time of recording that video since i knew that i was once famous before i thought i would become famous from that video once again but, it was the opposite. My youtube Subscriber count went from 3k down to 100 subscribers. All because of some simple mistake i made by typing KKK in the room code. (at the time i did not know what KKK meant)\n\nafter the video i took a super long break that lasted 7 long months, during the process i went through puberty and my voiced changed that my viewers thought another person was managing the channel after uploading a comeback video. that video barely blew up and it hit barely 100 views.\n\nsince then i've been uploading not that many videos and my upload schedule is messed up. i upload every month, and know im worried because i faced some backlash over swears on my videos leading to making my content family friendly. I'm afraid that my youtube account will be forgotten since i don't upload that much anymore.\n\nI instead focus on my mental health and physical health, during this youtube thing my health was at its worst (2021) from suffering bullying at school and a bunch of stuff.\n\nfeel free to comment on this.","author_fullname":"t2_kz2rt1u7g","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Once a Famous youtuber\/tiktoker ask me anything.","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18ii7ft","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1702586661.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started my youtube career at just 8 years old. i quickly realized my parents did not like my at home behaviour, so i stopped doing content at 9, youtube content creators at my school where getting popular over Gaming.

I went super viral, my video blew up on both tiktok and youtube and then my tiktok career skyrocketed, leaving the youtube side at rock bottom. I eventually found ways of making good content for 10 yr olds to enjoy and get views.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;until i got banned from the game and i made another youtube video explaining why i got banned (which that video was only posted on youtube) and it barely broke 1k views.

a look at my Unreal Engine VR Flight Sim Project (PCVR on QUEST2 running low spec hardware), I need some feedbacks!\n\nWhat do you think about it? I've been working for almost 3 months now trying to carve out as much time as possible, I'm not an expert but I work as a developer full time, so I haven't had too many difficulties in getting started. In the video we have the internal view of a Lockheed F80C Shooting Star, I am not aiming for a graphic or tactical replica (No Radar\/Fox3\/Guided Missiles on the real aircraft) but everything will be concentrated on the physics and flight envelope of each aircraft.\n\nAt this early stage I also tried to use the thrust parameters of a J79 Jet Engine instead of the original (J33), thus giving the aircraft exceptional maneuverability and thrust.

Superhot \u2013 awesome but short\n\n2. Beat Saber \u2013 awesome but fuck microtransactions\n\n3. Robo recall \u2013 awesome. Weird how this is still arguably one of the best arcade VRs with it being first wave game.\n\n4. Until you fall \u2013 the only other game besides Asgard\u2019s wrath which does great melee combat\n\n5. Racket: Nx \u2013 while not as good as the other games here, I felt B wouldn\u2019t do it justice. Best game for anger management \ud83d\ude0a\n\nB Tier: (things you should play if you find appealing)\n\n1. Unspoken 6 7 9 1. I really like the concept of casting spells with gestures and I\u2019m sad it\u2019s underused in VR.\n\n2. The Wizards Enhanced Edition 5 6 9 0 I really love dr. strange spell casting in VR. \n\n3. The Wizards \u2013 Dark Times 6 8 9 1 B+ It\u2019s the best of its kind (gesture spell casting campaign). Very GPU demanding. UE has so much potential for VR. Gameplay is awesome and environment and lighting are cool.\n\n4. From other suns \\~ 8 8 0 I love the genre and I played with online friends at the time, so I enjoyed it a lot. Not sure how it aged\n\n5. Layers of Fear 9 8 6 4. Great story, and VR adds a lot to the immersion. Poor port though\n\n6. Sairento VR 6 6 9 1. I think it\u2019s great as an arcade game, but it has a campaign with a story technically. I had great fun for 5 hours then had enough.\n\n7. The Invisible Hours 8 9 7 1 good story and excellent storytelling mechanics\n\n8. Star Wars Squadrons 7 7 8 1 Flying a spaceship in VR is awesome. I just don\u2019t love star wars too much. And gameplay isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n9. No man\u2019s sky VR 7 9 7 0 The only game that was ported to VR and you can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s better VR than most non-ports. Exploration and flight in VR is amazing, but when I last played the story and quest were just fetchy and buildy. I got bored before I finished it (After 100 hours though)\n\n10. Stormland 6 7 8 3 arguably C tier with valve index headache\n\n11. Eagle flight 4 7 8 1 I had a really good time with it.\n\n12. Borderlands 2 VR 7 8 9 1 This Isn\u2019t the best port, but in retrospect I had great fun playing this game. My biggest issue is the poor balance for single player. They did give all the DLC for free. So good guy devs.\n\n13. Windlands 2 - 2 7 7 1 very fun&amp;smooth platformer with simplistic graphics and bow battles. Bosses are fun, but general enemies are boring.\n\n14. Transpose \\~ 7 7 1 Good Puzzle game.\n\n15. Doom VFR 4 5 8 2 maybe a B-. I had good time.\n\n16. Risk of Rain 2 \u2013 4 7 7 3 the mod works well for most characters! But I did not play it much because I already overplayed it pancake\n\n17. The Room VR 6 9 6 0 \u2013 too good for a B, but not good enough for an A. good puzzle game with nice atmosphere\n\n18. Vertigo Remastered 6 7 7 0 \u2013 an incredibly polished game considering one person made it. Kinda half-life-ish, but blander and generally not as interesting.\n\n19. Westworld: Awakenings 8 6 6 0 \u2013 the most expansive advertisement ever. Don\u2019t buy at full price. Very good acting and facial animations and a nice story are lowered down by meh gameplay. I suggest playing on easy and focus on enjoying the enjoyable parts\n\n20. Down the Rabbit hole 6 6 5 1 \u2013 Good game for kids (7-11). Cool use of perspective.\n\n21. A fisherman\u2019s tale 6 7 6 1 \u2013 another cool little puzzle story game with nice use of perspective.\n\n22. Pixel Ripped 1989\/1995 \u2013 I stopped playing both games after trying them for 30 min. I thought \u201cwow this is cool\u201d and quickly I was really bored. I\u2019d put them in C but they are way too good for C on the objective levels.\n\n23. Maskmaker 7 8 6 0 \u2013 one of the best indie walking simulators with out there. Biggest issues was puzzles were too light.\n\n24. Phantom Covert Ops 6 7 8 0 \u2013 an AAA game trying to do something unique VR-wise and does it with good polish. I hope to see a sequel with richer game. it\u2019s my favorite of the grey games I\u2019ve tried.\n\n25. Karnage Chronicles 6 7 8 2 \u2013 If you played asgard\u2019s wrath this is pretty good with gameplay and visuals but far from as good. It has a fully functional co-op, but annoying voice chat.\n\n26. Song in the Smoke \u2013 5 7 6 1. It\u2019s a solid survival game I\u2019m just not that much into that. Not much story. Exploration is fun. I dislike repetitive survival grind. Combat isn\u2019t good so it doesn\u2019t justify it. Probably subjectively C now that I think about it.\n\n27. Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife \u2013 5 7 4 2. This is a C game but I have a soft spot for WoD. Why is the franchise cursed \u2639? Good sound design and some nice exploration. OK plot. Some frustrating stealth. Cool enemies.\n\n28. Eternal Starlight \u2013 3 6 8 3 A space fleet real-time w\/ pause rogue like. Awesome concept. I wish this was AAA so it would be an A game. Barebones story like FTL. Cool weapon and encounter diversity. Mostly I just love the fantasy of being a space fleet captain.\n\n29. The Great C 8 - - 0 it\u2019s a 35 min VR movie, and while it\u2019s not great enough to be A, it is the best of its kind so it gets A-\n\n30. Form \u2013 5 8 7 0 One of the best games to introduce someone new to VR. Intuitive and pretty. Very short.\n\n31. Fracked \u2013 3 5 7 1 \u2013 a solid action adventure with climbing and shooting and skiing. Nice all-rounder.\n\n32. Last Labyrinth 7 7 7 3 \u2013 Very good minimalistic storytelling and puzzles. Super annoying to 100%. Very dark - not for most ppl!\n\nShort experiences: I rate these B because they do not overstay their welcome. Just short and fun.\n\n1. Crow the legend\n\n2. Wolves in the Walls\n\n3. Henry\n\n4. Mission ISS\n\n5. Ghost in the shell. Nice Ad\n\n6. Lost\n\n7. Curious tale of the stolen pets\n\n8. The lab\n\n9. Ayahuasca \u2013 this is very trippy, be warned\n\n10. Firebird - La Peri\n\nB Tier Arcade:\n\n1. Boneworks 4 6 8 1. It\u2019s a tech demo. I had fun and it\u2019s smooth, but nothing amazing. Nice valve-ish humor at time.\n\n2. Guided meditation VR \u2013 This can be excellent depending on the person using it.\n\n3. Echo combat\/arena \u2013 not sure if there are players\n\n4. Google Earth VR\n\n5. Medium \u2013 this is essentially paint in VR\n\n6. Tetris effect \u2013 It\u2019s the best TETRIS game ever made!\n\n7. Thumper\n\n8. BOX VR\/Audica\/Pistol Whip\/OhShape \u2013 if you really get into beat saber there\u2019s plenty of good quality similar things to diversify.\n\n9. Gun Club VR \u2013 it\u2019s something between a tech demo and a museum shooting range. Very \u2018Merica. It\u2019s well made for what it is.\n\n10. Vermilion \u2013 It\u2019s just a paint simulator. If you like chilling and painting.\n\n11. Kayak: Mirage \u2013 Quite Good kayak racing, but what it\u2019s really for is using \u201ctour\u201d option and going on spinning wheels irl!\n\nC Tier and C Tier Arcade (games I feel bad paying for)\n\n1. Wilson\u2019s heart I feel like this game would have been good if I enjoyed the story. But it was meh to me.\n\n2. Raw data \u2013 a first wave VR wave shooter. Looks great, but didn\u2019t age well\n\n3. Spice and Wolf VR 1\/2 \u2013 I love spice and wolf, but both the games were very shallow compared to the anime\n\n4. The climb \u2013 it was great then, it didn\u2019t age well. I hope this game\u2019s mechanics will be a small part of another game one day.\n\n5. Arizona Sunshine \u2013 didn\u2019t age well generic zombie shooter.\n\n6. Walking dead Saints and sinners \u2013 I found this game quite boring. Boring survival. Boring plot. Meh combat. But it is well reviewed.\n\n7. Gorn \u2013 It\u2019s fun for the gimmick but grows boring very fast.\n\n8. In Death \u2013 I got bored fast. Maybe too fast to rate it.\n\n9. Space pirate trainer \u2013 Good introductory VR game\n\n10. Apex Construct \u2013 cool bow. But just play skyrim instead. (much cooler bow)\n\n11. Budget cuts \u2013 awesome 1 trick game (teleportation mechanic is really cool). Maybe it should be a B tier. I just completely forgot about it so it\u2019s probs a C\n\n12. Serious Sam VR. All of them.\n\n13. Espire 1 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why this game wasn\u2019t fun. But it wasn\u2019t. they did a lot great. :S \n\n14. Edge of nowhere \u2013 meh and a little puke\n\n15. Hellblade VR \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent game. But it doesn\u2019t gain anything from VR, except in the dark scene.\n\n16. Windlands \u2013 it\u2019s a nice relaxing spiderman simulator on easy with nice music. Prob had worse experience than most because valve index acceleration issue.\n\n17. Lies Beneath \u2013 It\u2019s a good horror game, if you expect a game that is adapted for mobile graphics and performance. I refunded it after an hour and a half also because I had stuff I wanted to play more. simplified graphics\/experience aside, this is at least a B\n\n18. Carly and the reaperman \u2013 it might be fun as a bonding experience with a kid or something. Was not having fun, but maybe because it wasn\u2019t for me. (possibly clouded judgement because I played as the boring side on flatscreen)\n\n19. Cosmodread \u2013 I\u2019m usually into horror and rogue-likes but it just didn\u2019t click with me. I stopped early, so I may have misjudged it. I think I have a bias against overly gray games, like espire.\n\n20. Elven Assassin \u2013 It\u2019s pretty basic but I had fun. Better with friends.\n\n21. Gnomes &amp; Goblins \u2013 It has pretty good visual design. 1 hour campaign, and some sandbox-ish exploration. If it was 5$ it\u2019s be B.\n\n22. Luna \u2013 I found the gameplay tedious which lowered the enjoyment to C from B\u2026 stopped in the middle. Cute story and art though.\n\n23. Creed Rise to Glory \u2013 Meh. But I suppose if you really specifically want to box in a ring it\u2019s solid.\n\n24. Rush \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to properly rate, but it\u2019s similar to eagle flight, and has a good amount of diversity, even though I preferred eagle flight\u2019s take on it. Might be a B tier.\n\n25. A Chair in a Room Greenwater \u2013 I really liked it but I had a save file issue and had to watch half the game on youtube\n\n26. Vanishing Realms \u2013 Aged poorly\n\n27. Hellsplit: arena \u2013 arena games are just lazy (some games even have them as an extra something to do), and the combat is just ok.\n\n28. Surv1V3 \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to have a solid opinion but it was pretty boring to play solo while I did.\n\n29. Mare \u2013 A relaxing game about a bird guiding an orphaned girl through a post-apocalyptic zone. Sounds like an A, but quest graphics, easy puzzles, and underwhelming plot make it very underwhelming.\n\n30. Deisim \u2013 If you like games like stacklands this\u2019ll be a B tier for you. Simple god management game with simple graphics. I hope someone makes a god simulator RPG with cool branching narratives some day it\u2019ll be A for me.\n\n31. Ironlights \u2013 I expected to love it when I started\u2026 I hate weapon delay that\u2019s meant to simulate weight. It keeps breaking immersion. Mixing Until you fall with wobbly Gorn sounds great but doesn\u2019t work for me. I recognize there\u2019s a lot of polish in it though.\n\n32. Cooking Simulator VR \u2013 For me this type of gaming is only fun when it\u2019s a mini game inside another RPG. Seems really polished, but not for me.\n\n33. Final Assault \u2013 I barely played it because I wasn\u2019t into it so it might be a B game. I\u2019m more of an eternal starlight guy\n\n34. Warplanes WW1 fighters \u2013 After MSFS and SW: Squadrons this just felt underwhelming. Haven\u2019t played much.\n\n35. Warplanes Battles over \u2013 Same as above.\n\n36. Ultrawings 2 \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll be more appealing to quest-only users.\n\n37. Swarm \u2013 like windlands but with better combat and without everything else. If someone combines the two it\u2019s gonna be an A.\n\n38. Rinlo \u2013 Meh puzzle game that started with good potential for storytelling. Honestly it would be better as a VR movie.\n\n39. RuinsMagus \u2013 Not for me, but if you\u2019re a 10yo that loves anime you\u2019ll love this.\n\n40. Hinge VR \u2013 It looks like there\u2019s a solid horror game here I just got frustrated by the semi-random deaths and puzzle design and quit.\n\n41. Tower Devender VR: Last Adventure \u2013 Nice auto-tower RTS, but I quickly beat the boss and felt like I had enough. Good for viveport!\n\n42. Swordsman \u2013 a nice-ish arena fighter, that\u2019s all about learning to abuse enemy AI. Got tons of patches. Lots of weapon variety, but I just hide under bigass shield and hit the legs ezpz. Would be a B if the campaign features exploration and not repetitive arenas.\n\n43. Twilight Path \u2013 The puzzles aren\u2019t particularly good, and there isn\u2019t enough wow factor for an intro game. Would be good for kids.\n\nD tier and D tier Arcade (games I regret wasting time on)\n\n1. The forest VR \u2013 f this port\n\n2. Seeking dawn \u2013 boooring\n\n3. Falcon age \u2013 C tier everything, but with bugs. Shame. Awesome concept.\n\n4. Lucky\u2019s Tale - \\*pukomotion\\*\n\n5. Dead and buried \u2013 It was a B tier, but aged poorly\n\n6. Rick and Morty \u2013 they joke in game about them stealing money from you. Lmao, but fuck\u2019em. I pirate this shit. Lazy af\n\n7. Space Junkies \u2013 Dead game. Maybe it would have been good for a bit. Feels like a multiplayer addon of another game. Like echo combat.\n\n8. LA noire VR \u2013 YOU CAN\u2019T JUST FUCKING CUT A STORY BASED GAME IN 100 PIECES AND GIVE 50 RANDOM ONES! DEFAQ\n\n9. Altdeus \u2013 some creative writing concepts can\u2019t carry almost everything else being bad\n\n10. Ultimate Fishing simulator VR \u2013 performance issues. The point of a game like this for me is to feel like you\u2019re in nature, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m playing a meh video game for the small time I played it. PS: I didn\u2019t play much so perhaps I\u2019m too harsh.\n\n11. To the top \u2013 It lists as if working with index controllers, but it did not work for me at all. This is probs a C\/B tier normally.  \n Edit. I finally tried to play it with quest pro. I didn\u2019t like any of it. Poor graphics. Meh gameplay. UI issues. Music is OK\n\n12. Richie\u2019s plank experience \u2013 supposedly a good introductory VR title. A trace of older times, and a testament a mediocre overpriced game can sell a lot with enough \u201cinfluencers\u201d. One of the games responsible for the mediocracy flood.\n\n13. Vengeful Rites \u2013 I got bored during the tutorial\n\n14. Ark Park \u2013 Could not turn with valve index even though the game says it supports it.\n\n15. Torn \u2013 sigh\n\n16. Obduction \u2013 Couldn\u2019t solve a draw distance bug. Shame. I think I would have loved this game.\n\n17. Cyber Car \u2013 Awful controls and tech demo-ish. It feels like it has great potential when you start but then it nopes.\n\n18. Stride \u2013 CTD\u2026 CTD\u2026 CTD\u2026\n\n19. Djinni &amp; Thaco \u2013 Controls didn\u2019t work.

It\u2019s a little tech demo-ish like boneworks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be. It\u2019s an artsy game, so subjectivity plays a larger role (ymma).

But I did not play it much because I already overplayed it pancake&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Room VR 6 9 6 0 \u2013 too good for a B, but not good enough for an A. good puzzle game with nice atmosphere&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vertigo Remastered 6 7 7 0 \u2013 an incredibly polished game considering one person made it. Kinda half-life-ish, but blander and generally not as interesting.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westworld: Awakenings 8 6 6 0 \u2013 the most expansive advertisement ever. Don\u2019t buy at full price. Very good acting and facial animations and a nice story are lowered down by meh gameplay. I suggest playing on easy and focus on enjoying the enjoyable parts&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the Rabbit hole 6 6 5 1 \u2013 Good game for kids (7-11). Cool use of perspective.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fisherman\u2019s tale 6 7 6 1 \u2013 another cool little puzzle story game with nice use of perspective.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixel Ripped 1989\/1995 \u2013 I stopped playing both games after trying them for 30 min. I thought \u201cwow this is cool\u201d and quickly I was really bored. I\u2019d put them in C but they are way too good for C on the objective levels.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maskmaker 7 8 6 0 \u2013 one of the best indie walking simulators with out there. Biggest issues was puzzles were too light.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phantom Covert Ops 6 7 8 0 \u2013 an AAA game trying to do something unique VR-wise and does it with good polish. I hope to see a sequel with richer game. it\u2019s my favorite of the grey games I\u2019ve tried.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnage Chronicles 6 7 8 2 \u2013 If you played asgard\u2019s wrath this is pretty good with gameplay and visuals but far from as good. It has a fully functional co-op, but annoying voice chat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song in the Smoke \u2013 5 7 6 1. It\u2019s a solid survival game I\u2019m just not that much into that. Not much story. Exploration is fun. I dislike repetitive survival grind. Combat isn\u2019t good so it doesn\u2019t justify it. Probably subjectively C now that I think about it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife \u2013 5 7 4 2. This is a C game but I have a soft spot for WoD. Why is the franchise cursed \u2639? Good sound design and some nice exploration. OK plot. Some frustrating stealth. Cool enemies.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eternal Starlight \u2013 3 6 8 3 A space fleet real-time w\/ pause rogue like. Awesome concept. I wish this was AAA so it would be an A game. Barebones story like FTL. Cool weapon and encounter diversity. Mostly I just love the fantasy of being a space fleet captain.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great C 8 - - 0 it\u2019s a 35 min VR movie, and while it\u2019s not great enough to be A, it is the best of its kind so it gets A-&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Form \u2013 5 8 7 0 One of the best games to introduce someone new to VR. Intuitive and pretty. Very short.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fracked \u2013 3 5 7 1 \u2013 a solid action adventure with climbing and shooting and skiing. Nice all-rounder.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last Labyrinth 7 7 7 3 \u2013 Very good minimalistic storytelling and puzzles. Super annoying to 100%. Very dark - not for most ppl!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short experiences: I rate these B because they do not overstay their welcome. Just short and fun.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow the legend&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolves in the Walls&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mission ISS&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghost in the shell. Nice Ad&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lost&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious tale of the stolen pets&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lab&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayahuasca \u2013 this is very trippy, be warned&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firebird - La Peri&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B Tier Arcade:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boneworks 4 6 8 1. It\u2019s a tech demo. I had fun and it\u2019s smooth, but nothing amazing. Nice valve-ish humor at time.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided meditation VR \u2013 This can be excellent depending on the person using it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echo combat\/arena \u2013 not sure if there are players&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Earth VR&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium \u2013 this is essentially paint in VR&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetris effect \u2013 It\u2019s the best TETRIS game ever made!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thumper&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOX VR\/Audica\/Pistol Whip\/OhShape \u2013 if you really get into beat saber there\u2019s plenty of good quality similar things to diversify.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gun Club VR \u2013 it\u2019s something between a tech demo and a museum shooting range. Very \u2018Merica. It\u2019s well made for what it is.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermilion \u2013 It\u2019s just a paint simulator. If you like chilling and painting.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayak: Mirage \u2013 Quite Good kayak racing, but what it\u2019s really for is using \u201ctour\u201d option and going on spinning wheels irl!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C Tier and C Tier Arcade (games I feel bad paying for)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson\u2019s heart I feel like this game would have been good if I enjoyed the story. But it was meh to me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw data \u2013 a first wave VR wave shooter. Looks great, but didn\u2019t age well&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spice and Wolf VR 1\/2 \u2013 I love spice and wolf, but both the games were very shallow compared to the anime&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb \u2013 it was great then, it didn\u2019t age well. I hope this game\u2019s mechanics will be a small part of another game one day.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Sunshine \u2013 didn\u2019t age well generic zombie shooter.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking dead Saints and sinners \u2013 I found this game quite boring. Boring survival. Boring plot. Meh combat. But it is well reviewed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorn \u2013 It\u2019s fun for the gimmick but grows boring very fast.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Death \u2013 I got bored fast. Maybe too fast to rate it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space pirate trainer \u2013 Good introductory VR game&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apex Construct \u2013 cool bow. But just play skyrim instead. (much cooler bow)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget cuts \u2013 awesome 1 trick game (teleportation mechanic is really cool). Maybe it should be a B tier. I just completely forgot about it so it\u2019s probs a C&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious Sam VR. All of them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Espire 1 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why this game wasn\u2019t fun. But it wasn\u2019t. they did a lot great. :S &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge of nowhere \u2013 meh and a little puke&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellblade VR \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent game. But it doesn\u2019t gain anything from VR, except in the dark scene.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windlands \u2013 it\u2019s a nice relaxing spiderman simulator on easy with nice music. Prob had worse experience than most because valve index acceleration issue.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lies Beneath \u2013 It\u2019s a good horror game, if you expect a game that is adapted for mobile graphics and performance. I refunded it after an hour and a half also because I had stuff I wanted to play more. simplified graphics\/experience aside, this is at least a B&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carly and the reaperman \u2013 it might be fun as a bonding experience with a kid or something. Was not having fun, but maybe because it wasn\u2019t for me. (possibly clouded judgement because I played as the boring side on flatscreen)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmodread \u2013 I\u2019m usually into horror and rogue-likes but it just didn\u2019t click with me. I stopped early, so I may have misjudged it. I think I have a bias against overly gray games, like espire.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elven Assassin \u2013 It\u2019s pretty basic but I had fun. Better with friends.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnomes &amp;amp; Goblins \u2013 It has pretty good visual design. 1 hour campaign, and some sandbox-ish exploration. If it was 5$ it\u2019s be B.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luna \u2013 I found the gameplay tedious which lowered the enjoyment to C from B\u2026 stopped in the middle. Cute story and art though.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creed Rise to Glory \u2013 Meh. But I suppose if you really specifically want to box in a ring it\u2019s solid.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to properly rate, but it\u2019s similar to eagle flight, and has a good amount of diversity, even though I preferred eagle flight\u2019s take on it. Might be a B tier.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chair in a Room Greenwater \u2013 I really liked it but I had a save file issue and had to watch half the game on youtube&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanishing Realms \u2013 Aged poorly&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellsplit: arena \u2013 arena games are just lazy (some games even have them as an extra something to do), and the combat is just ok.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surv1V3 \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to have a solid opinion but it was pretty boring to play solo while I did.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mare \u2013 A relaxing game about a bird guiding an orphaned girl through a post-apocalyptic zone. Sounds like an A, but quest graphics, easy puzzles, and underwhelming plot make it very underwhelming.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deisim \u2013 If you like games like stacklands this\u2019ll be a B tier for you. Simple god management game with simple graphics. I hope someone makes a god simulator RPG with cool branching narratives some day it\u2019ll be A for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironlights \u2013 I expected to love it when I started\u2026 I hate weapon delay that\u2019s meant to simulate weight. It keeps breaking immersion. Mixing Until you fall with wobbly Gorn sounds great but doesn\u2019t work for me. I recognize there\u2019s a lot of polish in it though.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking Simulator VR \u2013 For me this type of gaming is only fun when it\u2019s a mini game inside another RPG. Seems really polished, but not for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Final Assault \u2013 I barely played it because I wasn\u2019t into it so it might be a B game. I\u2019m more of an eternal starlight guy&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warplanes WW1 fighters \u2013 After MSFS and SW: Squadrons this just felt underwhelming. Haven\u2019t played much.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warplanes Battles over \u2013 Same as above.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrawings 2 \u2013 maybe it\u2019ll be more appealing to quest-only users.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swarm \u2013 like windlands but with better combat and without everything else. If someone combines the two it\u2019s gonna be an A.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rinlo \u2013 Meh puzzle game that started with good potential for storytelling. Honestly it would be better as a VR movie.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;RuinsMagus \u2013 Not for me, but if you\u2019re a 10yo that loves anime you\u2019ll love this.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge VR \u2013 It looks like there\u2019s a solid horror game here I just got frustrated by the semi-random deaths and puzzle design and quit.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tower Devender VR: Last Adventure \u2013 Nice auto-tower RTS, but I quickly beat the boss and felt like I had enough. Good for viveport!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swordsman \u2013 a nice-ish arena fighter, that\u2019s all about learning to abuse enemy AI. Got tons of patches. Lots of weapon variety, but I just hide under bigass shield and hit the legs ezpz. Would be a B if the campaign features exploration and not repetitive arenas.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twilight Path \u2013 The puzzles aren\u2019t particularly good, and there isn\u2019t enough wow factor for an intro game. Would be good for kids.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D tier and D tier Arcade (games I regret wasting time on)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forest VR \u2013 f this port&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking dawn \u2013 boooring&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falcon age \u2013 C tier everything, but with bugs. Shame. Awesome concept.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky\u2019s Tale - *pukomotion*&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead and buried \u2013 It was a B tier, but aged poorly&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick and Morty \u2013 they joke in game about them stealing money from you. Lmao, but fuck\u2019em. I pirate this shit. Lazy af&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space Junkies \u2013 Dead game. Maybe it would have been good for a bit. Feels like a multiplayer addon of another game. Like echo combat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA noire VR \u2013 YOU CAN\u2019T JUST FUCKING CUT A STORY BASED GAME IN 100 PIECES AND GIVE 50 RANDOM ONES! DEFAQ&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altdeus \u2013 some creative writing concepts can\u2019t carry almost everything else being bad&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Fishing simulator VR \u2013 performance issues. The point of a game like this for me is to feel like you\u2019re in nature, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m playing a meh video game for the small time I played it. PS: I didn\u2019t play much so perhaps I\u2019m too harsh.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the top \u2013 It lists as if working with index controllers, but it did not work for me at all. This is probs a C\/B tier normally.&lt;br\/&gt;\nEdit. I finally tried to play it with quest pro. I didn\u2019t like any of it. Poor graphics. Meh gameplay. UI issues. Music is OK&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie\u2019s plank experience \u2013 supposedly a good introductory VR title. A trace of older times, and a testament a mediocre overpriced game can sell a lot with enough \u201cinfluencers\u201d. One of the games responsible for the mediocracy flood.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vengeful Rites \u2013 I got bored during the tutorial&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ark Park \u2013 Could not turn with valve index even though the game says it supports it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torn \u2013 sigh&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obduction \u2013 Couldn\u2019t solve a draw distance bug. Shame. I think I would have loved this game.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyber Car \u2013 Awful controls and tech demo-ish. It feels like it has great potential when you start but then it nopes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stride \u2013 CTD\u2026 CTD\u2026 CTD\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Djinni &amp;amp; Thaco \u2013 Controls didn\u2019t work.

Granted, it does depend on the type of a gamer you are because some are able to pour much more time than others, and perhaps they go through games much quicker. But overall, I would say the market is quite decent. \n\nI usually have 2 to 3 hours available for gaming each day, so keep in mind that I\u2019m not a \u201chardcore\u201d gamer by the usual standards. It\u2019s also worth noting that the listed games aren\u2019t all of the games from my collection, just the ones I\u2019ve had most fun playing, and would wholeheartedly recommend. Still, you may find some of the titles I\u2019d consider WOW remarkably boring, and that\u2019s okay. We all have our own preferences when it comes to games, food, and spaceships.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the games:\n\n**Half-Life: Alyx** \\- One of my favorite games. A wonderful blend of great storytelling and action, with beautiful graphics, sound, and intuitive gameplay mechanics.\n\n**Skyrim VR** \\- An RPG that probably found its way into every serious gamer's library. It's a great game that found new life inside VR. Beautiful, immersive and charming.\n\n**Into the Radius** \\- My current favorite FPS game. A sleeper hit that I bought thanks to Reddit, after reading many great things about it. Truly unique atmosphere, great sound design, and gunplay that is simply amazing. Attention to detail when it comes to weapons is astonishing.\n\n**Subnautica** \\- Wonderful underwater adventure. It is both scary and mesmerizing, set in a distinct world and it has a great atmosphere. It's a really enjoyable experience on many levels.\n\n**Horror Bar VR** \\- Spooky cooking sim. For those moments when you just wanna relax and have fun. Original concept, goofy graphics, and hilarious monsters. Serving all sorts of disgusting things to them so they can munch is more interesting than it might sound.\n\n**Asseto Corsa** \\- My favorite racing sim. When it comes to immersion, realism and looks, this game takes the crown in a world of driving simulations. It is challenging, beautiful and extremely fun to play. \n\n**MS Flight Simulator** \\- Most realistic flight sim I played. I'm aware there is a lifelong debate about which flight sim is the best. Personally, I consider MS Flight Simulator to be the clear winner. It is an experience that is tough to match, at least for all flight and aviation enthusiasts.\n\n**Bartender VR Simulator** \\- Realistic cocktail making sim. Mixing virtual drinks in some beautiful looking bars, all while listening to chill music is quite a stress relief. Challenging and rewarding for anyone who's into cocktails and the skill needed to fix them properly.\n\n**BeatSaber** \\- First person rhythmic workout. Honestly, I don't know how else to describe it. It is fun, hectic and physically demanding. Pleasure and work for all the senses.\n\n**Among Us** \\- Imposter! Easy to play but not easy to describe. One of the most fun casual games to play against other people. Laughter is guaranteed, but it does come with some infuriating moments.\n\n**Eleven Table Tennis** \\- Super chill sports sim. I love table tennis in RL, so the VR version was a no-brainer for me. Decent physics, fun to play, and addictive.\n\n**Walkabout Mini Golf** \\- Lovely golf sim. I just love this one. I love anything related to golf, and even though this is not your PGA Tour for VR, it is a blast to play. It\u2019s also very relaxing and pleasant to play.\n\n**Star Wars: Squadrons** \\- It's a Star Wars game! For me, that alone is enough because I'm a huge fan of anything related to Star Wars, but in all seriousness, it is a great game. Piloting iconic fighters from one of my favorite universes is a very special experience.\n\nApart from the list of the games I\u2019ve played, there\u2019s also a list of the games I\u2019ve been planning on buying in the next couple of months. Some of them are already launched, some are still in works, but imo all of them are worth checking out.\n\n**Workshop Simulator** \\- Because I love those kinds of games. Going by Jung, I'm definitely a thinker, but working with my hands relaxes me a lot, and that's why I'm looking forward to this game's launch.\n\n**I expect you to die 1 &amp; 2** \\- Because I heard so many great things about it.\n\n**No Man's Sky** \\- For the same reason as the game above.\n\n**Superhot VR** \\- Because apparently, it's a must have, and I wanna see why so many people speak positively of it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve taken into consideration the fact that different people can have widely different tastes in video games when writing this post and did my best to include different types of games to match everyone\u2019s preferences. If you have some that should be added to the list as examples of excellent VR games, don\u2019t shy away from writing them in the comments.\n\nHope you had a good read!","author_fullname":"t2_5r2ta8fue","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I\u2019ve compiled a list of the best games I\u2019ve played for those who feel like there\u2019s a shortage of good titles for VR, and for those who are just looking for something new to play","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_15jx90i","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.92,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":44,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":44,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1691347788.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019ve seen more than a handful of people talking about a shortage of good VR games in the past couple of weeks.

Skyrim (mod) 7 9 10 3 \u2013 It\u2019s just so amazing to walk freely in a huge fantasy land, even if NPCs are duds and dungeons are repetitive.  \n ranged and magic combat is quite good.\n\n4. Fallout (mod) 8 10 10 4 \u2013 the mods are so amazingly variant! And the story is quite good with mods! So many weapons! Exploration is great, but combat is also pretty good until you become overpowered. Biggest gripe is power armor not being fun in VR.\n\n5. HLA 9 7 8 0 \u2013 I was really underwhelmed by the lack of VR features in a valve flagship, but it was very good experience anyway.\n\n6. Microsoft flight simulator 2020\n\n7. The Talos Principle VR 10 8 8 1 \u2013 some subjectivity here. I really like the philosophical themes.\n\n8. paper beast 6 9 7 0. exploration and physics stuff really shines in VR. It\u2019s a little tech demo-ish like boneworks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be. It\u2019s an artsy game, so subjectivity plays a larger role (ymma). Get on sale anyway because really short (3.5 hours) A-\n\n9. The Great C 8 - - 0 it\u2019s a 35 min VR movie, and while it\u2019s not great enough to be A, it is the best of its kind so it gets A-\n\nA Tier Arcade:\n\n1. Superhot \u2013 awesome but short\n\n2. Beat Saber \u2013 awesome but fuck microtransactions\n\n3. Robo recall \u2013 awesome. Weird how this is still arguably one of the best arcade VRs with it being first wave game.\n\n4. Until you fall \u2013 the only other game besides Asgard\u2019s wrath which does great melee combat\n\n5. Racket: Nx \u2013 while not as good as the other games here, I felt B wouldn\u2019t do it justice. Best game for anger management \ud83d\ude0a\n\nB Tier: (things you should play if you find appealing)\n\n1. Unspoken 6 7 9 1. I really like the concept of casting spells with gestures and I\u2019m sad it\u2019s underused in VR.\n\n2. The Wizards Enhanced Edition 5 6 9 0 I really love dr. strange spell casting in VR. \n\n3. The Wizards \u2013 Dark Times 6 8 9 1 B+ It\u2019s the best of its kind (gesture spell casting campaign). Very GPU demanding. UE has so much potential for VR. Gameplay is awesome and environment and lighting are cool.\n\n4. From other suns \\~ 8 8 0 I love the genre and I played with online friends at the time, so I enjoyed it a lot. Not sure how it aged\n\n5. Layers of Fear 9 8 6 4. Great story, and VR adds a lot to the immersion. Poor port though\n\n6. Sairento VR 6 6 9 1. I think it\u2019s great as an arcade game, but it has a campaign with a story technically. I had great fun for 5 hours then had enough.\n\n7. The Invisible Hours 8 9 7 1 good story and excellent storytelling mechanics\n\n8. Star Wars Squadrons 7 7 8 1 Flying a spaceship in VR is awesome. I just don\u2019t love star wars too much. And gameplay isn\u2019t perfect.\n\n9. No man\u2019s sky VR 7 9 7 0 The only game that was ported to VR and you can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s better VR than most non-ports. Exploration and flight in VR is amazing, but when I last played the story and quest were just fetchy and buildy. I got bored before I finished it (After 100 hours though)\n\n10. Stormland 6 7 8 3 arguably C tier with valve index headache\n\n11. Eagle flight 4 7 8 1 I had a really good time with it.\n\n12. Borderlands 2 VR 7 8 9 1 This Isn\u2019t the best port, but in retrospect I had great fun playing this game. My biggest issue is the poor balance for single player. They did give all the DLC for free. So good guy devs.\n\n13. Windlands 2 - 2 7 7 1 very fun&amp;smooth platformer with simplistic graphics and bow battles. Bosses are fun, but general enemies are boring.\n\n14. Transpose \\~ 7 7 1 Good Puzzle game.\n\n15. Doom VFR 4 5 8 2 maybe a B-. I had good time.\n\n16. Risk of Rain 2 \u2013 4 7 7 3 the mod works well for most characters! But I did not play it much because I already overplayed it pancake\n\n17. The Room VR 6 9 6 0 \u2013 too good for a B, but not good enough for an A. good puzzle game with nice atmosphere\n\n18. Vertigo Remastered 6 7 7 0 \u2013 an incredibly polished game considering one person made it. Kinda half-life-ish, but blander and generally not as interesting.\n\n19. Westworld: Awakenings 8 6 6 0 \u2013 the most expansive advertisement ever. Don\u2019t buy at full price. Very good acting and facial animations and a nice story are lowered down by meh gameplay. I suggest playing on easy and focus on enjoying the enjoyable parts\n\n20. Down the Rabbit hole 6 6 5 1 \u2013 Good game for kids (7-11). Cool use of perspective.\n\n21. A fisherman\u2019s tale 6 7 6 1 \u2013 another cool little puzzle story game with nice use of perspective.\n\n22. Warplanes WW1 fighters \u2013 I didn\u2019t play it enough to have an opinion. Seemed like a B.\n\n23. Pixel Ripped 1989\/1995 \u2013 I stopped playing both games after trying them for 30 min. I thought \u201cwow this is cool\u201d and quickly I was really bored. I\u2019d put them in C but they are way too good for C on the objective levels.\n\n24. Maskmaker 7 8 6 0 \u2013 one of the best indie walking simulators with out there. Biggest issues was puzzles were too light.\n\n25. Phantom Covert Ops 6 7 8 0 \u2013 an AAA game trying to do something unique VR-wise and does it with good polish. I hope to see a sequel with richer game. it\u2019s my favorite of the grey games I\u2019ve tried.\n\n26. Karnage Chronicles 6 7 8 2 \u2013 If you played asgard\u2019s wrath this is pretty good with gameplay and visuals but far from as good. It has a fully functional co-op, but annoying voice chat.\n\n27. Song in the Smoke \u2013 5 7 6 1. It\u2019s a solid survival game I\u2019m just not that much into that. Not much story. Exploration is fun. I dislike repetitive survival grind. Combat isn\u2019t good so it doesn\u2019t justify it. Probably subjectively C now that I think about it.\n\n28. Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife \u2013 5 7 4 2. This is a C game but I have a soft spot for WoD. Why is the franchise cursed \u2639? Good sound design and some nice exploration. OK plot. Some frustrating stealth. Cool enemies.\n\n29. Eternal Starlight \u2013 3 6 8 3 A space fleet real-time w\/ pause rogue like. Awesome concept. I wish this was AAA so it would be an A game. Barebones story like FTL. Cool weapon and encounter diversity. Mostly I just love the fantasy of being a space fleet captain.  \n Handling your ships can be quite annoying\u2026 both finding your ships and picking them and targeting the right enemy systems takes too many actions\u2026 and I think a game like FTL should be comfortable first.\n\n1. Crow the legend \u2013 short experiences. I rate these B because they do not overstay their welcome. Just short and fun experiences\n\n2. Wolves in the Walls\n\n3. Henry\n\n4. Mission ISS\n\n5. Ghost in the shell. Nice Ad\n\n6. Lost\n\n7. Curious tale of the stolen pets\n\n8. The lab\n\n9. Ayahuasca \u2013 (this is very trippy, be warned)\n\nB Tier Arcade:\n\n1. Boneworks 4 6 8 1. It\u2019s a tech demo. I had fun and it\u2019s smooth, but nothing amazing. Nice valve-ish humor at time.\n\n2. Guided meditation VR \u2013 haha. I guess.\n\n3. Echo combat\/arena \u2013 not sure if there are players\n\n4. Google Earth VR \u2013 ?\n\n5. Medium \u2013 this is essentially paint in VR\n\n6. Tetris effect \u2013 It\u2019s the best TETRIS game ever made!\n\n7. Thumper\n\n8. BOX VR\/audica\/pistol whip\/OhShape \u2013 if you really get into beat saber there\u2019s plenty of good quality similar things to diversify.\n\n9. Gun Club VR \u2013 it\u2019s something between a tech demo and a museum shooting range. Very \u2018Merica. It\u2019s well made for what it is, but it wasn\u2019t much for me.\n\n10. Vermilion \u2013 It\u2019s just a paint simulator. If you like chilling and painting.\n\n11. Walkabout Mini Golf \u2013 I expected to dislike it but they managed to make the game feel like a chill puzzle and the controls are good.\n\nC Tier and C Tier Arcade (games I feel bad paying for)\n\n1. Wilson\u2019s heart I feel like this game would have been good if I enjoyed the story. But it was meh to me.\n\n2. Raw data \u2013 a first wave VR wave shooter. Looks great, but didn\u2019t age well\n\n3. Spice and Wolf VR 1\/2 \u2013 I love spice and wolf, but both the games were very shallow compared to the anime\n\n4. The climb \u2013 it was great then, it didn\u2019t age well. I hope this game\u2019s mechanics will be a small part of another game one day.\n\n5. Arizona Sunshine \u2013 didn\u2019t age well generic zombie shooter.\n\n6. Walking dead Saints and sinners \u2013 I found this game quite boring. Boring survival. Boring plot. Meh combat. But it is well reviewed.\n\n7. Gorn \u2013 It\u2019s fun for the gimmick but grows boring very fast.\n\n8. In Death \u2013 I got bored fast. Maybe too fast to rate it.\n\n9. Space pirate trainer \u2013 Good introductory VR game\n\n10. Apex Construct \u2013 cool bow. But just play skyrim instead. (much cooler bow)\n\n11. Budget cuts \u2013 awesome 1 trick game (teleportation mechanic is really cool). Maybe it should be a B tier. I just completely forgot about it so it\u2019s probs a C\n\n12. Serious Sam VR. All of them.\n\n13. Espire 1 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why this game wasn\u2019t fun. But it wasn\u2019t. they did a lot great. :S \n\n14. Edge of nowhere \u2013 meh and a little puke\n\n15. Hellblade VR \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent game. But it doesn\u2019t gain anything from VR, except in the dark scene.\n\n16. Windlands \u2013 it\u2019s a nice relaxing spiderman simulator on easy with nice music. Prob had worse experience than most because valve index acceleration issue.\n\n17. Lies Beneath \u2013 It\u2019s a good horror game, if you expect a game that is adapted for mobile graphics and performance. I refunded it after an hour and a half also because I had stuff I wanted to play more. simplified graphics\/experience aside, this is at least a B\n\n18. Carly and the reaperman \u2013 it might be fun as a bonding experience with a kid or something. Was not having fun, but maybe because it wasn\u2019t for me. (possibly clouded judgement because I played as the boring side on flatscreen)\n\n19. Cosmodread \u2013 I\u2019m usually into horror and rogue-likes but it just didn\u2019t click with me. I stopped early, so I may have misjudged it. I think I have a bias against overly gray games, like espire.\n\n20. Elven Assassin \u2013 It\u2019s pretty basic but I had fun. Better with friends.\n\n21. Gnomes &amp; Goblins \u2013 It has pretty good visual design. 1 hour campaign, and some sandbox-ish exploration. If it was 5$ it\u2019s be B.\n\n22. Luna \u2013 I found the gameplay tedious which lowered the enjoyment to C from B\u2026 stopped in the middle. Cute story and art though.\n\n23. Creed Rise to Glory \u2013 Meh. But I suppose if you really specifically want to box in a ring it\u2019s solid.\n\n24. Rush \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to properly rate, but it\u2019s similar to eagle flight, and has a good amount of diversity, even though I preferred eagle flight\u2019s take on it. Might be a B tier.\n\n25. A Chair in a Room Greenwater \u2013 I really liked it but I had a save file issue and had to watch half the game on youtube\n\n26. Vanishing Realms \u2013 Aged poorly\n\n27. Hellsplit: arena \u2013 arena games are just lazy (some games even have them as an extra something to do), and the combat is just ok.\n\n28. Surv1V3 \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to have a solid opinion but it was pretty boring to play solo while I did.\n\n29. Mare \u2013 A relaxing game about a bird guiding an orphaned girl through a post-apocalyptic zone. Sounds like an A, but quest graphics, easy puzzles, and underwhelming plot make it very underwhelming.\n\n30. Deisim \u2013 If you like games like stacklands this\u2019ll be a B tier for you. Simple god management game with simple graphics. I hope someone makes a god simulator RPG with cool branching narratives some day it\u2019ll be A for me.\n\n31. Ironlights \u2013 I expected to love it when I started\u2026 I hate weapon delay that\u2019s meant to simulate weight. It keeps breaking immersion. Mixing Until you fall with wobbly Gorn sounds great but doesn\u2019t work for me. I recognize there\u2019s a lot of polish in it though.\n\n32. Cooking Simulator VR \u2013 For me this type of gaming is only fun when it\u2019s a mini game inside another RPG. Seems really polished, but not for me.\n\nD tier and D tier Arcade (games I regret wasting time on)\n\n1. The forest VR \u2013 f this port\n\n2. Seeking dawn \u2013 boooring\n\n3. Falcon age \u2013 C tier everything, but with bugs. Shame. Awesome concept.\n\n4. Lucky\u2019s Tale - \\*pukomotion\\*\n\n5. Dead and buried \u2013 It was a B tier, but aged poorly\n\n6. Rick and Morty \u2013 they joke in game about them stealing money from you. Lmao, but fuck\u2019em. I pirate this shit. Lazy af\n\n7. Space Junkies \u2013 Dead game. Maybe it would have been good for a bit. Feels like a multiplayer addon of another game. Like echo combat.\n\n8. LA noire VR \u2013 YOU CAN\u2019T JUST FUCKING CUT A STORY BASED GAME IN 100 PIECES AND GIVE 50 RANDOM ONES! DEFAQ\n\n9. Altdeus \u2013 some creative writing concepts can\u2019t carry almost everything else being bad\n\n10. Ultimate Fishing simulator VR \u2013 performance issues. The point of a game like this for me is to feel like you\u2019re in nature, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m playing a meh video game for the small time I played it. PS: I didn\u2019t play much so perhaps I\u2019m too harsh.\n\n11. To the top \u2013 It lists as if working with index controllers, but it did not work for me at all. This is probs a C\/B tier normally.  \n Edit. I finally tried to play it with quest pro. I didn\u2019t like any of it. Poor graphics. Meh gameplay. UI issues. Music is OK\n\n12. Richie\u2019s plank experience \u2013 supposedly a good introductory VR title. A trace of older times, and a testament a mediocre overpriced game can sell a lot with enough \u201cinfluencers\u201d. One of the games responsible for the mediocracy flood.\n\n13. The Swordsman \u2013 Fatal Error does not launch (this isn\u2019t a real score I\u2019m just annoyed wasting time on it).\n\n14. Vengeful Rites \u2013 I got bored during the tutorial\n\n15. Ark Park \u2013 Could not turn with valve index even though the game says it supports it.","author_fullname":"t2_5y3joot4","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"My list.

I really like the philosophical themes.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;paper beast 6 9 7 0. exploration and physics stuff really shines in VR. It\u2019s a little tech demo-ish like boneworks, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s meant to be. It\u2019s an artsy game, so subjectivity plays a larger role (ymma). Get on sale anyway because really short (3.5 hours) A-&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Great C 8 - - 0 it\u2019s a 35 min VR movie, and while it\u2019s not great enough to be A, it is the best of its kind so it gets A-&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Tier Arcade:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superhot \u2013 awesome but short&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beat Saber \u2013 awesome but fuck microtransactions&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robo recall \u2013 awesome. Weird how this is still arguably one of the best arcade VRs with it being first wave game.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until you fall \u2013 the only other game besides Asgard\u2019s wrath which does great melee combat&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racket: Nx \u2013 while not as good as the other games here, I felt B wouldn\u2019t do it justice. Best game for anger management \ud83d\ude0a&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;B Tier: (things you should play if you find appealing)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unspoken 6 7 9 1. I really like the concept of casting spells with gestures and I\u2019m sad it\u2019s underused in VR.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wizards Enhanced Edition 5 6 9 0 I really love dr. strange spell casting in VR. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wizards \u2013 Dark Times 6 8 9 1 B+ It\u2019s the best of its kind (gesture spell casting campaign). Very GPU demanding. UE has so much potential for VR. Gameplay is awesome and environment and lighting are cool.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From other suns ~ 8 8 0 I love the genre and I played with online friends at the time, so I enjoyed it a lot. Not sure how it aged&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layers of Fear 9 8 6 4. Great story, and VR adds a lot to the immersion. Poor port though&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sairento VR 6 6 9 1. I think it\u2019s great as an arcade game, but it has a campaign with a story technically. I had great fun for 5 hours then had enough.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Invisible Hours 8 9 7 1 good story and excellent storytelling mechanics&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star Wars Squadrons 7 7 8 1 Flying a spaceship in VR is awesome.

And gameplay isn\u2019t perfect.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No man\u2019s sky VR 7 9 7 0 The only game that was ported to VR and you can\u2019t tell. It\u2019s better VR than most non-ports. Exploration and flight in VR is amazing, but when I last played the story and quest were just fetchy and buildy. I got bored before I finished it (After 100 hours though)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stormland 6 7 8 3 arguably C tier with valve index headache&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eagle flight 4 7 8 1 I had a really good time with it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borderlands 2 VR 7 8 9 1 This Isn\u2019t the best port, but in retrospect I had great fun playing this game.

It\u2019s a tech demo. I had fun and it\u2019s smooth, but nothing amazing. Nice valve-ish humor at time.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided meditation VR \u2013 haha. I guess.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Echo combat\/arena \u2013 not sure if there are players&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Earth VR \u2013 ?&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medium \u2013 this is essentially paint in VR&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tetris effect \u2013 It\u2019s the best TETRIS game ever made!&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thumper&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOX VR\/audica\/pistol whip\/OhShape \u2013 if you really get into beat saber there\u2019s plenty of good quality similar things to diversify.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gun Club VR \u2013 it\u2019s something between a tech demo and a museum shooting range. Very \u2018Merica. It\u2019s well made for what it is, but it wasn\u2019t much for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vermilion \u2013 It\u2019s just a paint simulator. If you like chilling and painting.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walkabout Mini Golf \u2013 I expected to dislike it but they managed to make the game feel like a chill puzzle and the controls are good.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C Tier and C Tier Arcade (games I feel bad paying for)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson\u2019s heart I feel like this game would have been good if I enjoyed the story. But it was meh to me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raw data \u2013 a first wave VR wave shooter. Looks great, but didn\u2019t age well&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spice and Wolf VR 1\/2 \u2013 I love spice and wolf, but both the games were very shallow compared to the anime&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climb \u2013 it was great then, it didn\u2019t age well. I hope this game\u2019s mechanics will be a small part of another game one day.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Sunshine \u2013 didn\u2019t age well generic zombie shooter.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking dead Saints and sinners \u2013 I found this game quite boring. Boring survival. Boring plot. Meh combat. But it is well reviewed.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorn \u2013 It\u2019s fun for the gimmick but grows boring very fast.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Death \u2013 I got bored fast. Maybe too fast to rate it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space pirate trainer \u2013 Good introductory VR game&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apex Construct \u2013 cool bow. But just play skyrim instead. (much cooler bow)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budget cuts \u2013 awesome 1 trick game (teleportation mechanic is really cool). Maybe it should be a B tier. I just completely forgot about it so it\u2019s probs a C&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious Sam VR. All of them.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Espire 1 \u2013 I don\u2019t understand why this game wasn\u2019t fun. But it wasn\u2019t. they did a lot great. :S &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edge of nowhere \u2013 meh and a little puke&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellblade VR \u2013 it\u2019s an excellent game. But it doesn\u2019t gain anything from VR, except in the dark scene.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windlands \u2013 it\u2019s a nice relaxing spiderman simulator on easy with nice music. Prob had worse experience than most because valve index acceleration issue.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lies Beneath \u2013 It\u2019s a good horror game, if you expect a game that is adapted for mobile graphics and performance. I refunded it after an hour and a half also because I had stuff I wanted to play more. simplified graphics\/experience aside, this is at least a B&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carly and the reaperman \u2013 it might be fun as a bonding experience with a kid or something. Was not having fun, but maybe because it wasn\u2019t for me. (possibly clouded judgement because I played as the boring side on flatscreen)&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cosmodread \u2013 I\u2019m usually into horror and rogue-likes but it just didn\u2019t click with me. I stopped early, so I may have misjudged it. I think I have a bias against overly gray games, like espire.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elven Assassin \u2013 It\u2019s pretty basic but I had fun. Better with friends.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gnomes &amp;amp; Goblins \u2013 It has pretty good visual design. 1 hour campaign, and some sandbox-ish exploration. If it was 5$ it\u2019s be B.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luna \u2013 I found the gameplay tedious which lowered the enjoyment to C from B\u2026 stopped in the middle. Cute story and art though.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creed Rise to Glory \u2013 Meh. But I suppose if you really specifically want to box in a ring it\u2019s solid.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rush \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to properly rate, but it\u2019s similar to eagle flight, and has a good amount of diversity, even though I preferred eagle flight\u2019s take on it. Might be a B tier.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chair in a Room Greenwater \u2013 I really liked it but I had a save file issue and had to watch half the game on youtube&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanishing Realms \u2013 Aged poorly&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellsplit: arena \u2013 arena games are just lazy (some games even have them as an extra something to do), and the combat is just ok.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surv1V3 \u2013 I didn\u2019t play enough to have a solid opinion but it was pretty boring to play solo while I did.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mare \u2013 A relaxing game about a bird guiding an orphaned girl through a post-apocalyptic zone. Sounds like an A, but quest graphics, easy puzzles, and underwhelming plot make it very underwhelming.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deisim \u2013 If you like games like stacklands this\u2019ll be a B tier for you. Simple god management game with simple graphics. I hope someone makes a god simulator RPG with cool branching narratives some day it\u2019ll be A for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironlights \u2013 I expected to love it when I started\u2026 I hate weapon delay that\u2019s meant to simulate weight. It keeps breaking immersion. Mixing Until you fall with wobbly Gorn sounds great but doesn\u2019t work for me. I recognize there\u2019s a lot of polish in it though.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking Simulator VR \u2013 For me this type of gaming is only fun when it\u2019s a mini game inside another RPG. Seems really polished, but not for me.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;D tier and D tier Arcade (games I regret wasting time on)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forest VR \u2013 f this port&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking dawn \u2013 boooring&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falcon age \u2013 C tier everything, but with bugs. Shame. Awesome concept.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucky\u2019s Tale - *pukomotion*&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead and buried \u2013 It was a B tier, but aged poorly&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rick and Morty \u2013 they joke in game about them stealing money from you. Lmao, but fuck\u2019em. I pirate this shit. Lazy af&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space Junkies \u2013 Dead game. Maybe it would have been good for a bit. Feels like a multiplayer addon of another game. Like echo combat.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LA noire VR \u2013 YOU CAN\u2019T JUST FUCKING CUT A STORY BASED GAME IN 100 PIECES AND GIVE 50 RANDOM ONES! DEFAQ&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altdeus \u2013 some creative writing concepts can\u2019t carry almost everything else being bad&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimate Fishing simulator VR \u2013 performance issues. The point of a game like this for me is to feel like you\u2019re in nature, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel I\u2019m playing a meh video game for the small time I played it. PS: I didn\u2019t play much so perhaps I\u2019m too harsh.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the top \u2013 It lists as if working with index controllers, but it did not work for me at all. This is probs a C\/B tier normally.&lt;br\/&gt;\nEdit. I finally tried to play it with quest pro. I didn\u2019t like any of it. Poor graphics. Meh gameplay. UI issues. Music is OK&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richie\u2019s plank experience \u2013 supposedly a good introductory VR title. A trace of older times, and a testament a mediocre overpriced game can sell a lot with enough \u201cinfluencers\u201d. One of the games responsible for the mediocracy flood.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swordsman \u2013 Fatal Error does not launch (this isn\u2019t a real score I\u2019m just annoyed wasting time on it).&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vengeful Rites \u2013 I got bored during the tutorial&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ark Park \u2013 Could not turn with valve index even though the game says it supports it.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c0266eea-07f8-11e6-bd33-0ebd65f9ef9d","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","id":"15iqxt8","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Coffee_Break_Hero","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":51,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/15iqxt8\/my_list_what_do_you_disagree_with_most\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/15iqxt8\/my_list_what_do_you_disagree_with_most\/","subreddit_subscribers":108608,"created_utc":1691227094.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"It\u2019s no surprise that VR games are the ultimate experience when it comes to simulation games. No other platform offers such immersiveness, nor can \u201cpull you in\u201d the world as well as VR does because in VR, you aren\u2019t playing a character in a world, you *are* the character and you *are* a part of that world.\n\nFollowing that line of thought, it\u2019s safe to say simulation games in VR can serve as a bridge between a childhood fantasy, a dream job, or simply a desire to experiment, and try out all that stuff without having to undergo all the effort\/risk of doing it IRL. Someone said \u201cVR simulation games are the closest we\u2019ve come to experiencing life second hand\u201d, and I\u2019ll use that quote here because it illustrates my point perfectly.\n\nThis is why I decided to compile a list of my favorite 10 VR sim games and hopefully help others find something for themselves because VR really does offer something for everyone. I also tried to have as much variety in this list to include something for everyone\u2019s taste and cover as many subgenres as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Asseto Corsa** \\- Fantastic driving sim. Pros: very accurate and realistic driving physics, high-quality graphics, and a wide selection of cars and tracks. Cons: a somewhat steep learning curve, limited single-player content, ai behavior and decision-making, and hardware requirements. Awesome game and one of the best in this genre. If you\u2019re a fan of driving sims, this one is a must-try.\n\n**Horror Bar VR** \\- Goofy and truly enjoyable cooking sim. Pros: very original setting, funny monster design, filled with humor, the well-realized potential of VR. Cons: no tutorial, occasional physics-related problems, lack of multiplayer. I\u2019m personally a huge fan of cooking sims and have played many of them, so deciding on only one to include here was a nightmare. Nevertheless, Horror Bar VR made the list because it\u2019s simply that much different and unique in comparison to other titles from this subgenre. Serving food made out of nightmare fuel to zombies in a goofy environment that makes it look funny instead of scary is just a phenomenal experience.\n\n**Euro Truck Simulator 2** \\- Great truck driving sim. Pros: relaxing and enjoyable gameplay, quality graphics and environments, vast open-world map, customization options for your truck. Cons: repetitive gameplay, limited interaction with the environment, limited VR features, no multiplayer. Even though driving trucks isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea, for those who do enjoy this type of game, ETS2 is one of the best.\n\n**Microsoft Flight Simulator VR** \\- The best flying sim on the market. Pros: incredible immersion, stunning visuals, realistic flight physics, vast open-world map, an impressive collection of aircraft, and multiplayer interaction. Cons: extremely demanding when it comes to hardware, very steep learning curve, limited VR controls, initial VR setup.\n\n**Bartender VR** **Simulator**\\- Relaxing cocktail-making sim. Pros: good graphics, relaxing and immersive atmosphere, real cocktail recipes, fun to play and learn, several different locations. Cons: it can be quite challenging, has rigorous standards, the lack of multiplayer. The one thing I regret A LOT about high school is that I never tried working as a bartender. So many of my friends did, yet I always chose to pursue my interests in the digital world because I wanted to be a game dev. Seeing so many bartenders do cool stuff (even more since the YT shorts got popular) ignited that interest even more, so when I first saw Bartender VR, it was a must-play for me. As a plus, it helped me learn how to make some cool cocktails for parties, even though it can\u2019t be compared to the IRL experience you\u2019d get from a real job.\n\n**Blade and Sorcery** \\- Fun physics-based combat game. Pros: realistic physics model and combat, freedom, and creativity, modding support, fully embraced VR potential, regular updates. Cons: limited content, lack of story-driven content, subpar graphics compared to some other similar titles, steep learning curve. It is an immensely fun and immersive sandbox combat sim, set in a medieval fantasy world. Could be considered one of the best games for lovers of medieval-style combat. The OG game is great, but Nomad is what you're looking for because it has just that much better combat that doesn't feel weightless.\n\n**Car Mechanic Simulator VR** \\- Fun job sim for car enthusiasts. Pros: hands-on interaction, intuitive approach to car parts and tools, detailed car models, realistic mechanics. Cons: hardware requirements, limited gameplay depth, simplified in comparison to its non-VR counterpart, control, and navigation. I have several friends who are really into handy stuff (especially when it comes to cars), but the tools needed to do this IRL can cost up to a few thousand $. If you\u2019re this type of person, and have a VR headset, this game could be a lifechanger and save you a ton of money.\n\n**Walkabout Mini Golf** \\- Fantastic mini golf game. Pros: very pleasing to the eye, intuitive controls, positive and relaxing atmosphere, great physics-based gameplay, easy to learn, multiplayer, regular content updates. Cons: limited courses, potential lack of depth for some players who seek a more serious golfing game. This game is widely regarded as one of the best casual VR games, similar to how Into the Radius is widely regarded as one of the best atmospheric VR games. I\u2019ve met only a handful of people who haven\u2019t enjoyed it, which says a lot about how well-done this game is.\n\n**Onward** \\- Great tactical first-person shooter. Pros: high level of realism, tactical depth, great multiplayer experience, regular updates. Cons: steep learning curve, limited player base, graphics aren't that good, some performance issues. It is a very realistic tactical FPS that emphasizes strategy, team cooperation and is a very authentic military simulation. It's not your typical run&amp;gun type of game which can be either a curse or a blessing depending on your preferences. The playerbase used to be a lot bigger than it is today, but due to a lack of new updates, many people shifted to Contractors, Pavlov, and Ghosts of Tabor.\n\n**The Climb** \\- Great rock climbing sim. Pros: an impressively immersive experience, stunning environments, intuitive controls, challenging gameplay, frequent updates, and content. Cons: limited gameplay variety, appealing to the small niche, replayability, lack of multiplayer. I\u2019ve always been a fan of extreme sports and wanted to do something like this IRL, but due to the lack of time (and guts), never had the chance to really give it a proper shot. Doing it in VR scratched that itch while keeping me in a safe environment\u2026 if we count out the few times I\u2019ve fallen down or broken something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far, congratulations! The last thing I\u2019d like to note is that this list is subjective and mainly based on my own experience\/taste. I haven\u2019t done any kind of research when trying to determine which games to include on this list, but simply based it on my own experience, and the experience\/comments of many people I\u2019ve talked to here. Still, I hope I\u2019ve managed to stay as objective and informative as possible when it comes to reviewing the games - and as helpful for the players looking to expand their libraries.\n\nThanks for reading and take care!","author_fullname":"t2_mz1nb4t5","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Top 10 VR simulator games - A brief list","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_15gng3l","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.95,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":18,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":18,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1691109658.0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1691018656.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s no surprise that VR games are the ultimate experience when it comes to simulation games.

As a plus, it helped me learn how to make some cool cocktails for parties, even though it can\u2019t be compared to the IRL experience you\u2019d get from a real job.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blade and Sorcery&lt;\/strong&gt; - Fun physics-based combat game. Pros: realistic physics model and combat, freedom, and creativity, modding support, fully embraced VR potential, regular updates. Cons: limited content, lack of story-driven content, subpar graphics compared to some other similar titles, steep learning curve. It is an immensely fun and immersive sandbox combat sim, set in a medieval fantasy world. Could be considered one of the best games for lovers of medieval-style combat. The OG game is great, but Nomad is what you&amp;#39;re looking for because it has just that much better combat that doesn&amp;#39;t feel weightless.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car Mechanic Simulator VR&lt;\/strong&gt; - Fun job sim for car enthusiasts. Pros: hands-on interaction, intuitive approach to car parts and tools, detailed car models, realistic mechanics. Cons: hardware requirements, limited gameplay depth, simplified in comparison to its non-VR counterpart, control, and navigation. I have several friends who are really into handy stuff (especially when it comes to cars), but the tools needed to do this IRL can cost up to a few thousand $. If you\u2019re this type of person, and have a VR headset, this game could be a lifechanger and save you a ton of money.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walkabout Mini Golf&lt;\/strong&gt; - Fantastic mini golf game. Pros: very pleasing to the eye, intuitive controls, positive and relaxing atmosphere, great physics-based gameplay, easy to learn, multiplayer, regular content updates. Cons: limited courses, potential lack of depth for some players who seek a more serious golfing game. This game is widely regarded as one of the best casual VR games, similar to how Into the Radius is widely regarded as one of the best atmospheric VR games. I\u2019ve met only a handful of people who haven\u2019t enjoyed it, which says a lot about how well-done this game is.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onward&lt;\/strong&gt; - Great tactical first-person shooter. Pros: high level of realism, tactical depth, great multiplayer experience, regular updates. Cons: steep learning curve, limited player base, graphics aren&amp;#39;t that good, some performance issues. It is a very realistic tactical FPS that emphasizes strategy, team cooperation and is a very authentic military simulation. It&amp;#39;s not your typical run&amp;amp;gun type of game which can be either a curse or a blessing depending on your preferences. The playerbase used to be a lot bigger than it is today, but due to a lack of new updates, many people shifted to Contractors, Pavlov, and Ghosts of Tabor.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Climb&lt;\/strong&gt; - Great rock climbing sim. Pros: an impressively immersive experience, stunning environments, intuitive controls, challenging gameplay, frequent updates, and content. Cons: limited gameplay variety, appealing to the small niche, replayability, lack of multiplayer. I\u2019ve always been a fan of extreme sports and wanted to do something like this IRL, but due to the lack of time (and guts), never had the chance to really give it a proper shot. Doing it in VR scratched that itch while keeping me in a safe environment\u2026 if we count out the few times I\u2019ve fallen down or broken something.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, congratulations! The last thing I\u2019d like to note is that this list is subjective and mainly based on my own experience\/taste. I haven\u2019t done any kind of research when trying to determine which games to include on this list, but simply based it on my own experience, and the experience\/comments of many people I\u2019ve talked to here. Still, I hope I\u2019ve managed to stay as objective and informative as possible when it comes to reviewing the games - and as helpful for the players looking to expand their libraries.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and take care!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"c0266eea-07f8-11e6-bd33-0ebd65f9ef9d","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#7193ff","id":"15gng3l","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"CleverTrover","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":10,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/15gng3l\/top_10_vr_simulator_games_a_brief_list\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/15gng3l\/top_10_vr_simulator_games_a_brief_list\/","subreddit_subscribers":108608,"created_utc":1691018656.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"A couple of days ago, I stumbled upon a post where a guy was describing a lucid dream about two games that he played, and it got me thinking about experiences that leave a strong impression on players. \n\nEven though I played MANY games (and I do mean MANY), and even though I liked quite a large portion of those, certain games just affect you differently.\n\nIt is about the entire mix which consists of many components; from tiny details to major aspects.

the recent price drop of the Quest 2, I finally broke and decided to try VR. I have a decent PC and picked up a link cable, and if I were to stick with VR, I'd eventually want to upgrade, so **I'm mostly looking for PC VR games**, not Quest specific games (...assuming there even *are* games that are Quest only).\n\nThat said, I don't have much money to spare right now, and so I want to be pretty selective with what games I pick up. **I'm mostly looking for two main things--which can be two entirely separate games**, though bonus points if there's one game that covers both:\n\n- I want to find a game that feels like it justifies VR as a platform. The sort of game that feels like it's *the* reason to own a VR headset. Ideally, something that isn't \"this is good, but could have easily been made as a non-VR game\". The sort of thing that convinced you \"this is the sort of experience VR was *made* for\".\n\n- I want to find a game that allows for utter chaos. Games like the Saints Row series and Hitman series have been some of my favorite to mess with, doing some of the dumbest shit I could think of. (I know Hitman has a VR mode--and I've tried it--but I've also heard it's considered *really* bad.) I also just love causing chaos, explosions, messing with physics. Ideally this wouldn't be just fighting endless waves of enemies, but being able to mess with innocent bystanders as well--again, much like Saints Row and Hitman.\n\nAny and all suggestions are welcome. I will say that in general I tend to lean more towards \"bright and colorful\" as opposed to \"dirty and realistic\", and likewise I favor futuristic or modern over medieval style fantasy. Likewise, if speaking of combat, while realistic guns are cool, there's something to be said about the simple joys of, say, being able to yeet a fire extinguisher at someone's skull, or smash a wooden chair across their face, so bonus points for things like that.\n\nThank you for your time &lt;3","author_fullname":"t2_1288oq","gilded":0,"title":"Getting into VR on PC for the first time, and looking for two types of games: One \"experiences like these are what VR was made for\", and one \"unleash chaos upon innocent NPCs like an unhinged psychopath\"","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Request","score":1,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"suggested_sort":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1fda0eae-a82c-11eb-b96a-0eec46a3a3ff","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"removed_by":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","link_flair_background_color":"#46d160","id":"14j0zc9","is_robot_indexable":true,"author":"CaerulusDramal","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14j0zc9\/getting_into_vr_on_pc_for_the_first_time_and\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14j0zc9\/getting_into_vr_on_pc_for_the_first_time_and\/","subreddit_subscribers":107227,"created_utc":1687736151,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"retrieved_utc":1687736163,"updated_utc":1687736164,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-06-25 23:35:51"},{"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"I have a quest 2, but i don't really use it for standalone, i use it for pcvr.

You can probably guess my price range in between the two headsets i mentioned.\n\nMy pc specs are:\n\n\\-RTX 2070 Super\n\n\\-Core i5 12400f\n\n\\-32 gb ddr4 ram\n\n\\-I have good enough storage\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_43fzazso","gilded":0,"title":"What Vr headset should I upgrade to?","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","score":1,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"suggested_sort":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"removed_by":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"14h15bk","is_robot_indexable":true,"author":"SamirSellout","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14h15bk\/what_vr_headset_should_i_upgrade_to\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/14h15bk\/what_vr_headset_should_i_upgrade_to\/","subreddit_subscribers":107144,"created_utc":1687533225,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"retrieved_utc":1687533237,"updated_utc":1687681742,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-06-23 15:13:45"},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"Galactic Catch is a relaxing, fun story-driven game from 9x Emmy-winning Baobab Studios that launches June 29 on Meta Quest.

Something is different so I'm assuming either some type of aim assist, bullet tracking.","author_fullname":"t2_4xmuxfui","gilded":0,"title":"Vr Gun accuracy vs irl","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Question","score":1,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"suggested_sort":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"removed_by":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","id":"148ubxa","is_robot_indexable":true,"author":"xlews_ther1nx","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/148ubxa\/vr_gun_accuracy_vs_irl\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/148ubxa\/vr_gun_accuracy_vs_irl\/","subreddit_subscribers":106826,"created_utc":1686703804,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"retrieved_utc":1686703844,"updated_utc":1686703845,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-06-14 00:50:04"},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"i have been searching the internet for awhile look for a pacific rim type game.

See this thread for everyone's advice on what headset to get:  \n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iRacing\/comments\/13tleea\/best\\_vr\\_headset\\_for\\_iracing\\_2023\\_and\\_hardware\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iRacing\/comments\/13tleea\/best_vr_headset_for_iracing_2023_and_hardware\/)\n\nI am building the new computer system around a shiny new **ASUS TUF 4090 GPU**.  I want my new computer rig to:\n\n1. Be able to play 4K games with Ultra settings + HDR at high frame rates\n2. Be    able to use my Quest Pro headset with as stable a 90 FPS in sim  racing (iRacing in particular) as I can manage.

Since I'm a gamer all my life, and since I've been struggling with a bit of extra weight since the first Covid lockdown, this instantly sparked my interest.\n\nI started researching VR consoles and ultimately decided to get an Oculus set. Getting used to VR gaming wasn't easy at first because I was too used to playing games on PC, but after I week, I can say I got a good hang of it. I was able to tackle even the more requiring games, and it gave me the confidence to start my weight-loss journey.\n\n**The Games I'd Played:**\n\nThe first game I picked up was Beat Saber because it looked like it'd completely exhaust me physically. And it really did... I had a hard time keeping my schedule of 1-2 hours of game time a day because my muscles would get inflamed for days after just a single session, and then I'd have to force myself and push through. Fortunately, this stopped after 2 weeks, and by that time, I'd already lost more than 6 lbs (2.8 kg), so the progress motivated me to push further.\n\nFeeling stronger and fitter, I felt like it was the right time to get into the fitness VR games, but they just didn't strike the right vibe with me. I felt like actually exercising (which I could have done in the gym with a pro trainer anyways) instead of playing a game, and couldn't stick with a game longer than 1 hour. Deciding to quit them for good, I picked up another rhythm game called Synth Riders, which helped me lose another 8 lbs (3.6 kg). However, playing rhythm\/dance games day after day for about a month got quite monotonous and I decided to add a bit of flavor with a completely different type of game. Clash of Chefs, a VR cooking simulator had proven itself to be a perfect choice for this. It had great (at times demanding) gameplay, a coop mode, and it allowed me to experiment with all kinds of random stuff like stabbing or knife-fighting people or throwing dishes at customers, something no other cooking game had.\n\nMy sincere recommendation to anyone looking to embark on a similar journey is to find one physically demanding game as a base for weight loss, and then pair it up with a little less physically demanding, but more versatile game. This way, you'll both enjoy the gameplay, get better at games, lose weight, and ultimately have fun making the process much easier. Beat Saber and Synth Riders just happened to be the physically demanding games I enjoyed, but there are many others for everyone's taste. Clash of Chefs, on the other hand, was the one keeping me sane and excited about each session, as it gave me so many hours of incredible fun. I suggest all 3 of them to everyone, with an emphasis on Clash of Chefs.\n\n**The Schedule:**\n\nMy initial idea was to play every day for 1-2 hours, but I soon realized that, with my atrophied muscles, I couldn't have continued that routine for long. So, I had to make 1-day pauses in between the sessions, until I built a bit of muscle and got into a bit of shape. Then, I just went back to my initial idea and played for 1-2 hours each day (with the exception of birthdays, holidays, travels, etc.). I loved how flexible and easy to maintain this schedule was, and how easy it was to just jump right into playing. It's a HUGE plus over going to the gym (if you aren't looking for building big muscles).\n\n**The Diet:**\n\nI didn't care too much about my diet, except for the standard cuts in carbs and junk food. Basically, I reduced my carb intake to an operative minimum, but still allowed myself a can of Coke, a handful of candy, or a Subway sandwich each day. The main change, however, came to my calorie intake because I started tentatively measuring my daily calorie intake, and reduced it from around 2800 to 2300 a day until I reached my goal weight, then raised it to 2600 a day for maintenance. Not a huge change, but enough to help me lose weight when paired with the exercise I got from VR games.\n\n**The Progress and Weight Loss:**\n\nI lost around 23 lbs (10 kg) over the first three months because my body was still getting used to the new schedule, and I hadn't really figured out my diet yet. The next 3 months were a little more fruitful and I managed to lose around 34 pounds (15 kg) and to only a few pounds above my goal weight. Then I raised my daily calorie intake and lost only 6 lbs (3 kg) over the last 3 months of my journey. My total weight regressed from 257 lbs (117 kg) start weight, to 234 lbs (106kg) after the first quartal, then 200 lbs (91 kg) after the second quartal, and finally 194 lbs (88 kg) by the end of the third quartal. In total, I dropped from 257 lbs (117 kg) to 194 lbs (88 kg) over the course of 9 months.\n\n**Would I recommend this?**\n\nAbsolutely. It's been such an enjoyable ride and the results are fantastic, especially for a gamer who hasn't taken care of his body for way too long. What's better is that you won't ever feel like exercising because the line dividing gaming and exercising, in this case, is just the difficulty level. That's it, if you wanna lose weight, just play harder.

Since I&amp;#39;m a gamer all my life, and since I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with a bit of extra weight since the first Covid lockdown, this instantly sparked my interest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started researching VR consoles and ultimately decided to get an Oculus set. Getting used to VR gaming wasn&amp;#39;t easy at first because I was too used to playing games on PC, but after I week, I can say I got a good hang of it. I was able to tackle even the more requiring games, and it gave me the confidence to start my weight-loss journey.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Games I&amp;#39;d Played:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first game I picked up was Beat Saber because it looked like it&amp;#39;d completely exhaust me physically. And it really did... I had a hard time keeping my schedule of 1-2 hours of game time a day because my muscles would get inflamed for days after just a single session, and then I&amp;#39;d have to force myself and push through. Fortunately, this stopped after 2 weeks, and by that time, I&amp;#39;d already lost more than 6 lbs (2.8 kg), so the progress motivated me to push further.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling stronger and fitter, I felt like it was the right time to get into the fitness VR games, but they just didn&amp;#39;t strike the right vibe with me. I felt like actually exercising (which I could have done in the gym with a pro trainer anyways) instead of playing a game, and couldn&amp;#39;t stick with a game longer than 1 hour. Deciding to quit them for good, I picked up another rhythm game called Synth Riders, which helped me lose another 8 lbs (3.6 kg). However, playing rhythm\/dance games day after day for about a month got quite monotonous and I decided to add a bit of flavor with a completely different type of game. Clash of Chefs, a VR cooking simulator had proven itself to be a perfect choice for this. It had great (at times demanding) gameplay, a coop mode, and it allowed me to experiment with all kinds of random stuff like stabbing or knife-fighting people or throwing dishes at customers, something no other cooking game had.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My sincere recommendation to anyone looking to embark on a similar journey is to find one physically demanding game as a base for weight loss, and then pair it up with a little less physically demanding, but more versatile game. This way, you&amp;#39;ll both enjoy the gameplay, get better at games, lose weight, and ultimately have fun making the process much easier. Beat Saber and Synth Riders just happened to be the physically demanding games I enjoyed, but there are many others for everyone&amp;#39;s taste. Clash of Chefs, on the other hand, was the one keeping me sane and excited about each session, as it gave me so many hours of incredible fun. I suggest all 3 of them to everyone, with an emphasis on Clash of Chefs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Schedule:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My initial idea was to play every day for 1-2 hours, but I soon realized that, with my atrophied muscles, I couldn&amp;#39;t have continued that routine for long. So, I had to make 1-day pauses in between the sessions, until I built a bit of muscle and got into a bit of shape. Then, I just went back to my initial idea and played for 1-2 hours each day (with the exception of birthdays, holidays, travels, etc.). I loved how flexible and easy to maintain this schedule was, and how easy it was to just jump right into playing. It&amp;#39;s a HUGE plus over going to the gym (if you aren&amp;#39;t looking for building big muscles).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Diet:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t care too much about my diet, except for the standard cuts in carbs and junk food. Basically, I reduced my carb intake to an operative minimum, but still allowed myself a can of Coke, a handful of candy, or a Subway sandwich each day. The main change, however, came to my calorie intake because I started tentatively measuring my daily calorie intake, and reduced it from around 2800 to 2300 a day until I reached my goal weight, then raised it to 2600 a day for maintenance. Not a huge change, but enough to help me lose weight when paired with the exercise I got from VR games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Progress and Weight Loss:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lost around 23 lbs (10 kg) over the first three months because my body was still getting used to the new schedule, and I hadn&amp;#39;t really figured out my diet yet. The next 3 months were a little more fruitful and I managed to lose around 34 pounds (15 kg) and to only a few pounds above my goal weight. Then I raised my daily calorie intake and lost only 6 lbs (3 kg) over the last 3 months of my journey. My total weight regressed from 257 lbs (117 kg) start weight, to 234 lbs (106kg) after the first quartal, then 200 lbs (91 kg) after the second quartal, and finally 194 lbs (88 kg) by the end of the third quartal. In total, I dropped from 257 lbs (117 kg) to 194 lbs (88 kg) over the course of 9 months.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would I recommend this?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. It&amp;#39;s been such an enjoyable ride and the results are fantastic, especially for a gamer who hasn&amp;#39;t taken care of his body for way too long. What&amp;#39;s better is that you won&amp;#39;t ever feel like exercising because the line dividing gaming and exercising, in this case, is just the difficulty level. That&amp;#39;s it, if you wanna lose weight, just play harder. I&amp;#39;d also recommend the games I&amp;#39;ve played for weight loss, especially Clash of Chefs, which is, in my opinion, a must-try.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is already way longer than I imagined when I started writing it, so I&amp;#39;ll wrap it up here.

off, this is a basic guide, and I even used this subreddit to help learn about the topic. Just compiling different sources to a single area.\n\nVR is the process of using technology (Hardware and software) to immerse someone into another reality, typically a video game.\n\n# Headsets\n\nHeadsets are technology used to enter the VR world, which are goggles using computer screens instead of normal lenses, and have speakers.\n\n**Headset Variations:**\n\nThere are different types of VR headsets, providing different features and immersion.\n\nThe amount of immersion varies, with 3DoF (Degrees of freedom), which allows the user to look around, and 6DoF, which allows the user to look AND move around.\n\nThere are three implementations of VR headsets:\n\n|Mobile|Standalone|PCVR (PC and VR)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Uses a mobile device\u2014usually phone\u2014to give a 3DoF VR experience. Cheap, but no controllers or tracking.|Headset with their own internal processing chips to work by themselves. Usually 6DoF. Usually has controllers and tracking.|Connects to a PC (Or a gaming console) to use the processing power of the PC itself, which is either good or bad depending on the PC. Usually 6DoF. Usually has controllers and tracking|\n\n**IPD (Interpupillary Distance):**\n\n|IPD is the distance\u2014in millimeters\u2014between the eyes, specifically the center of the pupils. IPD affects the clarity of the image\/video. Proper headsets can adjust the IPD, although there are static headsets, which are usually set at 64 IPD (64 mm).|To measure IPD, take a ruler to a mirror, and follow these steps:\\[X\\]  Close the right eye.\\[X\\]  Line up the left eye to the start of the ruler.\\[X\\]  Close the left eye.\\[X\\]  Open the right eye.\\[X\\]  Use the number that lines up to the middle of the right eye\u2019s pupil.|\n|:-|:-|\n\n\n**Lens (And Glasses):**\n\nVR headsets may have adjustable compartments to fit glasses, although accidents still happen, scratching both the lens and the glasses.\n\nThe best option is to have a company create prescription lenses, to remove the need for glasses.\n\nVR lenses alter the path light takes, meaning VR lenses exposed to sunlight can damage the lenses themselves, along with the electronics.\n\n**Wired Vs Wireless:**\n\nWireless may have less performance, and connectivity issues, but has better immersion by design.\n\nWired headsets should have the cable tied to the back of the head strap, to prevent flailing arms from ripping the cable out.\n\nA pulley system can be installed in the ceiling to keep the cable in the air, as the cable on the ground can be stepped on, or tie up the user.\n\nAs the user turns around the same direction over time, the cable gets twisted internally, which can cause damage if rotated the same direction long enough. Luckily there are programs which keep track of the turning, and inform the user which direction to turn around to fix the cable.\n\n# Tracking\n\nTracking improves immersion, by bringing the person\u2019s body, and movements, into the VR world.\n\nTracking normally just checks the head and hands, although there is full body tracking, to include the legs, hips, and even other parts.\n\n**How To Track:**\n\nTracking is done by using light and cameras, which figures out the position, rotation, and orientation of the various tracked body parts.\n\nCovering reflective surfaces, such as mirrors and monitors, can improve the tracking experience, as reflections can confuse the tracking equipment.\n\nWhile on paper, the types of tracking are inside-out (Cameras on the VR equipment tracking the environment), and outside-in (Cameras in the environment tracking the VR equipment), it seems that in practice the types of tracking are actually:\n\n|Standalone|Supported|\n|:-|:-|\n|The VR equipment itself handles all the tracking, requiring very little setup. Basic standalone setups will have the headset track the controllers, which loses tracking if the controllers break line of sight with the headset (Behind back, head, to the sides, etc). Amazing standalone setups have controllers that also track the environment, allowing for good tracking.|The VR equipment requires outside help for tracking. Requires more effort to setup. Outside cameras can be used to track the headset and controllers. Inside cameras (In the VR equipment) require markers. While QR codes can be painted on the walls, a more practical marker system is to use base stations (Lighthouses), which emit a light grid that the VR equipment can use to track themselves.|\n\nSupported tracking systems usually have better performance (Coverage and accuracy).\n\nFor outside-in tracking, the base stations should be installed high up in the corners of the room, such as \u00bc inch screw stands that lift the base stations up and angled down. Two base stations are fine for most rooms, although 3\u20134 can work for bigger rooms. Base stations need to be plugged into a socket for power, so keep in mind socket placement of the room, and the tripping hazard of the power cord.\n\n**Trackers:**\n\nNormally, VR equipment just tracks the user\u2019s head and hands (Controllers).\n\nAdditional physical trackers can be attached to the user\u2019s body for full body tracking. This requires software that handles supported tracking setups.\n\nThe trackers use batteries, meaning they can run out of power with a long enough VR session. Certain tracker straps can hold extra batteries, which weights the body down more.\n\nA camera can also be used with special programs to improve tracking, which is the cheapest yet the most unreliable option.\n\n**Controllers:**\n\nControllers allow the user to interact with the VR world, while also adding tracking to the hands.\n\nThe controllers have a life span until they need to be charged.\n\nBasic controllers simply track the hand as a whole, and use buttons for interactions, while proper controllers allow for individual finger tracking, and buttons which stiffen for non-binary inputs (Such as lightly grabbing something instead of clutching something).\n\n# Software\n\nSoftware is a bundle of code that tells the VR headset how to function, and is usually obtained from platforms, which host various different software, ranging from video games to tools.\n\n**SteamVR:**\n\nSteamVR is the most extensive VR platform, available on Steam, and created by Valve, a company that helped advance the gaming and Linux communities so much.\n\nSteamVR can use Proton, which is a compatibility layer for Linux, meaning SteamVR has amazing compatibility with Linux for most software.\n\n**Meta Store:**\n\nThe Meta store (Owned by Facebook), has a good collection of software. The store has sub-stores, for specific headsets, or type of software.\n\nFor headsets, there\u2019s the older Rift compatible software, and the newer Quest software, compatible with most headsets. The store also has content just for the headsets, or PCVR content for headsets that can connect to a PC.\n\nRevive is a program that may help non-Meta headsets handle the Meta store.\n\n**Room-Scale:**\n\nSome programs\/games support room-scale, which allows the user to move in the VR world by walking in the real world, whereas without room-scale, the user is stationary IRL.\n\n**Overlays:**\n\nOverlays offer an immersive connection to the PC, allowing the user to use their PC while in a VR game, without completely ruining immersion. This means a user can interact with PC software, such as an email client, while inside of VR.\n\n|Body (Typically the wrist)|Screens (Monitors)|\n|:-|:-|\n|Overlays can pop a screen out of a body part, such as the wrist, which can be used by streamers to quickly check their stream.|Screens act as PC monitors, just inside of VR, meaning a user with one physical monitor, can have a 9+ monitor setup in VR, which functions exactly as it would IRL.|\n\n**Utility:**\n\nSome additional utility software:\n\n* **fpsVR ($4):** Shows PC performance, battery life of VR devices, current time, tracks cable twisting for wired headsets, and edge of play area warning.\n* **VR performance toolkit:** Provides performance tweaks with supersampling and foveated rendering.\n\n# Tips\n\n**Environment:**\n\nVR headsets should allow the user to make a play area, which is the physical area IRL the person will occupy while inside VR, and will show a virtual fence at the edges to warn the user when they are close to the perimeters, to prevent the user from colliding with a wall.\n\nMake sure the play area does not have tripping hazards, anything dangling from the ceiling (Sloped down low ceiling, chandelier, fan, etc), furniture, animals, etc, and is over an arm\u2019s length away from the wall to prevent punching the wall.\n\n**Performance:**\n\nWhen experiencing poor performance, try to restart both the PC and VR equipment, lower the game and headset\u2019s settings, and use the following features:\n\n* **Frame smoothing:** Forces VR to run at half of the set frame rate, and add extra frames if possible, to guarantee stability (No stutters), while potentially having a smooth experience.\n* **Supersampling:** Renders at a lower resolution, and uses an AI (Artificial intelligence) to upscale the resolution for decent quality. AMD uses FSR, and Nvidia utilizes DLSS.\n* **Foveated rendering:** Displays resolution as a gradient, mimicking the human eye. High resolution at the center, and lower resolution at the edges.\n\n**Biological:**\n\nMotion sickness is normal with VR, requiring multiple short sessions to build up immunity.\n\n# Outro\n\nThanks for reading my post!

Just compiling different sources to a single area.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VR is the process of using technology (Hardware and software) to immerse someone into another reality, typically a video game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Headsets&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Headsets are technology used to enter the VR world, which are goggles using computer screens instead of normal lenses, and have speakers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headset Variations:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are different types of VR headsets, providing different features and immersion.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of immersion varies, with 3DoF (Degrees of freedom), which allows the user to look around, and 6DoF, which allows the user to look AND move around.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are three implementations of VR headsets:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Mobile&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Standalone&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;PCVR (PC and VR)&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Uses a mobile device\u2014usually phone\u2014to give a 3DoF VR experience. Cheap, but no controllers or tracking.&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Headset with their own internal processing chips to work by themselves. Usually 6DoF.

Usually 6DoF. Usually has controllers and tracking&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/tbody&gt;&lt;\/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IPD (Interpupillary Distance):&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;IPD is the distance\u2014in millimeters\u2014between the eyes, specifically the center of the pupils. IPD affects the clarity of the image\/video. Proper headsets can adjust the IPD, although there are static headsets, which are usually set at 64 IPD (64 mm).&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;To measure IPD, take a ruler to a mirror, and follow these steps:[X]  Close the right eye.[X]  Line up the left eye to the start of the ruler.[X]  Close the left eye.[X]  Open the right eye.[X]  Use the number that lines up to the middle of the right eye\u2019s pupil.&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;\/tbody&gt;&lt;\/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lens (And Glasses):&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VR headsets may have adjustable compartments to fit glasses, although accidents still happen, scratching both the lens and the glasses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best option is to have a company create prescription lenses, to remove the need for glasses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VR lenses alter the path light takes, meaning VR lenses exposed to sunlight can damage the lenses themselves, along with the electronics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wired Vs Wireless:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wireless may have less performance, and connectivity issues, but has better immersion by design.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wired headsets should have the cable tied to the back of the head strap, to prevent flailing arms from ripping the cable out.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pulley system can be installed in the ceiling to keep the cable in the air, as the cable on the ground can be stepped on, or tie up the user.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the user turns around the same direction over time, the cable gets twisted internally, which can cause damage if rotated the same direction long enough. Luckily there are programs which keep track of the turning, and inform the user which direction to turn around to fix the cable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tracking improves immersion, by bringing the person\u2019s body, and movements, into the VR world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tracking normally just checks the head and hands, although there is full body tracking, to include the legs, hips, and even other parts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Track:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tracking is done by using light and cameras, which figures out the position, rotation, and orientation of the various tracked body parts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Covering reflective surfaces, such as mirrors and monitors, can improve the tracking experience, as reflections can confuse the tracking equipment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While on paper, the types of tracking are inside-out (Cameras on the VR equipment tracking the environment), and outside-in (Cameras in the environment tracking the VR equipment), it seems that in practice the types of tracking are actually:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Standalone&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Supported&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The VR equipment itself handles all the tracking, requiring very little setup. Basic standalone setups will have the headset track the controllers, which loses tracking if the controllers break line of sight with the headset (Behind back, head, to the sides, etc). Amazing standalone setups have controllers that also track the environment, allowing for good tracking.&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The VR equipment requires outside help for tracking. Requires more effort to setup. Outside cameras can be used to track the headset and controllers. Inside cameras (In the VR equipment) require markers. While QR codes can be painted on the walls, a more practical marker system is to use base stations (Lighthouses), which emit a light grid that the VR equipment can use to track themselves.&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/tbody&gt;&lt;\/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Supported tracking systems usually have better performance (Coverage and accuracy).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For outside-in tracking, the base stations should be installed high up in the corners of the room, such as \u00bc inch screw stands that lift the base stations up and angled down. Two base stations are fine for most rooms, although 3\u20134 can work for bigger rooms. Base stations need to be plugged into a socket for power, so keep in mind socket placement of the room, and the tripping hazard of the power cord.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trackers:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally, VR equipment just tracks the user\u2019s head and hands (Controllers).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additional physical trackers can be attached to the user\u2019s body for full body tracking. This requires software that handles supported tracking setups.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The trackers use batteries, meaning they can run out of power with a long enough VR session. Certain tracker straps can hold extra batteries, which weights the body down more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A camera can also be used with special programs to improve tracking, which is the cheapest yet the most unreliable option.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controllers:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Controllers allow the user to interact with the VR world, while also adding tracking to the hands.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The controllers have a life span until they need to be charged.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basic controllers simply track the hand as a whole, and use buttons for interactions, while proper controllers allow for individual finger tracking, and buttons which stiffen for non-binary inputs (Such as lightly grabbing something instead of clutching something).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Software&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Software is a bundle of code that tells the VR headset how to function, and is usually obtained from platforms, which host various different software, ranging from video games to tools.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SteamVR:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SteamVR is the most extensive VR platform, available on Steam, and created by Valve, a company that helped advance the gaming and Linux communities so much.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SteamVR can use Proton, which is a compatibility layer for Linux, meaning SteamVR has amazing compatibility with Linux for most software.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta Store:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Meta store (Owned by Facebook), has a good collection of software. The store has sub-stores, for specific headsets, or type of software.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For headsets, there\u2019s the older Rift compatible software, and the newer Quest software, compatible with most headsets. The store also has content just for the headsets, or PCVR content for headsets that can connect to a PC.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revive is a program that may help non-Meta headsets handle the Meta store.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Room-Scale:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some programs\/games support room-scale, which allows the user to move in the VR world by walking in the real world, whereas without room-scale, the user is stationary IRL.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlays:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overlays offer an immersive connection to the PC, allowing the user to use their PC while in a VR game, without completely ruining immersion. This means a user can interact with PC software, such as an email client, while inside of VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Body (Typically the wrist)&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Screens (Monitors)&lt;\/th&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Overlays can pop a screen out of a body part, such as the wrist, which can be used by streamers to quickly check their stream.&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Screens act as PC monitors, just inside of VR, meaning a user with one physical monitor, can have a 9+ monitor setup in VR, which functions exactly as it would IRL.&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n&lt;\/tbody&gt;&lt;\/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utility:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some additional utility software:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fpsVR ($4):&lt;\/strong&gt; Shows PC performance, battery life of VR devices, current time, tracks cable twisting for wired headsets, and edge of play area warning.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VR performance toolkit:&lt;\/strong&gt; Provides performance tweaks with supersampling and foveated rendering.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tips&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environment:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VR headsets should allow the user to make a play area, which is the physical area IRL the person will occupy while inside VR, and will show a virtual fence at the edges to warn the user when they are close to the perimeters, to prevent the user from colliding with a wall.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure the play area does not have tripping hazards, anything dangling from the ceiling (Sloped down low ceiling, chandelier, fan, etc), furniture, animals, etc, and is over an arm\u2019s length away from the wall to prevent punching the wall.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When experiencing poor performance, try to restart both the PC and VR equipment, lower the game and headset\u2019s settings, and use the following features:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frame smoothing:&lt;\/strong&gt; Forces VR to run at half of the set frame rate, and add extra frames if possible, to guarantee stability (No stutters), while potentially having a smooth experience.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supersampling:&lt;\/strong&gt; Renders at a lower resolution, and uses an AI (Artificial intelligence) to upscale the resolution for decent quality. AMD uses FSR, and Nvidia utilizes DLSS.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foveated rendering:&lt;\/strong&gt; Displays resolution as a gradient, mimicking the human eye. High resolution at the center, and lower resolution at the edges.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motion sickness is normal with VR, requiring multiple short sessions to build up immunity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Outro&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading my post!

We started out wanting to compete against each other, but the moment one of us started messing up the orders, our gameplay would immediately turn into chaos and we would just start fighting, flailing our knives around like kids playing with sticks, using plates as shields in imagined combat scenarios and in general creating havoc all around us.
