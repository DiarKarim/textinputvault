If your television doesn't support this, you can, for example, buy a Chromecast stick that you plug into your television.\n\n**Tip 2: Set Quest 3 to factory settings**\n\nIf your VR headset no longer work at all, even after a restart, or you want to sell the headset and a reset via the app doesn't work, you can perform a factory reset from recovery mode. To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on. When the Meta logo is displayed, release the keys. In the menu that appears, select Factory Reset.\n\n**Tip 3: Reset view**\n\nTo reset the view of both your active app and the home menu, simply press and hold the meta button on the right controller for 2 seconds.\n\n**Tip 4: Refund app purchases**\n\nIf you purchased an app from the Meta Store, you can get a refund if you don't like it if you have used the app for less than 2 hours and purchased it no more than 14 days ago. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.\n\n**Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz**\n\nIf you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Display and activate \u201c120Hz refresh rate\u201d. Please note that it requires a little more battery power.\n\n**Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller**\n\nIf you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.\n\n**Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation**\n\nIf it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.\n\n**Tip 8: Avoid sunlight**\n\nMake sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds. The lenses are basically magnifying glasses and they can burn your display. It is therefore best not to use it outside or leave it near a window.\n\n**Tip 9: Avoid motion sickness**\n\nIf you are a VR beginner or generally prone to motion sickness, check how intensive the app is before you buy an app in the store. Green means comfortable, you can't get sick, but you should be more careful with the orange or even red category.\n\n**Tip 10: Room scan with furniture**\n\nYou can scan your entire room or even your entire apartment to prepare it for mixed reality apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Physical Room -&gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.\n\n**Tip 11: Developer Mode**\n\nFor some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode. To do this, go to the Meta developer page and change your account to a developer account. Then go to the smartphone app under Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Developer Settings and activate developer mode.\n\n**Tip 12: Controller Shortcuts**\n\nTo quickly take a photo of the current content of Quest 3, press the meta button on the right controller and the trigger button at the same time. The same thing works with video recordings; for this you also press the meta button but hold down the trigger a little longer. This also stops the recording. You can find the results if you press the camera symbol.\n\n**Tip 13: SideQuest + AppLab**\n\nTo access even more apps that are not in the official Meta Store, you can use the SideQuest PC software to install additional apps from the AppLab or APK files on your Quest 3. I made a [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY) about this.\n\n**Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC**\n\nYou can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless. I also made a [tutorial video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/14N78C3HtMU) about this.\n\n**Tip 15: Improve video recordings**\n\nThe Quest 3 can record video of the currently displayed content by going to the menu, clicking the camera icon, and then clicking Record Video.\n\nBut to set the recording quality and format, you have to go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Camera. Here you can make various recording settings.\n\n**Tip 16: Count calories**\n\nIf you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.\n\n**Tip 17: Watch films**\n\nYou can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3's integrated player. 3D films are also supported.\n\n**Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking**\n\nIf you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&gt; Motion Tracking -&gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.\n\n**Tip 19: Play in complete darkness**\n\nThe Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking. However, if you still want to use it in complete darkness, you will need infrared lights. A small module that you can plug directly into Quest 3 is available for purchase; you can find the link in the description. https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC\n\n**Tip 20: Save battery**\n\nTo extend the battery life of the Quest 3, you can, for example, switch off the WIFI function in the Quest 3 menu for single-player games. An extended battery mode can also be activated, which reduces the brightness, resolution and FPS to save battery. You can find this in the settings under System -&gt; Energy settings there you activate the \u201cextra battery mode\u201d.\n\n**Tip 21: Privacy settings**\n\nYou can adjust your Quest 3 privacy. Here you can, for example, set who sees your activities, create a private profile, manage device and app permissions or even assign a password to individual apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Privacy.\n\n**Tip 22: Smartphone notifications**\n\nYou can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.\n\n**Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard**\n\nYou can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.\n\n**Tip 24: Multitasking**\n\nYou can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.\n\n**Tip 25: Do not disturb**\n\nIf you don't want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.\n\n**Tip 26: App sharing**\n\nIf you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing. To do this, your friend must log in to your app under Settings and Account with their meta account on your Quest 3. You then activate app sharing in the same menu. Your friend will then have access to your game library on his Quest 3. Unfortunately, multiplayer games don't work with this.\n\n**Tip 27: Cross Buy List**\n\nSome games that you purchased from the Meta PC Store will automatically be available on your Quest 3 as standalone versions and vice versa, without you having to purchase them again. The games that support this are shown in a [list by Meta](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/). \n\n**Tip 28: Save with referral links**\n\nIf your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app -&gt; click on the three dots -&gt; then send referral link. You send the link to your friend, who then buys the game using it.\n\n**Tip 29: Install apps from your smartphone**\n\nYou can easily install apps on the Quest 3 from your smartphone. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app and then \u201cInstall to Headset\u201d.\n\n**Tip 30: Create an avatar**\n\nYou can create your own avatar for your meta account, which your friends can also see if you invite them to your home environment, for example. To do this, simply click on the mirror in your home environment and a window will open in which you can customize your avatar. You can turn the avatar mirror on and off in the settings under Personalization -&gt; Interactive Objects.\n\n**Tip 31: Activate passthrough mode quickly**\n\nTo activate the passthrough mode, that is the view of your real environment through the Quest 3, simply double-tap your hand against the Quest 3. If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.\n\n**Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes**\n\nThere are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly. The easiest, but least accurate, method is to use a ruler. It's better to have an app for your smartphone to measure the distance. You can find the link in the description. The safest method, however, is to go to an optician and have the distance measured. They often do this for free and it only takes a few seconds.\n\n**Tip 33: Disable Guardian System**\n\nIf you want to deactivate the Quest 3 security system, for example if you want to cover a larger area or for mixed reality apps, first activate the developer mode, I have already explained this to you in Tip 11. Then go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer and deactivate the guardian. However, be very careful when deactivating this security system!\n\n**Tip 34: WebVR games**\n\nYou can also play VR games with the Quest 3 via the built-in browser. To do this, open it and see a list of apps. In the \u201cBest of the Immersive Web\u201d category there are some good games and some free ones too. It takes a while for the games to start and you have to give the browser permission to start immersive apps.\n\n**Tip 35: Copy files from Quest 3**\n\nTo copy files from your Quest 3 to the PC, connect them to the PC with a USB-C cable. Then you have to confirm a dialog in Quest 3 and the file browser on the PC opens. You can find the recordings under Oculus-&gt;Videoshots, for example. Attention, the confirmation message no longer appears in Do Not Disturb mode!\n\n**Tip 36: Give help to beginners**\n\nIf you want to show Quest 3 to a friend and he is a complete beginner, you can support him during his VR session by, for example, starting apps via your smartphone. To do this, go to the smartphone app, then go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select an installed game and click \u201cStart\u201d. You can provide even more help by streaming the Quest 3 content to your phone. To do this, click on \u201cStream\u201d in the smartphone app under Menu -&gt; Devices -&gt; Meta Quest 3 -&gt;, select Meta Quest 3 again and press \u201cStart\u201d. Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.\n\n**Tip 37: Use hand straps**\n\nIt can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment. Especially when you throw things around in VR, you might end up throwing the controller into your window or the TV. It is therefore essential to always use the hand straps on the controllers, even if it means a few seconds more preparation time.\n\n**Tip 38: Change your virtual environment**\n\nYou can change the default home environment and, for example, beam yourself into a cyber city. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Virtual Environment and select a different environment. If you scroll all the way down, you can even use your own 360 degree image as your home environment.\n\n**Tip 39: Check for updates**\n\nYour Quest 3 does not always install the updates automatically. To check whether there is a new update, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Software Update. If an update is available here, it will be offered to you. Also activate the option \u201cAutomatically turn on the headset for updates\u201d to always have the latest updates, even if the quest is turned off.\n\n**Tip 40: Accessories**\n\nAs accessories, I can recommend the VR Cover for the facial interface, the original Elite Strap with battery or the M3 Pro Set from BoboVR. The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.\n\nIf you have time, I made a [20min video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs) about those tipps and tricks as well.  \nI hope there are some useful things for you in this list.  \nCheers  \nThomas","author_fullname":"t2_suryn","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"40 tips and tricks for Meta Quest 3","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17fa57e","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Meta","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1698145512.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;br\/&gt;\nI spent many days (and nights) to gather some cool tips and tricks for the Quest 3, here you go:  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 1: Casting to other devices&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By clicking on the camera button in the Quest 3 menu, you can stream the current view of Quest 3 to a TV, a browser or your cell phone so that your friends can watch you play. If your television doesn&amp;#39;t support this, you can, for example, buy a Chromecast stick that you plug into your television.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 2: Set Quest 3 to factory settings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your VR headset no longer work at all, even after a restart, or you want to sell the headset and a reset via the app doesn&amp;#39;t work, you can perform a factory reset from recovery mode. To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on. When the Meta logo is displayed, release the keys. In the menu that appears, select Factory Reset.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 3: Reset view&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reset the view of both your active app and the home menu, simply press and hold the meta button on the right controller for 2 seconds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 4: Refund app purchases&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you purchased an app from the Meta Store, you can get a refund if you don&amp;#39;t like it if you have used the app for less than 2 hours and purchased it no more than 14 days ago. To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &amp;gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Display and activate \u201c120Hz refresh rate\u201d. Please note that it requires a little more battery power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 8: Avoid sunlight&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds. The lenses are basically magnifying glasses and they can burn your display. It is therefore best not to use it outside or leave it near a window.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 9: Avoid motion sickness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a VR beginner or generally prone to motion sickness, check how intensive the app is before you buy an app in the store. Green means comfortable, you can&amp;#39;t get sick, but you should be more careful with the orange or even red category.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 10: Room scan with furniture&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can scan your entire room or even your entire apartment to prepare it for mixed reality apps. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Physical Room -&amp;gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 11: Developer Mode&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode. To do this, go to the Meta developer page and change your account to a developer account. Then go to the smartphone app under Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Developer Settings and activate developer mode.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 12: Controller Shortcuts&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To quickly take a photo of the current content of Quest 3, press the meta button on the right controller and the trigger button at the same time. The same thing works with video recordings; for this you also press the meta button but hold down the trigger a little longer. This also stops the recording. You can find the results if you press the camera symbol.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 13: SideQuest + AppLab&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To access even more apps that are not in the official Meta Store, you can use the SideQuest PC software to install additional apps from the AppLab or APK files on your Quest 3. I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY\"&gt;video&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless. I also made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/14N78C3HtMU\"&gt;tutorial video&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 15: Improve video recordings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 can record video of the currently displayed content by going to the menu, clicking the camera icon, and then clicking Record Video.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to set the recording quality and format, you have to go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Camera. Here you can make various recording settings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 16: Count calories&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 17: Watch films&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3&amp;#39;s integrated player. 3D films are also supported.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Motion Tracking -&amp;gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 19: Play in complete darkness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking. However, if you still want to use it in complete darkness, you will need infrared lights. A small module that you can plug directly into Quest 3 is available for purchase; you can find the link in the description. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC\"&gt;https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 20: Save battery&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To extend the battery life of the Quest 3, you can, for example, switch off the WIFI function in the Quest 3 menu for single-player games. An extended battery mode can also be activated, which reduces the brightness, resolution and FPS to save battery. You can find this in the settings under System -&amp;gt; Energy settings there you activate the \u201cextra battery mode\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 21: Privacy settings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can adjust your Quest 3 privacy. Here you can, for example, set who sees your activities, create a private profile, manage device and app permissions or even assign a password to individual apps. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Privacy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 22: Smartphone notifications&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 24: Multitasking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 25: Do not disturb&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 26: App sharing&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing.

Your friend will then have access to your game library on his Quest 3. Unfortunately, multiplayer games don&amp;#39;t work with this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 27: Cross Buy List&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some games that you purchased from the Meta PC Store will automatically be available on your Quest 3 as standalone versions and vice versa, without you having to purchase them again. The games that support this are shown in a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/\"&gt;list by Meta&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 28: Save with referral links&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store.

If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&amp;gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly.

Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 37: Use hand straps&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment.

The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have time, I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs\"&gt;20min video&lt;\/a&gt; about those tipps and tricks as well.&lt;br\/&gt;\nI hope there are some useful things for you in this list.&lt;br\/&gt;\nCheers&lt;br\/&gt;\nThomas&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a0f4d7ad1b8d9ef1efc0017f1a4e150a83bc388c","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99ced9e98c0c173af1b65d2471f89b0bd097b36","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda6f1786a827b772babe119bcc83b791ac058ce","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef4e2fe968aff71a134738169740f25ab4db7ad8","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"p5gn6u-c1-vedY3PYi49g4B8NN1nVAc5ulhUpBOvw6E"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"80664f0a-07f8-11e6-8590-0ebd65f9ef9d","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#d3d6da","id":"17fa57e","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"VoodooDE","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17fa57e\/40_tips_and_tricks_for_meta_quest_3\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/17fa57e\/40_tips_and_tricks_for_meta_quest_3\/","subreddit_subscribers":112615,"created_utc":1698145512.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"VRGaming","selftext":"Hello.\n\nI'm new to Reddit so may not be searching correctly, but I can't find much info about this issue so am posting here.\n\nI have a fairly new Oculus Quest 2, fully up to date, and have zero issues with any other apps (other than the device itself can be slow to download stuff at times even though I have an excellent WiFi connection to ultrafast internet).\n\nA friend invited me to play Vegas Infinite (formerly known as PokerStars VR, I understand). I have had an extremely frustrating experience with this game. It's been now about 2 weeks since I've initially installed this game on my device and I can't get past the login screens.\n\nSince I've installed the game there have been 3 major updates. The last 2 occurred in the last 3 days or so, the first one was about a 3GB update, and then another one today, which was 1.7GB in size. I hoped on any of those updates that they would resolve my issue, but they have not. I basically cannot play this game on the VR headset. So, having STEAM, I logged in using STEAM. From there I was able to link my e-mail account to the account, and I CAN play the game on STEAM, but that's not what I want to do. I want to play it on the VR!\n\nAnyway, here is the issue, in detail, that I'm having:\n\nWhen I load the game in VR, the main screen loads, which gives me the option of \"PLAY\", in a big, blank gray square option on the left side, or \"Login\", on the big square option on the right side, which has the Vegas Infinite logo, and my e-mail address, since it is now linked.\n\nIf I click on the \"login\" option, it blinks while I click the trigger, but nothing happens. Over and over I can click it and it does not respond other than the \"blink\" from squeezing the trigger.\n\nIf I select the gray \"PLAY\" option on the left side, then the swirly infinity symbol appears and spins around, and then the Vegas Infinite logo appears. Underneath the logo, a statement says \"You are now joining a table with a streamer. Behave yourself.\"\n\nAnd then it hangs. Nothing happens after that, no matter how long I wait, and no button functions. I have to force close the app to get out of it.\n\nSo. Below the \"login\" option, there is the option that says \"Email already linked? Join with name and password\". If you click that option, a username and password page shows up with a virtual keyboard.\n\nSo, I try putting in my email address and password, and click the action button (I think it says \"join\"). And... nothing happens. If I click it a second time too quickly, it will say \"Error. Try again in 4 seconds\". After a second or two it disappears, and if I click \"join\" again, then again, nothing happens. Etc.\n\nSo this is my experience with the game in VR. EXTREMELY frustrating. To the right at all times on either of those screens is the \"need support\" button, which if you click on it, it gives you a website to go to for support. That address is a weird address for some reason, a lovely thing to deal with when wearing your VR headset, but it ports to [support.vegasinfinite.com](https:\/\/support.vegasinfinite.com).\n\nFrom there, it has been another excruciatingly frustrating experience... they take DAYS to get back to you. I sent them an e-mail explaining what I just explained above. After THREE DAYS they responded with \"what's your username\"? Even though in the e-mail, I provided them with my e-mail address, which is unique. So, I replied with my username, and again confirmed my e-mail address to them for the account. I also updated them that I could in fact log in with STEAM, although that's not what I want to do. After another FOUR DAYS they responded with \"There are multiple users using that username (they allow multiple people to have the same username?!!! WHY?!), and they wanted my \"account balance and how many coins I have\". I don't even know what they mean by \"coins\" because I am new to the game! So, I replied to them with my account balance and what I THINK are my \"coins\", which I think have the infinite logo next to a number. That was FOUR DAYS AGO, and I still don't have a reply. So I'm into this tech support e-mail chain over a WEEK and they still haven't even \"verified\" my account to troubleshoot the issue with me. I mean... I've dealt with support people from India and China with people who can barely speak English and gotten better customer service than I'm getting from these people. They obviously don't care, and I think they are stalling because I think they know damn well what the problem is and they don't have a solution to the problem.  Oh yes. I should note: YES, I have tried completely uninstalling and re-installing the game several times. Verifying all files were deleted. That didn't do anything to fix this problem. And, as I said, I am NOT having any issues with any other apps on my Oculus. JUST THIS ONE.\n\nSo. Anyone else having this same issue? Do you also have an Oculus?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh. I guess I should note, that my friend that invited me to play this... has had the game for quite a while, I think he started playing it before it was called Vegas Infinite, and he does not have any problems logging into his game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_lredetkq2","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Vegas Infinite VR login problems","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_177tl80","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Gameplay (Quest Exclusive)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1697301728.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.VRGaming","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to Reddit so may not be searching correctly, but I can&amp;#39;t find much info about this issue so am posting here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a fairly new Oculus Quest 2, fully up to date, and have zero issues with any other apps (other than the device itself can be slow to download stuff at times even though I have an excellent WiFi connection to ultrafast internet).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A friend invited me to play Vegas Infinite (formerly known as PokerStars VR, I understand).

The PC hasn't crashed, I've still gotten Discord messages and background tasks are still working.\n\nI had recently updated my PC going from a 3770k and a 2060 to a 7700x and the same 2060. The VR setup stayed the same between the builds, a first gen Rift with 3 base stations mounted on my walls. Two of the stations and the headset have USB and an HDMI extension on them since I have plenty of room to use. This setup worked fine on the older 3770k build, I never experienced any drop outs.\n\nIs there any reason why this would be happening? I've tried playing modless on BS and updating the USB drivers for my motherboard (AsRock Steel Legend x670e).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOccasional troubleshooting edits below:\n\nEdit (2\/22\/23): I tried uninstalling and reinstalling SteamVR and Oculus with no avail. I Alt+F4'd BS after it disconnected the first time (when all my devices drop out and reconnect) and my PC hung for a solid 60 seconds.\n\nEdit 2 (2\/22\/23): I checked for a network USB printer driver and I couldn't find anything to uninstall. I did have task manager open and my CPU spiked to ~70% and my GPU got pinned at 100%. Everything was still working in the background and my usb devices were completely disconnected.\n\nEdit 3 (2\/22\/23): I saw a thing where maybe the iGPU could be messing with it based on what I saw with Edit 2. It still happend.\n\nEdit 4 (2\/22\/23): went down to the bare minimum for me to login to windows and play beat Saber, keyboard, mouse, the 3 sensors, headset, one monitor. Still happening. Turning off PBO (85C Max -40mV) as a shot in the dark.\n\nEdit 5 (2\/22\/23): Still dropping out after ~20 minutes. Dropped out 3 times but still reconnected. Turning off EXPO now.\n\nEdit 5.5 (2\/22\/23): As I type this on my phone, I closed BS and it dropped out and didnt reconnect while I was on the desktop and GPU spiked to 100%. The only VR thing running is the Oculus home crap that has to run in the background.\n\nEdit 6 (2\/22\/23): Turned off AMD EXPO and ran just oculus for 30 minutes, no crash, launched BS and dropped out within 7 minutes. I guess I can try memtest or a new Windows install, I have a spare nvme I can use.\n\nEdit 7 (2\/22\/23): Alright, productive afternoon I guess. Fresh install of Windows on my old machine just to make sure the headset isn't the actual problem (Spoiler, it's not). Ran BS for an hour and a half and the only drop out I had was one sensor for a split second but good luck trying to figure out which one it was, right? So my next plan of action is to do a fresh install of Windows on my spare nvme for my new PC and see what happens then. I'll have to get to that sometime on the weekend because I have streams planned and my PC has absolutely no signs of USBs disconnecting when I'm not in VR.\n\nEdit 8 (2\/26\/23): I've had time to reinstall Windows on that spare drive and the same result. Barebones setup. I guess it's time to start contacting AsRock or AMD, I'm not sure who this would fall under. My bet is AsRock.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":103092,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"USB Devices Drop Out [PCVR]","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/118i3l7\/usb_devices_drop_out_pcvr\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":false,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1676843487,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"116p16w","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_116p16w","no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/116p16w\/can_vr_gloves_use_a_virtual_keyboard\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":"deleted","retrieved_on":1678321647,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[deleted]","send_replies":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":103093,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Can VR gloves use a virtual keyboard?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"xxres1","author_created_utc":1631991980,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_em9n08rh","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1675470845,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10t08o1","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10t08o1","no_follow":true,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/10t08o1\/virtual_desktop_question\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678341427,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Ok, so I have an Oculus quest 2 and I love it.

The one I wanna focus on is the learning curve for video games. A lot of gaming and how you control your character or your gameplay is controlled through two major methods, console with analog sticks and bumpers and mouse and keyboard with WASD and mouse. For old people and people that have no experience in gaming it is a learning curve and how to control yourself because it\u2019s not entirely intuitive since you use your left hand to move the body in the right hand to move the view, there\u2019s not many instances where you do that outside of gaming. Another thing that is difficult is depth perception, since you are looking at screen and you\u2019re only using one hand\/thumb to move your character, to some the character might move too fast just with a little push, it\u2019s hard to understand how far objects or enemies are in relation to them, and if it\u2019s a fast paced game they lose track of anything since it will go out of view and forgot to be able to look and move at the same time. \n\nI think vr gaming would be good for old people is looking at the wii and its success. The Wii was popular with many people but one of the demographics that it really connected with was old people and those unfamiliar with gaming. The main thing that contribute to its success is it\u2019s controller style, you control it through the wii remote. With this blue market tech and different design from normal gaming consoles they connected very well with the former people I talked about. They used a remote since it would be quite simple to hold onto understand since many people have already used remotes. Who is much more intuitive to use it since the action that you usually do on screen is what you do in real life. For example, in wii sports when you play baseball you swing your arms like you are holding a bat, even if you might hold it incorrectly (somehow) you still do the motion that you\u2019re doing on screen which is normally intuitive for people since they\u2019ve probably have swung stick in real life. The same is for VR since you are utilizing your body in the virtual space, it\u2019s intuitive since the actions you do in game are what your body does in real life. This also connects to the depth perception because if you can measure movements and how fast your character is\/how big they are you can understand the world that is built around you. But this runs into one of the biggest hurdle people have to pass, vr sickness. Motion sickness is commonly caused because of a disconnect with the perceptions the body feels and what it sees. It could also be attributed to an over stimulus to their senses (The rocking of a boat, the rumbling of a car). Many people get VR sickness because of the disconnect of what the eye see and what the body feels or the sudden overstimulates of their senses when the character moves while the body feels like it isn\u2019t moving. This is alleviated with tunnel vision and just getting experience. There probably are more different ways to alleviate motion sickness but those are the two main ways that I have seen in VR gaming. One way to just circumnavigate it is by having a still character or teleportation. Another current hurdle that might be solved eventually is having a box strap to your head which definitely can lead to fatigue. \n\nJust to reiterate my main point, I believe video games are hard to understand to old people and those who have never touched a game but I think the intuitive nature of virtual reality would be a great way to have them enjoy gaming like the rest of us.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":90519,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I think old people would like gaming with vr","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/vlbqzv\/i_think_old_people_would_like_gaming_with_vr\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"gamepletionist","author_created_utc":1561231682,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3zpjeg7g","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1652985196,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":1652986457.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"ut9x7o","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_ut9x7o","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/ut9x7o\/need_help_with_controls_to_exit_a_boat_in\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1653935554,"retrieved_utc":1653935554,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I currently have an HP Reverb g2 and am playing vivecraft.

I am new to this subreddit so please don't be too harsh on me and my newbieness.\n\nSo, I accidentally saw this video recently https:\/\/youtu.be\/WR6hEsSuiJE  and it reminded me that VR exists. My last and only VR experience was with the GEAR VR on the galaxy S7 about 5 years ago. I thought it was amazing. The only things I could criticise didn't even have to do with the VR itself but rather with how un-ergonomic the headset was and that the phone got very hot very fast and the phone battery went from 100% to 30% in half an hour.\nGalaxy S7 had a 1440x2560 resolution which wasn't even used entirely.\nIt looked something like this: https:\/\/c.mobilegeeks.de\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/Samsung-Gear-VR-00041.jpg?mrf-size=m\n\nSo I would approximate the resolution to have been 1080x1080 per eye@60 (s7's display max.limit but I doubt the phones GPU could mentain 60fps in all games).\n\nI currently game on a RTX 3090+ R9 5900X with 32GB 3600mhz RAM combo but will upgrade to the rtx 4090 as soon as it is available (rumors point to September).\nI use 3x 27\" 1440p monitors in portrait configuration(they turn into one giant one vis NV Surround) and angled them to simulate a 1000R curvature (or it may even be 800R) but even if it's high resolution (4320x 2560) and it does fill my entire periferic view it's still not the same as my GEAR VR experience so I want to get back to VR.\n\nMy wish: I will be sitting on my gaming chair with the Headset connected to the PC and I will control the game via mouse and keyboard (or with my Xbox controller) and enjoy all the games I lik that have a VR port (red dead redemption 2, witcher 3, horizon zero dawn, cyberpunk 2077 etc).\nI do not need any hand motion controllers or the likes.\n\nWhich headset is the best?\n\nShould I wait for the Sony PSVR2 or it won't work with PC ports\/Steam anyway?\n\nOut of the question: any headset that requires a Facebook account\/login since I don't have a Facebook account and since I heard that making an account only to use the VR is not allowed, and you also have to use your real identity (my name can't just be John Dough) this is dealbreaking for me, no matter how cheap the headset is.\n\n\nPIMAX 5K\nConsidering I will ALWAYS play every game at maximum\/ultra settings my RTX 3090 is clearly still too weak, but with the upcoming 4090 I can definitely really start using it. Another argument for me is that it has LCD Displays so I don't have to worry about the longevity and theoretically even my son will be able to use it 18years from now. Also the FOV.\n\nWhat is very confusing for me is the individual platforms each headset runs on...\nSo like with PS vs Xbox , there are games you can play on one but not the other?\nCan I use the PIMAX with steamVR? \nWhat's up with base stations? Do I need them if I just want to sit on my chair and not use hand tracking? I couldn't even find base stations made by PIMAX, but if I understand correctly I NEED 2 base stations to just set-up steamVR?? Can I use base stations from other headsets then? \nThe way I see it now, I will become a Luke Ross Patreon to access his VR mods and that's how I will use the headset most of the time.\n\nI found this guide which makes everything seem very straightforward:\n\n\"That said, you will need to own a copy of the game on Steam in order to play.

I\u2019ve gotten through a few horror games but only very slowly and with lots of save spamming. I can barely get out of the first room in PT and the RE7 prologue demo. Ravenholm in HL2 is the only reason I can\u2019t bring myself to replay that game despite how much I love it.\n\nSo now I\u2019m brand new to VR and of course I know that the last thing I\u2019ll be able to handle is even more immersive horror experiences. I\u2019d heard about how scary Alyx can get, but I also wanted a polished AAA VR game to take for a spin so I grabbed it and figured I\u2019d see how far I can take it. And I\u2019m finding it waaaay less stressful to get through than pancake horror games.\n\nI mean it still gets tense and I still get spooked. Dark hallways infested with zombies and only a tiny light to see with is an unnerving situation no matter how immune to horror you are. But it\u2019s\u2026 fine? I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s because in VR, my real world reflexes actually matter and can help keep me safe in the game. I\u2019m not fighting against an unintuitive control scheme or obtuse camera angle to stay alive. I have a lot more 1:1 agency in the game world so I can get through it more confidently. \n\nGetting jump-scared and having to remember which button does what in the same instant is always a recipe for panic. Even though I\u2019ve been gaming most of my life I double check my controller buttons and keyboard keys and get my finger placement ready before going into a dark room. But in VR the interface is much more intuitive and I feel like I can just rely on my own instincts to get through hairy situations. Maybe this whole time I thought I was afraid of horror games I was actually just afraid of bad controls lol\n\nIt might also be that because VR is so immersive, it\u2019s that much easier to be reminded that it\u2019s not real. I live my real world life in the same perspective as a VR game so the seams in the game are constantly glaring at me as a reminder that it\u2019s not real. Dunno if that theory holds as much water but it could have something to do with it. Of course Alyx isn\u2019t quite on the level of a PT so maybe I\u2019m getting ahead of myself, but comparing to HL2 there\u2019s still a marked improvement in my comfort level. \n\ntl;dr\nI\u2019m usually afraid of horror games in 2D but find it much easier to do in VR, maybe because I feel like I have better agency over my movements in the game.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":88156,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Anyone else find horror less scary in VR?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.71,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/sknd9k\/anyone_else_find_horror_less_scary_in_vr\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"DeadlyRanger21","author_created_utc":1636912978,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_gjjxf602","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1642984837,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"sb8pma","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_sb8pma","no_follow":false,"num_comments":11,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/sb8pma\/missing_an_arm\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654157420,"retrieved_utc":1654157420,"score":14,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Ok, so I was born without most of my right arm.

But it is a mix of standing and seated games.\n\nI have narrowed my search down to either of these two:\n\n* HP Reverb G2\n* Occulus Quest 2 128gb\n\n**G2**I do like good clarity hence the G2 came to the table, but wondering:\n\n* would games still look better baring in my my laptop spec\n* are the controls going to be bad for something like skyrim?\n* does the cable actually get in the way? (I was thinking I could ceiling mount it in my playspace and have a shelf for the laptop)\n* Can you use it for virtual desktop and flatscreen applications? - how do you do this? I.e. say I wanted to play Age of Empires, could I? or work on some typing would it work?\n   * reason I ask is my laptop weight a ton and sometimes I will play on the sofa next to my wife. Laptop + Cooling pad and lappad does get annoying. Would love to be able to have just headset, wireless keyboard and mouse for these tasks.\n\n**Occulus**First one I was looking at because of the price.\n\n* How good is the wireless, is there limitations\n* How is the clarity for games such as racing and skyrim? I watched videos where people were saying Q2 was too blurry to read the speedo etc.\n* As above could I use it just as a screen for my PC and do normal tasks? How do I do this? Does it work wirelessly?\n* How long is the battery life? I have seen 2 hours. But realistically? and can you charge and play?\n* Wired Connection, is it better? do you use it?\n* Any difference between 64gb and 128gb except size and do you use it all? I've see a few on facebook marketplace. although some 64GB priced over a new 128gb atm :-S\n* What accessories, I have seen a lot of people say it needs a strap\n\nI do probably have more and more questions but its a start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**:UPDATE:**\n\nFollowing the advice on here and various forums I considered the Quest 2 and HP Reverb G2 and I went for the Reverb G2 - the picture quality just sold it for me, especially as I will be playing sims and skyrim a lot.\n\nThe cable hasn't bothered me at all - floor mounted and I play Skyrim on a 2x2m rug. gives me an idea of where I am. Planning on setting up in my garage with an overhead cable so I can try a bigger playspace and move around a bit more. (and not punch lapshades!)\n\nAlot of people reported issue getting G2 to work, but I just plug it in everytime and it worked. Never had a problem. Only issue I have had I believe is due a skyrim mod, but not worked out which yet. I lose sound or the game crashes. Steam VR and WMR seem fine and never have issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've had no issues with the Laptop running anything yet. I haven't even messed with any settings really.

And doesn\u2019t hurt my eyes like the rift s did. On the quest 2 that is completely gone from what I heard.\nHowever you need to also keep in mind some important little details about these two:\n\nHeadphone and mic quality on index are exceptional, with the quest 2 and rift s you have to wear headphones, not something I\u2019ve done with the index, ever. Mic quality is also important if you\u2019re playing games like vrchat, rec room or pavlov, or simply any co op game with your friend on discord\n\nIndex is way more comfortable, with the downside of being heavy, I get a mark left on my face after long sessions (+5 hours). Another upside is that you the cover is magnetic so you can easily buy another cover for around 30\u20ac and swap them when you start sweating, especially useful if you share your headset or want to let someone try it out. You also HAVE TO change the wrap on the quest two from what I heard, it\u2019s way worse than rift s\u2019s halo style band\n\nRefresh rate still matters more than resolution, more refresh rate = less motion sickness, also you won\u2019t notice it at first but it does make you a better gamer in stuff like beat saber that don\u2019t give you a motion sickness\n\nHigher resolution = less refresh rate, and also requires a more beefy gpu. \n\nI heard quest 2 got an update that overclocks it\u2019s refresh rate all the way to 120 instead of 80\u2026 absolute bullshit. Overclocking refresh rate is not true refresh rate, otherwise it would be pretty common amongst monitors. Also a usb c can\u2019t pass through that much data for the resolution and refresh rate the quest 2 supposedly offers. Don\u2019t believe what you hear\n\nThe index has much better color depth than quest 2, just google it, there\u2019s a big difference in the picture. Maybe enough to cover the resolution difference but that comes to you to choose.\n\nThe controllers; quest 2 uses the same controllers as the rift s and I know they\u2019re solid, but if you hear someone say they\u2019re better than the index\u2019s, don\u2019t believe them lmao. Although finger tracking isn\u2019t as useful in gaming, index still offers a vibration with a much higher quality, and a solid 5-6 hour battery life with a decent charging speed through usb c. Now quest two uses swappable AAs so that comes to a personal choice. Personally 6 hours is enough for me. BUT DONT FORGET THE HAPTICS, the vibration of the index are out of the world compared to quest 2. Gaming feels better on those controllers.\n\nTaking your headset off is easier on the index as well, and the pass through mode is much more clear, you can almost type in your keyboard if you distinguish the letters a little bit, they\u2019re like really cheap cameras, but still better than oculus\u2019s 2D pass through.\n \nFOV also matters, a lot.\n\nTracking is obviously better on the index as well but at a high cost\n \nNow this last one might sound weird, but the unboxing of the index is an EXPERIENCE. I\u2019m personally a fan of unboxing and index beats every Apple product I ever bought. 10\/10 and experience you won\u2019t forget\n\nBecause of the base stations you are also more future proof with the index as you can later on add full body tracking and all that stuff\n\nNow some quest 2 advantages:\n\nIt\u2019s waaaay cheaper\n\nWaaaaay less fragile ( index will break after some hundreds of hours, but valve is nice enough to always provide a replacement. Though if you\u2019re not an active user, your warranty might run out) index has record of braking in literally every way you can think of\u2026 controllers, base stations, headset, lens glue coming off, software issues etc, though mine still functions properly after almost a month and about 100 hours in\n\nMore optimization on oculus exclusive games\n\nYou can play it anywhere, without the need of base stations or even cables, could really come in handy sometimes. Especially in vr chat when you just feel lazy.\n\nYou will also need 3 power plugs for the index which is absurd compared to no power plugs needed for quest 2 (one for each base station and one for the headset itself)\n\nWaaaaaaaaay more value per $ spent. Compared to quest 2, index should cost around 600-700\u20ac tops if you\u2019re asking me\u2026\n\nYou can play it anywhere, take it to school, travel lightly with it etc\u2026 having inside out tracking is a huge advantage over the index\n\nVERDICT:\n\nQuest 2 is amazing for its value and a huge upgrade from the rift s, well worth your money. Get index only if  you constantly use vr frequently. It is an improvement over the rift s in literally every way. I am happy with my purchase but the price is absurdly high as well. Give it a big thought, honestly. They\u2019re completely different type of purchases.\n\nP.s. hp reverb 2 is also a good middle point but I don\u2019t know enough about it to mention it at all lol\n\nHope my experience helped you","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/VRGaming","subreddit_subscribers":89830,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Here\u2019s a comparison list I made for a comment after a month of index, thought It\u2019s worth a share idk","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.57,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/pi6lc8\/heres_a_comparison_list_i_made_for_a_comment\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Thatariesbloke","author_created_utc":1469357739,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_zrlhb","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1625744149,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":1625826879.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"og5e0l","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_og5e0l","no_follow":false,"num_comments":12,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/og5e0l\/vr_a_habitual_upgrade_path_casual_vr_vs_hardcore\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656214499,"retrieved_utc":1656214499,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"VR is an odd hobby that for many of us has taken on a new and exciting, and to a great extent addicting, pass time that as of 2020 and the lock-down became for many of us a way to experience some level of \"face to face\" social interaction and bring some type of normality to the four walls of life during the plague times.\n\nBut with lockdowns being somewhat lifted the \"need\" for VR for many has lessened, and yet for those of us that have been diving into virtual worlds for years this unprecedented increase in users had been a dual edged sword.  While the global insanity has brought VR significantly more into the mainstream via the Oculus Quest 1 &amp; 2 for more casual gamers and developments such as the latest generation Pimax and Vive pro 2 as well as significant development with tracking and force feedback leads to an odd situation where focus has been somewhat lost and yet this isnt exactly a \"bad\" thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my case I have been an enthusiast level VR nut since the DK1, I remember the struggle of Vorpx interaction and the first time I was able to explore Skyrim in VR and in spite of the nausea and the insanity of trying to get everything calibrated the utter joy of experiencing that world in a whole new way and showing it to friends and family is something I honestly thought would never be truly surpassed... Then I got a Dk2, then my brother got a Rift S, and I picked up an OG Vive... and the addiction took off.\n\nIn less than a decade we have gone from limited use development kits you had to beg steal and borrow to get hold of to walking into Argos and just picking up a fully stand-alone HMD with full steam VR capabilities in an easy-to-use package and interface, and it's all frankly amazing!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo with so much development and general social uptake of VR in general, do so many developers consider VR a so-called \"limited\" or even \"unprofitable\" medium, at least at a consumer level?\n\nMathematically, at least in terms of pure profit, they kinda have a point. The sad delusion that VR is an expensive and hard to get into hobby is still held by many AAA developers and to some extent we as gamers and VR enthusiasts have somewhat brought this upon ourselves although unintentionally due to our almost universal \"tinkerer\" like obsession with making our frankly often very expensive HMD's the best possible experience we can with lenses upgrades, modified straps, 3rd party software and hardware hacks that sadly makes what we do seem significantly less than mainstream.\n\nAgain enter Facebook and the Quest series and the perfect storm that was 2020 and the introduction of all in one headset's to the mainstream public. A literal iPhone of an HMD to challenge the mainstream \"nerd\" PC tethered VR community at large. And we embraced it... and we TINKERED!\n\nSo this is all great, right? We have the general public enthused with VR, we have our first real AAA title in the form of HL:Alyx and we finally have a fully fledged platform!!!... right?...right?!?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh yes, there's the rub, VR as a platform.\n\nAs I pointed out before, I love VR, I genuinely think some form of VR and to a similar extent AR is the future of gaming and productivity. Not as a platform in and of itself but as a true development of PC and to a lesser extent AR mobile gaming, and sadly that's not how it's being developed or directed. With Facebook and Oculus's and to a lesser extent Vive's insistence on a separate \"app stores\" distinct and locked away from other HMD's in order to promote only that specific platform with Steam VR being seen as an \"unfortunate requirement\" by these brand's and more importantly the always money focused development teams linked to these brands the separation of platforms as a segregation tool to focus sales is a mindset that should have been abandoned in the 80's and 90's when Nintendo and Sega were still fighting it out in the console wars.\n\nNow yes once again the 3rd party tinkers came to the rescue and with platforms such as ReVive the big Zuk has kinda had his candy shop raided and a good 90% of Oculus titles are available to all HMD's with a little bit of .exe here and .SDK there but here's the thing...why is this level of tinkering needed at all?\n\nIt could be argued that platform exclusivity can lead to development and competition and can only lead to bigger and better things...right?\n\nNot so much, VR is sadly still only a tiny fraction of a fraction of gaming and if we start to split off that fractional uptake into brand specific development that is not cross-platform orientated by default then the degrees of separation can only limit development as a whole.\n\nWe are all fully aware that if Zuckerberg could utterly separate the Quest platform from mainstream VR and promote Quest VR as a totally stand-alone platform he would and sadly with his insistence on bringing advertising to the platform as a whole there is a chance he may place a glowing neon pillow over the face of this fledging new medium just because he cannot see the wood for the trees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what now? With VR still very much taking its first steps into the mainstream and with the rapid adoption rate, does this mean that developers will take the hint and start giving us more Alyx level experiences, or will it still be treated like the weird but fun red haired step-child that you only really invite to the party because they brought lightsabers and music?\n\nFor me, it's time to stop seeing VR as an individual platform in and of itself and see it as what it should always have been, a peripheral to gaming as a whole and not a separated medium limited to Indy titles and \"experiences\" but rather be something as ubiquitous as a second monitor or a high-end keyboard and mouse and seen as just another way to experience almost any title.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this may seem insane, but back in the day that was the whole point of software like VorpX, a way to bring \"ANY\" title into VR. There needs to be a point where, when under development, an .SDK plug in could be added to any first person game that can tie into and use game assets to map to conventional VR tracking and controls.We as a community of tinker happy VR users know this is not only possible but have gone out of our way to make it a reality with a myriad of games and because of THAT some developers have taken notice that the fully rendered first-person perspective model they created for a game can in fact be mapped to a VR game with incredible ease and has led to Elite dangerous, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Doom, sea of thieves, Payday, Borderlands 2 VR and a myriad of other titles getting a specific VR release.\n\nBut what if these 1st person games didn't \"require\" a second release? What if VR was just another way to play, the same way keyboard and mouse vs game pad were?What if VR was considered just a peripheral?\n\nWe as VR users are well aware of the addictive nature of VR with many of us spending thousands to get the ideal set up and stretching our budgets to near breaking point for not only our HMD's but for better wands, hand tracking, eye tracking and facial mapping not to mention full body tracking just to get us that little bit closer to the reality of virtual reality, some even going full ready player one with things like the katwalk and other virtual treadmills and yet for all that hardware our software libraries are still comparatively sparse in spite of our monetary outlay with many limiting themselves to two or three games and world simulators such as VR chat.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that so long as bigger companies and developers see VR as individual platforms unique and separate from conventional gaming rather than a medium that should be developed alongside conventional flat screen gaming we will continue to be on the outskirts of what can be considered profitable.\n\nI mean could you imagine for one stark brilliant moment that you pick up, for example, the latest Farcry and without anything more than a small patch you can dive into the insanity with your chosen HMD and tracking solution and just PLAY!

so I saved a [link](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/miksfa\/google_earth_vr_and_cas_amdnvidia_a_whole_new\/) from this subreddit a month ago explaining how to make Google Earth look nicer, I gave it a go yesterday and I was amazingly impressed with it, and I tried it with other VR games and I felt like this deserved it own thread here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCAS (Contrast Adaptive Sharpener) mod makes a lot of games look nicer through clever use of shaders, and it makes games sharper without any major drawbacks, and while a lot of games benefit from this, it doesn't work with all.  Please note that this may have been updated since, so if anyone can explain in detail more about reshader, please let others know anything else I've not mentioned in this thread.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a GTX 1660 ti, mid-range graphics cards, and its made a big difference.  If you have a higher end card, you might be able to drop the quality after this for higher fps, but you can look into that later:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you want an example try checking out this screenshot from [Fallout 4](https:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/fallout4\/mods\/48934).  Try and look between screenshot 1 &amp; screenshot 2 for non-CAS and CAS differences (don't look at the left\/right eye sockets)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Please note that since this is editing a game's files, it could count as a fake hack when playing online games (Like battleye) so I recommend not doing this for certain games that use programs like this to search for cheaters, keep it single player or casual multiplayer games**\n\n**-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst you download this mod for VR Skyrim, don't worry it works for all VR available games that benefit from this (you will need to register, it's all good, I've done it before for Subnautica VR mod):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/skyrimspecialedition\/mods\/46999\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen extract all the files in the zip in your root directory of your game file (where the exe is), so in your Steam folder find \"...Steam\/steamapps\/common\/GAMENAME\" and drop the files in there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt should be 4 files called \"reshade-shaders\" folder, \"Reshade\" &amp; \"Reshade Preset \"config setting, and \"dxgi.dll\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLoad up the game and it should be good to go!  If you're uncertain if its working, check the top left of your screen on your monitor and it should say the shader mod has been installed, or press the \"HOME\" button on your keyboard and check your monitor and it should bring up the reshader options screen.  Some VR headsets have \"monitor\" mode built into them, so you can check it this way instead of leaning over and removing your VR headset.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you ever want these features removed, just delete the four files (sometimes dxgi.dll creates a notepad file, you can delete that as well) and your game is back to normal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can toggle the \"END\" key on your keyboard to turn off\/on the effects within the game if you need to see the differences yourself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's my current game list that this works for, please feel free to add workable games to this.  If the game has (Win64) next to it, you may need to drop the 4 files into it's Win64 folder app instead to make it work.  Games marked with (+) are my personal favourite changes.  Please note that CAS is not perfect, as some changes might be too bright or saturated and may not be required, but in most cases it improves your experience to the better.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**1943 Berlin Blitz**\n\n**Against Demo**\n\n**Aircar** (I think this is the only game that did not benefit from the changes, try it for yourself)\n\n**Beat Saber** (might require a high framerate to make the effects less distracting)\n\n**Bigscreen Beta (+)**\n\n**Blade Runner 9732**\n\n**Blueplanet VR demo**\n\n**Boneworks**\n\n**Borderlands 2 VR (Win64)**\n\n**Budget Cuts (+)**\n\n**Cards &amp; Tankards (+)**\n\n**Conscious Existence - A Journey Within** (I don't think helped this experience, not recommended)\n\n**Creed: Rose to Glory (Win64)**\n\n**Davigo (demo)**\n\n**Final Assault (+)**\n\n**FORM (demo)**\n\n**Google Earth (+)** (Please note for this game you must rename \"dxgi.dll\" to \"opengl32.dll\" for it to work)\n\n**GORN**\n\n**GRIP: Combat Racing (+)**\n\n**Holopoint**\n\n**Home - A VR Spacewalk (Win64)**\n\n**Hover Junkers**\n\n**Horizon Vanguard (Win64)**\n\n**In Death (Win64)**\n\n**Iron Rebellion (demo)**\n\n**Job Simulator (+)**\n\n**The Lab (+)**\n\n**Moss**\n\n**Nightstar Alliance (+)**\n\n**No Clue VR**\n\n**Pavlov VR (Win64)**\n\n**Pokerstars VR (+?)** (please note that the start-up logo has messed up colours, but ingame it looks fantastic!)\n\n**Project Wingman (Win64)**\n\n**Raw Data (Win64)**\n\n**Redout: Enhanced Edition**\n\n**Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality**\n\n**Serious Sam VR: The First Encounter**\n\n**A Shopping Trip To Eklan Tor**\n\n**Smashbox Arena (+)**\n\n**SportsBar VR (Win64)**\n\n**Sprint Vector (Win64)**\n\n**Star Trek: Bridge Crew**\n\n**Subnautica**\n\n**Superhot VR**\n\n**Surge (Win64)**\n\n**Swords of Gurrah**\n\n**Tiltbrush (+)**\n\n**Until You Fall**\n\n**The Walking Dead: Saint &amp; Sinners (+) (Win64)**\n\n**VRChat (+?)** (please note with so many worlds, some changes might not be for the better)\n\n**Zero Caliber VR (Win64)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's a list of games that don't work, or have not been able to get working yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Accounting**\n\n**Alien Isolation**\n\n**Battle Dome**\n\n**Compound**\n\n**Cooking Simulator VR (beta)**\n\n**Doom 1\/2 (classic)**\n\n**Doom 3 BFG Fully Possessed**\n\n**Elite Dangerous**\n\n**Eye of the Temple (demo)**\n\n**The Forest**\n\n**Google Spotlight Stories animation (any)**\n\n**Half Life: Alyx**\n\n**I Expect You To Die**\n\n**Onward**\n\n**Quake VR**\n\n**Project Cars 1**\n\n**Sairento VR**\n\n**Scanner Sombre**\n\n**Space Pirate Trainer**\n\n**Star Wars Squadrons**\n\n**The Blu**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_subscribers":61725,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Have you tried CAS (Contrast Adaptive Sharpener) mod? - It makes your graphics sharper with no performance issues","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.73,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/nb4oeb\/have_you_tried_cas_contrast_adaptive_sharpener\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"peanutlobber","author_created_utc":1516150171,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_plyw28h","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1619930232,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"n2z5y6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#349e48","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_n2z5y6","no_follow":false,"num_comments":7,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/n2z5y6\/day_one_vr_experience\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623488294,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Recently purchased and received a custom PC from a super cool, local PC Builder.

No I don\u2019t have a very complicated question. \n\nStory time! You see I have recently upgraded my PC and with it I decided to do the same to some other stuff. I got a new monitor and keyboard along with a few other things. But I didn\u2019t feel the need to upgrade my headset since despite being a basic vive, it still works great! \n\nWhat I actually decided to replace or will replace is the controllers. Story time over.\n\nNow some of you have no doubt used the vive wands before and if you have... I am so sorry. It\u2019s no secret that the vive wands while sleek, are very... not good. From button placement to the trackpads just breaking if used to much. Not great. Like the joy cons of the VR world...\n\nThe most baffling thing I think is that they seem to be the only ones who made such a weird design for their controllers. Meanwhile every other company is following a pretty standard design.  A trigger, two buttons and a thumb stick. Maybe a grip or something but that\u2019s about it. It\u2019s a controller that makes sense. Which leads to my Q and hopefully, your A... don\u2019t think about what I just said.\n\nQ: I am seeking out a new pair of controllers but cannot decide as there\u2019s like 50 alternatives to the vive wands. So what would one recommend?  \n\nI\u2019ve looked at index controllers but outside of the grips being pretty neat they don\u2019t seem to have anything that other (cheaper) models don\u2019t have. Plus as I just said, the price seems a bit high. \n\nI\u2019ve also looked at oculus stuff but I\u2019ve heard weird stuff about them as a company so I\u2019ve held off for now. But I\u2019m open if they work well.\n\nAnyway I\u2019m rambling. I figured a group called \u201cVRgaming\u201d could help me in my time of \u201cneed\u201d, so...\n\nTLDR, whatever that means, what controllers would one go with as a replacement for the vive wands.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"VRGaming","subreddit_id":"t5_2x5up","subreddit_subscribers":61700,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hardware question.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/ma6p1u\/hardware_question\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"rackyoweights","author_created_utc":1468535158,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_zihlx","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1614156509,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.VRGaming","edited":1614156802.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"lr7zdc","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#0aa18f","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a7d0720e-0b37-11e6-89e8-0e5a369078cf","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_lr7zdc","no_follow":false,"num_comments":45,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/VRGaming\/comments\/lr7zdc\/i_have_given_up_on_conventional_gaming\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623399164,"score":15,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Seriously.\n\nI've been on the knife edge of adopting VR since Palmer came to fame.\n\nBut for various reasons I haven't pulled the trigger.\n\nUntil last Friday in which I spent 4 hours playing HL Alyx (longtime HL fan) on a fully wireless setup (backpack MSI rig &amp; HTC vive pro).
