All of these will be dynamically selected, customized for each individual user and then integrated into existing content without the need for human intervention in order to maximize revenue.\n\nUser perks will include providing individuals with the chance to interact with content creators, either to an AI model of them or directly for an extra fee. Interactions will include speaking, gestures, having the content creator change clothes or accessories, compelling the creator to perform a specific task, and more. \n\nAd placements will be made and perks will be offered for purchase to users at the optimal time, in the optimal fashion, determined by the vast amount of information collected by headsets, including gaze, respiration rate, heart rate, pupil dilation, facial gestures, blood flow sensors that detect blushing, and more.\n\nThe biofeedback during experiences will be used to optimize selection and customization of experiences ensuring optimal retention, spending and advertisement influence.\n\nThanks to our partnership with the Department of Corrections, large-scale testing has not only been stunningly affordable, but has enabled much more thorough testing with much higher confidence in the results than would be possible testing with the general public. \n\nWhile most user spending revenue from existing content platforms is from a small number of big spenders, our tests have shown that users are much more willing to spend money on Content Nexus experiences, with most devoting a far larger percentage of their disposable income to Content Nexus transactions than other platforms.

I currently use a Rift S. My PC is fairly powerful (5800X3D, RTX 4090 Suprim Liquid, 3200MHz CL14 DDR4) so it should be able to handle most headsets. This would be used exclusively for PCVR, so built in mobile\/portable gaming\/VR isn't a requirement.\n\n---\n\nIf I'm going to upgrade, there are a few things I I'm not willing to compromise on:\n\n-OLED or Local Dimming LCD are very important to me. I'd like to move away from the washed out black levels of the Rift S.\n\n-Wider FOV. The Rift S has a severely limited FOV, probably most headsets these days are much better. This would be very helpful for sim racing and flying. \n\n-No (visible) compression artifacts. I'd generally prefer direct displayport input, but if it must be compressed I'd like the compression to be effectively unnoticeable.\n\n-Some kind of passthrough. Not for AR, but simply for quickly checking my surroundings without needing to take off the headset. If it looks better than the grainy grayscale of the Rift S that would be great, but it's not the main priority.\n\n-Ability to play plugged in for power. It's fine if it needs to have a battery built in, but I don't want to have to stop using the headset if the battery gets low, so I'd like it to be usable while plugged in to power it as well. \n\n-Roomscale tracking. I want to be able to play any kind of VR game\/experience, including Room Scale.\n\n-Not totally bank breaking. I can live with it being a bit pricy if needed, but I'd like to not spend multiple thousands of dollars. Around $1000 to $1500 is about where I'm looking at the upper end (cheaper than that would be great if available as well). I'm somewhat flexible, but again I don't want to break the bank. \n\n-Silicone or other type of easily cleanable face interface. Fine with it being third party if needed. I currently have silicone covers for my Rift S that make it very easy to wipe away sweat during use. Sweaty foam is gross. \n\nThings I'd prefer, but aren't hard requirements:\n\n-Inside Out tracking. I'd prefer not to have to set up base stations if possible. I can if needed, but this won't be a dedicated VR setup, I use it for many other things including work, music production, so it needs to be adaptable and relatively easy to hook up and disconnect. \n\n-Option for prescription lens inserts. I currently need to use glasses with my Rift S. If I can order prescription inserts to be able to use without my glasses that would be preferable. If not, it must work well while wearing glasses. \n\n-Replacable batteries in the controllers \n\n-Higher resolution. I've been living with the Rift S resolution, so I'm not terribly bothered by the screen door effect, but higher resolution would be nice. \n\n-I'm fine with a cable if it means better visuals and no visible compression.\n\n---\n\nFrom my research so far, the ones that come closest to what I'm looking for are:\n\n-Pimax Crystal. It seems to do just about everything I want, but it's definitely expensive. \n\n-Bigscreen Beyond. My main concern with this is the lack of inside out tracking. Otherwise it looks really good.\n\n-Quest Pro. Pretty close to what I want, though I'm a bit worried about getting a headset that's over a year old at this point, and it seems outdated in many aspects compared to Quest 3.\n\n---\n\nIn truth, the Quest 3 is what I would probably choose if it weren't for the lack of OLED\/Local Dimming LCD, given the features for the price. At this point I'm almost willing to compromise on this point given how good the Quest 3 seems to be. If anyone can convince me the black levels on the Quest 3 aren't that big of a deal I might go that route, but if there's an option (including the 3 above) that's better, I'd love to hear about it!","author_fullname":"t2_rj4gt","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Been out of the loop for a while, looking for recommendations on an upgrade from my Rift S","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Purchase Advice - Headset"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/virtualreality","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18xqg1c","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Purchase Advice - Headset","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1704307242.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.virtualreality","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m considering a new VR setup.

Fine with it being third party if needed. I currently have silicone covers for my Rift S that make it very easy to wipe away sweat during use. Sweaty foam is gross. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things I&amp;#39;d prefer, but aren&amp;#39;t hard requirements:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Inside Out tracking. I&amp;#39;d prefer not to have to set up base stations if possible. I can if needed, but this won&amp;#39;t be a dedicated VR setup, I use it for many other things including work, music production, so it needs to be adaptable and relatively easy to hook up and disconnect. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Option for prescription lens inserts. I currently need to use glasses with my Rift S. If I can order prescription inserts to be able to use without my glasses that would be preferable. If not, it must work well while wearing glasses. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Replacable batteries in the controllers &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Higher resolution. I&amp;#39;ve been living with the Rift S resolution, so I&amp;#39;m not terribly bothered by the screen door effect, but higher resolution would be nice. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;m fine with a cable if it means better visuals and no visible compression.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr\/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my research so far, the ones that come closest to what I&amp;#39;m looking for are:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Pimax Crystal. It seems to do just about everything I want, but it&amp;#39;s definitely expensive. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Bigscreen Beyond. My main concern with this is the lack of inside out tracking. Otherwise it looks really good.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Quest Pro. Pretty close to what I want, though I&amp;#39;m a bit worried about getting a headset that&amp;#39;s over a year old at this point, and it seems outdated in many aspects compared to Quest 3.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr\/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In truth, the Quest 3 is what I would probably choose if it weren&amp;#39;t for the lack of OLED\/Local Dimming LCD, given the features for the price. At this point I&amp;#39;m almost willing to compromise on this point given how good the Quest 3 seems to be. If anyone can convince me the black levels on the Quest 3 aren&amp;#39;t that big of a deal I might go that route, but if there&amp;#39;s an option (including the 3 above) that&amp;#39;s better, I&amp;#39;d love to hear about it!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1a07db2c-92d1-11ee-affb-eaef35dacaa8","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qp9o","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"18xqg1c","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"NonPrime","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/18xqg1c\/been_out_of_the_loop_for_a_while_looking_for\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/18xqg1c\/been_out_of_the_loop_for_a_while_looking_for\/","subreddit_subscribers":922166,"created_utc":1704307242.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"virtualreality","selftext":"I was looking into getting a VR headset but I'm kind of lost on the technical specs part\n\nI have a HP Envy 17\" laptop with  Windows 11 Home, Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, and a discrete NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce RTX\u2122 3050 but I'm not entirely sure whether or not it would work.\n\nHP says that it has\n\n(3) USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports;

But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.","author_fullname":"t2_a7mpw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Towers and Powers Review!","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (YouTuber)"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/virtualreality","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18suo40","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (YouTuber)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703772316.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.virtualreality","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM\"&gt;https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate it if you would give my video a watch, I give some pretty good examples in it to help give you an idea of what this game is like.

Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it&amp;#39;s just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn&amp;#39;t help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you&amp;#39;re looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

table (Google Sheets spreadsheet) of various head-mounted displays with &gt;= 1080p resolution and &gt;= 25 PPD. Some of these devices are intended primary for VR (high FOV \/ high distortion), others are meant to act like a head-worn monitor \/ TV \/ theatre screen (low FOV \/ low distortion), some of these are meant for FPV purposes (quadcopter \/ RC plane \/ etc.).\n\n1. There may be errors. Please let me know if you find any. It was often unclear if the manufacturer-specified FOV was diagonal or horizontal, usually I was able to work this out by calculating average PPD both ways, and seeing which one looked more likely. Oh, and apparently sometimes the given FOV is for both eyes, but I've been assuming it's for one eye, so that may also be a source of error. I'm also not taking into account rotated displays (diamond instead of square), and I'm assuming square pixels.\n2. For devices with low FOV \/ low distortion, PPD is going to be fairly consistent across the display (like a conventional monitor), but for a device intended for VR, the stated PPD is generally (as far as I can tell) an average over an undisclosed circular area in the center of each eye, probably somewhere between 10\u00ba-40\u00ba, but I don't really know.\n3. \"K factor\" (column `F`) is based on 1920x1080 = 1K, 3840x2160 = 4K. Calculated as a simple `x*y` pixel count, which in some cases is glossing over the complexities of the visible display area -- high FOV \/ high distortion VR devices generally have the display corners cut off by pincushion distortion.\n4. Column `K` show the average PPD, rather naively calculated as the average of `horizontal resolution \/ horizontal FOV` and `vertical resolution \/ vertical FOV` (`=(B9\/H9+C9\/I9)\/2`). This number isn't necessarily that meaningful for high FOV \/ high distortion VR devices. As mentioned above I'm assuming square pixels, e.g. when calculating X &amp; Y FOV from diagonal FOV, so generally these two numbers (x &amp; y PPD) are the same.\n5. Columns `L` &amp; `M` (`Avg-` &amp; `Avg+`) are showing what the average PPD would be if the actual diagonal FOV was plus or minus 0.5 (`=B9\/(COS(ATAN(C9\/B9))*(G9+0.5))`). This is based on diagonal FOV as this spreadsheet started with \"AR\" glasses which seem to primarily provide diagonal FOV, I'll try to update this column to use horizontal FOV when that's the manufacturer-provided spec.\n6. Columns `N` &amp;`O` show the IPD range, when known. Whenever possible, I used the actual range, not the optimistically wider \"probably fine\" range, e.g. the Quest 3 might be fine for a range of 53-75 (according to Meta), but it only actually adjusts from 58-70, so outside of that range is going to be a compromise.\n7. Columns `Q`-`W` show the viewing distance at which a given display would have the same PPD in the center, as a reference. Some of these are displays I have access to, and others are displays I thought might be common. Note that my calculations differ slightly from https:\/\/qasimk.io\/screen-ppd\/ -- I haven't worked out why yet, but it may be just because I'm only calculating the PPD of the central 2\u00ba portion of the display, and PPD increases as you move away from the center on a flat display, as the distance from your eye increases. The formula I'm using is `$AA13\/(O$4\/(O$3*COS(ATAN(O$5\/O$4))))\/TAN(RADIANS(1))`, which is target PPD \/ (reference horizontal resolution \/ (reference diagonal size in inches \\* cosine(arctangent(reference vertical resolution \/ reference horizontal resolution)))) \/ tangent(1\u00ba). Note that there are significant differences between a head-mounted display and other types of displays, see https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/ (mentioned again further down) for the gory details.\n8. To add more reference devices (after making a copy of the spreadsheet so you can modify it), unhide rows `3`, `4` &amp; `5`.\n9. There's a lot of important information not included in this spreadsheet, e.g. display type, binocular overlap, brightness, etc. I was tempted to keep going, but tried to keep this focused on the topic of PPD.\n\nSee also https:\/\/risa2000.github.io\/hmdgdb\/ for tested FOV values.\n\nLong series focusing on Apple Vision Pro, covers some very important obstacles to reading text in a VR headset with current production hardware (at any price point): https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/\n\nhttp:\/\/doc-ok.org\/?tag=lens-distortion\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iJ0TV2jgNoc\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=culu6EjIIog\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B7qrgrrHry0","author_fullname":"t2_738twhsq","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"PPD-focused table of various head-mounted displays with &gt;= 1080p resolution and &gt;= 25 PPD","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/virtualreality","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18sfi3i","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703722035.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.virtualreality","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_Af6j8Qxzl3MSHf0qfpjHM9PA-NdxAzxujZesZUyBs0\/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1_Af6j8Qxzl3MSHf0qfpjHM9PA-NdxAzxujZesZUyBs0\/edit?usp=sharing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PPD-focused table (Google Sheets spreadsheet) of various head-mounted displays with &amp;gt;= 1080p resolution and &amp;gt;= 25 PPD.

Note that there are significant differences between a head-mounted display and other types of displays, see &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/\"&gt;https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/&lt;\/a&gt; (mentioned again further down) for the gory details.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;To add more reference devices (after making a copy of the spreadsheet so you can modify it), unhide rows &lt;code&gt;3&lt;\/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;\/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;5&lt;\/code&gt;.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of important information not included in this spreadsheet, e.g. display type, binocular overlap, brightness, etc. I was tempted to keep going, but tried to keep this focused on the topic of PPD.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/risa2000.github.io\/hmdgdb\/\"&gt;https:\/\/risa2000.github.io\/hmdgdb\/&lt;\/a&gt; for tested FOV values.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Long series focusing on Apple Vision Pro, covers some very important obstacles to reading text in a VR headset with current production hardware (at any price point): &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/\"&gt;https:\/\/kguttag.com\/tag\/apple-vision-pro\/&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http:\/\/doc-ok.org\/?tag=lens-distortion\"&gt;http:\/\/doc-ok.org\/?tag=lens-distortion&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iJ0TV2jgNoc\"&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iJ0TV2jgNoc&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=culu6EjIIog\"&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=culu6EjIIog&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B7qrgrrHry0\"&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B7qrgrrHry0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b2c3e456017d062a390f93e6438ac914a6ebb2a0","width":1200,"height":630},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7ac7df7c6d6247511e3e5d3ead40125c2930e5","width":108,"height":56},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee4bc06a88abe9d9f3628b1f921d6c54e88e0055","width":216,"height":113},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a304036da34c0731c54de0e575ae05954d7796de","width":320,"height":168},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=329adf6e43385244b22eb181919d2f5e620bc12f","width":640,"height":336},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9d9c832dffe2e68b85b3fb1704eb6afd464938e","width":960,"height":504},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DCPFGqOse9F4d8dvPgF3grK-g0CyFBvpvcknXigZ70M.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d085f06f0a83d7368fa224b3e373f6a0e70b8706","width":1080,"height":567}],"variants":{},"id":"nA88B0eW2wTWmH0xgRsFguWK6k3LsDQ3Iq61bmVUamA"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"35ed7f94-9fc5-11e9-9903-0e29179645cc","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qp9o","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"18sfi3i","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Finger_Stream","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/18sfi3i\/ppdfocused_table_of_various_headmounted_displays\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/18sfi3i\/ppdfocused_table_of_various_headmounted_displays\/","subreddit_subscribers":909674,"created_utc":1703722035.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"virtualreality","selftext":"Hey, ive been playing into the radius for a while and absolutely loved it, can anyone recommend me some nice \\*survival\\* games that are somehow alike?

In either case, here are my quick thoughts on the 22 games I played from September through October 2023.\n\n*TLDR: My top 5 games to check out from this list are at the bottom and so is some info for a game giveaway.*\n\n## Games Played In September\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Track Craft (Demo)\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/10038131272867316\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** Hot Wheels inspired racing with an extremely generous demo.\n\n**From the store:** Ready to take a joyride down memory lane? Our mixed reality game for the Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro brings back the childhood thrill of playing with cars with a twist. Craft your own racing tracks, share them with friends, and compete in high-speed races in a fully immersive environment. This demo version contains a demo track pack containing 20 levels, three cars, and a track editor to challenge your creativity.\n\n**My thoughts:** This is a very generous demo of a Hot Wheels style car racing game that has shades of [Stunt Track Builder VR](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4397519526943470\/), but with its own unique take on it. While I didn\u2019t find the track building as easy as in Stunt Track Builder VR, it has a campaign with time trials to beat, a variety of vehicles that handle differently, and user created levels that can keep you quite busy for hours. This is a generous free demo and I can\u2019t wait to see how the full version shakes out. Absolutely give it a go if you like Hot Wheels or racing.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### I Expect you to Die 3: Cog in the Machine\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4676322075753574\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2296380\/I_Expect_You_To_Die_3_Cog_in_the_Machine\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick take:** A master-class in escape room games.\n\n**From the store:** Outwit your most cunning adversary to date in the latest installment of this popular, spy-themed puzzle series. Wield new gadgets, visit action-packed locales, and wear custom disguises as you dive back into the world of espionage in this escape room game.\n\n**My thoughts:** This escape room game is a culmination of ideas, talent and creativity from the first two IEYTD games (three if you count [Home Sweet Home](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4751810638214255\/)) that were all put into this title. The intro alone is worth the price of admission. With a great story, collectibles and reasons to go back to get the best score, or unlock achievements, this puzzle game has legs. This exceptional game continues to deliver smart puzzles and takes the franchise in different directions that I won\u2019t spoil here. Give this one a go if you want to express your inner James Bond.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Poly Ego\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5860797560692158\/?utm_source=www.google.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2463490\/Poly_Ego\/) $14.99 [Demo](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6667623289970181\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** Budget Portal - in a good way\n\n**From the store:** So, you've got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism? Fancy getting your digital head messed with in an uncanny world where logic is king and folly is your only solace? Well, dear misfit, step right up to Poly Ego. In the infinite space, you become an unsuspecting lab rat - well, lab robot, to be more precise. Thrust into a reality that teeters between \"oh, that's clever\" and \"why the hell am I doing this?\", you must navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles, all while a robot named Bluepy keeps you company - and sometimes drives you mad.\n\n**My thoughts:** I started off by playing the demo of this clearly Portal inspired game. I\u2019m not going to lie, the movement is not terribly intuitive and frankly tough to get used to. With a bit more polish, it could be a solid Portal-style game. While the game clearly wears its inspiration on its sleeve, it does lack the fine tuning that many games have. That being said, I found myself playing through the entire demo, slowly learning the controls and made my way to the end. I thought \u201cwell, with some more polish, I wonder how a full game might look.\u201d I then noticed they had a full game out. I'm 30 out of 40 levels in and am having quite a good time despite all my concerns. I've ran into game breaking bug, and the dev is quick to fix them. There are problems with this game, but the smart puzzles keep pulling me back. If you're a Portal fan, give the demo a try for sure.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Trivia Crack VR\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6709385002410356\/) $9.99\n\n**My quick take:** There\u2019s a lot of potential in this trivia game, but give it some time to develop.\n\n**From the store:** This is a place full of fun and curiosity, where you can share your knowledge with others and prove that you are worthy of becoming the future director of the park. You'll be able to compete in trivia matches and mini-games with people from all around the world or play on your own and beat your own high scores.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game feels like it's in early access, and I\u2019d only recommend playing with friends currently. There is clearly a lot of work left to do in this game as it\u2019s a bare bones 5-player trivia game with wildly inconsistent questions ranging from easy (What is Sponge Bob\u2019s favorite food?) to very specific (What is the smallest island in the Galapagos?). I really think this will be a winner once they flesh out avatars, question difficulty and offer more modes and settings. Let this cook for a couple of months unless you\u2019re dying for some VR trivia. I had a chance to chat with the developers and they really want to make a go of this on the main store, so they are committed to improvements. and it will stay on my Quest as a warmup game with friends.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Call of the Sea VR\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5174697242548672\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/agecheck\/app\/1042490\/) $19.99\n\n**My quick take:** The captivating story pulls you through this solid puzzle adventure.\n\n**From the store:** Call of the Sea VR is an otherworldly tale of mystery and love, set in the 1930s South Pacific. You\u2019ll explore a lush island paradise, solve puzzles and unlock secrets in refreshing new ways with Meta Quest. Go on the hunt for your husband\u2019s missing expedition as Norah Everhart, fully voice-acted by Cissy Jones (Firewatch, The Walking Dead: Season 1), and take in the beautiful sights of a cryptic land, uncovering occult mysteries and venturing through forgotten ruins.\n\n**My thoughts:** This puzzle adventure game kept me intrigued and scratching my head a few times. Not terribly difficult, and not technically impressive, I did find the story very unique and the environments varied. I didn\u2019t run into any glitches - a key in puzzle games, but I did find the hint system to be a bit too generous at times. If you haven\u2019t had your fill of puzzle games, I\u2019d suggest this one for the story and quality voice acting. At roughly 5-7 hours of gameplay, it\u2019s one you can sink your teeth into.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### FTD: Find the Difference\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6055957821167625\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** A bit too clunky despite a lot of content.\n\n**From the store:** Welcome to an enchanting world where your keen observation skills and VR technology intertwine to create a captivating gaming experience. Prepare yourself for an exciting journey through 18 distinct room types, ranging from a delightful bakery to a thrilling arcade and a warm living room. Your mission in this immersive VR game is to detect the differences between two versions of each room, using your visual acuity, memory, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game was $15 and then it went free. While you could do worse on the app store, I just didn\u2019t find the experience polished enough to keep playing. There are a lot of levels here to keep you busy finding the difference between environments, and with different difficulty levels if this one speaks to you, you\u2019ll get some good game time out of it. For me though, it just didn\u2019t click and I\u2019d only recommend it for those fans of the genre.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Mini Golf Aeons\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/en-gb\/experiences\/4881013271998328\/) Free w\/full game IAP \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2335950\/Mini_Golf_Aeons__Full_Game\/) $11.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** The third best mini golf game I\u2019ve played on Quest\n\n**From the store:** Get ready for the ultimate VR mini golf adventure with Mini Golf Aeons! Explore four distinct and exciting worlds, including a desert landscape, an ocean view, a prehistoric jungle, and a frozen Antarctic wonderland. Each world features beautifully designed and challenging courses that are based on real-life greens, ensuring a truly immersive and authentic experience.\n\n**My thoughts:** I\u2019ve played a bunch of mini golf games on the Quest, and this is the third best I\u2019ve played. It will soon be the second when Golf+ removes their mini golf game. While this isn\u2019t going to replace Walkabout Mini Golf, it\u2019s doing it's own thing and going for a more realistic environment than WMG. A bit clunky and slow (you have to wait a few seconds to putt until you hear a bell), I didn\u2019t get into a good flow after the first course (9 holes). The putting did feel pretty solid though. It was quite close to feeling like real life - with a few tweaks still needed in my opinion. The demo didn\u2019t compel me to buy the full game, but I\u2019d certainly keep an eye out because it really is close to being very a very solid game.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Yupitergrad 2: The Lost Station\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4446075785447064\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969000\/Yupitergrad_2_The_Lost_Station\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A Metroidvania style game that loses steam halfway in.\n\n**From the store:** Epic action-adventure is back. Yupitergrad 2 raises the stakes. Check out the refined movement and combat system, evade obstacles, and see what surprises the new space journey will bring. Taste new challenges, use new items &amp; discover the secret of the abandoned base. It's a mix of arcade, parkour, and puzzles, Metroidvania style. It's an experience that has never been deeply explored in VR before.\n\n**My thoughts:** I was really excited to play this sequel. I quite enjoyed the first game. The swinging gameplay and physics were spot on, and more of the same sounded good - with the added benefit of a Metroidvania style game. While the core gameplay was still solid, much to my disappointment, the upgrades and game itself quickly lost my interest. Halfway through, the constant back and forth of exacting platforming grew to be quite the chore. With most Metroidvania games, you open up a new secret path to avoid a lot of backtracking, but that is not the case with this game, you're stuck taking the long road back again, and again. While I did finish it, and the story was fun, the game didn\u2019t have the same pizazz as the first. Honestly, I\u2019d skip this one, and if you haven\u2019t played either, absolutely go with the first as it has a lot more content to keep you busy.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### EarthQuest\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6320120764784270\/) $4.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** An app that tries hard to be [Google Earth](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/348250\/Google_Earth_VR\/) on Quest\n\n**From the store:** Street View Integration: I'm thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level. Single Player Mode: I've implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience. It's optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).\n\n**My thoughts:** Considering the limitations of the Quest and all the data that Google Earth is calling for, this is an impressive app. It\u2019s certainly not as good as Google Earth on Steam proper, but if you don\u2019t have access to that, this is the second best option. While a bit clunky to navigate, slow to load at times, and not as graphically impressive, EarthQuest is something fun to experiment and play with. If this is something that interests you even mildly, you could do worse for $4.99. Give it a try, but know that there are some real limitations.\n\n## October\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Eye of the Temple\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5361030930653377\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/589940\/Eye_of_the_Temple\/) $19.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** An interesting example of a room-scale game.\n\n**From the store:** Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand. This game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m.\n\n**My thoughts:** I wanted to give this room-scale game the best chance for success. I went into my garage and had a nice wide open area to experience traversing the game world. From the image and description, I thought \"who doesn\u2019t want to pretend to be Indiana Jones collecting treasure and whipping enemies?\" Well, it wasn\u2019t like that at all. While the room-scale movement was very functional, the game play of collecting gems and struggling to get my whip working correctly was just not that engaging. I put in a decent amount of time with this, but going back and forth to figure out a puzzle and having to wait for the environment to give you the opportunity to move on, via moving blocks was time consuming and quickly lost my interest. If you have the room space and the idea of room scale gaming sounds interesting, it may be your cup of tea, but honestly, I would recommend you try out the [Tea for God](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3762343440541585\/) demo on Quest for a bit more action, or [traVRsal](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3381040775329400\/) for some real walking around at your own pace.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Killer Frequency\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4629225960449550\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1903620\/Killer_Frequency\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A creepy fun time where you can live out your radio dj dreams.\n\n**From the store:** The year is 1987, and as the clock strikes midnight in small-town Gallows Creek, USA, former big city radio DJ Forrest Nash is live on air in what will turn out to be the graveyard shift of a lifetime. In this horror comedy, you must solve puzzles to save callers from being hunted down by a mysterious killer. Where every call is life and death, can you save the inhabitants of Gallows Creek?\n\n**My thoughts:** This is a really unique game that I quite enjoyed most of the way through. Paced appropriately, you\u2019ll work your way through saving citizens from a killer that\u2019s loose on the streets via phone calls. While you don\u2019t have a lot of freedom in the game, the game has a story to tell and guides you deftly through multiple puzzles that are different and interesting. I had a good time messing around with the dj equipment and exploring the radio station as it opened up as the game progressed. The game was certainly creepy and tense at times, but not overtly horror filled. I did lose some steam at the end, but saw it through. You can replay the game to try and save (or kill) more citizens, but a lack of fast forward\/skipping scenes put me off from that.\u00a0 Also, since it was so tightly scripted, I wished that there would have been some interactions with callers or my co-host when I pressed sound board buttons, or played music. Overall, a unique game that is absolutely worth a look if the trailer interests you.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Dungeons of Eternity\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6341779295861881\/) $29.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** One of the best games on the Quest, especially if you have a friend or two.\n\n**From the store:** When a cataclysmic cosmic event threatens your homeworld, the only hope for survival lies within the endless labyrinth of dungeons on the forsaken planet known as Eternity. Hack-n-slash takes on a new meaning in VR: swing swords, throw axes, use bows, wield magic staffs, and more to make it out alive. With the power of VR, you will be immersed in a fantasy adventure like no other.\n\n**My thoughts:** This co-op dungeon crawler has a gameplay loop that is supremely satisfying. With randomly generated rooms that change a few times every hour, you and your buddies will have a new adventure to play each time. The amount of loot, cosmetics and camaraderie that you get from each run gives you a sense of satisfaction that I rarely see from games on Quest. This is the type of game where you finish a run and just want to play one more time. With minimal bugs, a thriving Discord community and new items being added often, now is the time to jump into this one. Solo is good, but co-op is really where the fun is at - talking about what path to take, reviving your fallen warriors and sharing the joy of new loot is incredible. Seldom have I seen a game this polished at launch, and it's only gotten better. Pick this one up for sure.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Time Stall\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/2055554051161375\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A fun puzzle game with a frozen-in-time twist that has playful characters.\n\n**From the store:** Welcome aboard the Fantastic Leap, Earth's only crowdfunded, luxury escape craft! As the only human serving alongside a robotic crew, your job is to keep the ship safe using TIME STALL, the ship's time-bending safety protocol. When disaster strikes, Time Stall temporarily freezes time aboard the ship, allowing you to manipulate objects, divert projectiles and combine various objects\u2026whatever it takes to save the ship and her Captain from destruction!\n\n**My thoughts:** This was a unique puzzle game with the catch being that time slowed for the objects around you giving you a limited amount of time to to solve the problem by manipulating items around the environment. Each puzzle was unique and interesting, but the extra hidden objectives for each level weren\u2019t enough to keep me around replaying it after I finished. A shorter game for sure, but the unique premise is enough for me to recommend it. The fun and quirky characters and playful interactions you can have were well thought out. Just don\u2019t go in expecting a multiple hour adventure.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### First Encounters\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6236169136472090\/) Free\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A neat free adventure to try out mixed reality.\n\n**From the store:** Discover mixed reality on Meta Quest 3 with First Encounters. You are on a strange new planet and pesky space puffians are about to flood into your room. Catch as many as you can before time runs out \u2013 match colors for a high score!\n\n**My thoughts:** This is the type of game you\u2019ll play for 10-15 minutes and then probably not play again. The proof of concept with mixed reality shown here is quite good, but the gameplay is a bit light. This is the type of game to show off to family and friends to get them excited about what the Quest 3 color passthrough can do. Try it out for sure just to see the potential of mixed reality.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Shores of Loci\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6574680562603944\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1846890\/Shores_of_Loci\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** [**Puzzling Places**](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3931148300302917\/)\u00a0with a light story and far fewer puzzles.\n\n**From the store:** The Shores of Loci is a single-player narrative puzzle game that can only be experienced in VR. With compelling characters, beautiful cinematic scenes, and surreal worlds, the Shores of Loci will transport you to other dimensions to create visions larger than life.\u00a0 In this multidimensional story, Giants and Villagers alike need your help to reclaim their lands and rebuild their cities. Complete your journey creating a universe where puzzled pieces are assembled and transformed.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game kept popping up as a recommendation and I honestly knew nothing about it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Puzzling Places, but you\u2019re creating other worldly cities for aliens to live in. There\u2019s a story there, but it\u2019s superficial at best. If you like Puzzling Places, you may get something out of this, but for me it was over too fast and I\u2019d probably have rather bought a DLC pack in Puzzling Places for more replayability. A neat time, but I believe you can skip this one.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### The Break-In\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6211388292305549\/?utm_source=applabgamelist.com) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1397390\/The_BreakIn\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A wacky break-in simulator\n\n**From the store:** The Break-In is a 4 player online co-op burglary game about sneaking into houses, stores, and casino vaults to steal everything that isn't bolted down. (And maybe some of the things which are bolted down). If you can get it into your van, you can sell it for a profit. And you can use the money you make to purchase new thief equipment, to help you take on riskier heists\n\n**My thoughts:**\u00a0I felt the [Thief Simulator VR: Greenview Street](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3395626290543887\/) vibes immediately from this one, but without the polish. While similar, this game does have it's different game play loop of upgrading your vehicle, tools and multiple locations. There is a fair amount of jank which can lead to a bit of frustration when trying to be silent or sneaky. The main appeal, and what I think is going to make me keep this on my system is the four player co-op. While the jank was still there, spending time in VR with friends always makes things better, and the laughs and stories we had narrowly escaping the cops, or getting away with breaking a window and not getting caught was a blast. Personally, I liked making my own stories - like moving the fridge upside down and wondering what the residents will say when they wake up. For now, I'll say this is a pickup only with friends.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### Just Another Cooking Game\n\n[Quest](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6766207633442740\/) Free\n\n**My quick thoughts:** Another cooking game, but very bare bones.\n\n**From the store:** Just Another Cooking Game is a time management game inspired by several other cooking games such as Overcooked and Cook-Out. JACG is also part of a PhD research project focused on understanding what factors enhance immersion and presence in VR games.\u00a0Play the experience to unlock 12 more levels. Serve all robots as fast as possible to unlock the next level. Cook Under Pressure and see if you can handle the heat!\n\n**My thoughts:** There\u2019s a ton of cooking games out there, almost too many to mention. It\u2019s certainly as advertised, and if you\u2019ve never played the genre before, this is an easy way to get a taste of what they\u2019re like for free. You can\u2019t go wrong with the price, but veterans of the genre won\u2019t find anything new here. This is for newcomers wanting to sample the genre only.\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\n### ","author_fullname":"t2_y7pmh","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Quick reviews of the 22 games I played in September and October","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Journalist)"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/virtualreality","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17wq6jy","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Journalist)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700149985.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.virtualreality","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a link to the article if the text doesn&amp;#39;t appear quite right in Reddit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/reviews-of-the-22-games-i-played-in-september-and-october\/\"&gt;https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/reviews-of-the-22-games-i-played-in-september-and-october\/&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m keeping track of all the VR games I\u2019ve played this year to catalogue them in hopes that they may give fellow VR gamers some fresh games to try out, or reasons to revisit older games that have had updates. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently up to 95 different VR games played this year.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first 22 games I played from January to March can be found are &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/there-are-no-games-to-play-january-march-2023-edition\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 30 games from April to May are &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/quick-thoughts-on-30-different-vr-games\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the 21 from June to August are &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/quick-thoughts-on-21-vr-games\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the games listed below, I can see playing all year long, others are not my cup of tea, but they may interest you enough to try them out.

Our mixed reality game for the Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro brings back the childhood thrill of playing with cars with a twist. Craft your own racing tracks, share them with friends, and compete in high-speed races in a fully immersive environment. This demo version contains a demo track pack containing 20 levels, three cars, and a track editor to challenge your creativity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This is a very generous demo of a Hot Wheels style car racing game that has shades of &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4397519526943470\/\"&gt;Stunt Track Builder VR&lt;\/a&gt;, but with its own unique take on it. While I didn\u2019t find the track building as easy as in Stunt Track Builder VR, it has a campaign with time trials to beat, a variety of vehicles that handle differently, and user created levels that can keep you quite busy for hours. This is a generous free demo and I can\u2019t wait to see how the full version shakes out. Absolutely give it a go if you like Hot Wheels or racing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;I Expect you to Die 3: Cog in the Machine&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4676322075753574\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2296380\/I_Expect_You_To_Die_3_Cog_in_the_Machine\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/strong&gt; A master-class in escape room games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Outwit your most cunning adversary to date in the latest installment of this popular, spy-themed puzzle series. Wield new gadgets, visit action-packed locales, and wear custom disguises as you dive back into the world of espionage in this escape room game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This escape room game is a culmination of ideas, talent and creativity from the first two IEYTD games (three if you count &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4751810638214255\/\"&gt;Home Sweet Home&lt;\/a&gt;) that were all put into this title. The intro alone is worth the price of admission. With a great story, collectibles and reasons to go back to get the best score, or unlock achievements, this puzzle game has legs. This exceptional game continues to deliver smart puzzles and takes the franchise in different directions that I won\u2019t spoil here. Give this one a go if you want to express your inner James Bond.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Poly Ego&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5860797560692158\/?utm_source=www.google.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2463490\/Poly_Ego\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $14.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6667623289970181\/\"&gt;Demo&lt;\/a&gt; Free&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/strong&gt; Budget Portal - in a good way&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; So, you&amp;#39;ve got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism?

Thrust into a reality that teeters between &amp;quot;oh, that&amp;#39;s clever&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;why the hell am I doing this?&amp;quot;, you must navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles, all while a robot named Bluepy keeps you company - and sometimes drives you mad.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; I started off by playing the demo of this clearly Portal inspired game. I\u2019m not going to lie, the movement is not terribly intuitive and frankly tough to get used to. With a bit more polish, it could be a solid Portal-style game. While the game clearly wears its inspiration on its sleeve, it does lack the fine tuning that many games have. That being said, I found myself playing through the entire demo, slowly learning the controls and made my way to the end. I thought \u201cwell, with some more polish, I wonder how a full game might look.\u201d I then noticed they had a full game out. I&amp;#39;m 30 out of 40 levels in and am having quite a good time despite all my concerns. I&amp;#39;ve ran into game breaking bug, and the dev is quick to fix them. There are problems with this game, but the smart puzzles keep pulling me back. If you&amp;#39;re a Portal fan, give the demo a try for sure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Trivia Crack VR&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6709385002410356\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; $9.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/strong&gt; There\u2019s a lot of potential in this trivia game, but give it some time to develop.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; This is a place full of fun and curiosity, where you can share your knowledge with others and prove that you are worthy of becoming the future director of the park. You&amp;#39;ll be able to compete in trivia matches and mini-games with people from all around the world or play on your own and beat your own high scores.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This game feels like it&amp;#39;s in early access, and I\u2019d only recommend playing with friends currently. There is clearly a lot of work left to do in this game as it\u2019s a bare bones 5-player trivia game with wildly inconsistent questions ranging from easy (What is Sponge Bob\u2019s favorite food?) to very specific (What is the smallest island in the Galapagos?). I really think this will be a winner once they flesh out avatars, question difficulty and offer more modes and settings. Let this cook for a couple of months unless you\u2019re dying for some VR trivia. I had a chance to chat with the developers and they really want to make a go of this on the main store, so they are committed to improvements. and it will stay on my Quest as a warmup game with friends.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Call of the Sea VR&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5174697242548672\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/agecheck\/app\/1042490\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $19.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/strong&gt; The captivating story pulls you through this solid puzzle adventure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Call of the Sea VR is an otherworldly tale of mystery and love, set in the 1930s South Pacific. You\u2019ll explore a lush island paradise, solve puzzles and unlock secrets in refreshing new ways with Meta Quest. Go on the hunt for your husband\u2019s missing expedition as Norah Everhart, fully voice-acted by Cissy Jones (Firewatch, The Walking Dead: Season 1), and take in the beautiful sights of a cryptic land, uncovering occult mysteries and venturing through forgotten ruins.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This puzzle adventure game kept me intrigued and scratching my head a few times. Not terribly difficult, and not technically impressive, I did find the story very unique and the environments varied. I didn\u2019t run into any glitches - a key in puzzle games, but I did find the hint system to be a bit too generous at times. If you haven\u2019t had your fill of puzzle games, I\u2019d suggest this one for the story and quality voice acting. At roughly 5-7 hours of gameplay, it\u2019s one you can sink your teeth into.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTD: Find the Difference&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6055957821167625\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; Free&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/strong&gt; A bit too clunky despite a lot of content.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Welcome to an enchanting world where your keen observation skills and VR technology intertwine to create a captivating gaming experience. Prepare yourself for an exciting journey through 18 distinct room types, ranging from a delightful bakery to a thrilling arcade and a warm living room. Your mission in this immersive VR game is to detect the differences between two versions of each room, using your visual acuity, memory, and problem-solving abilities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This game was $15 and then it went free. While you could do worse on the app store, I just didn\u2019t find the experience polished enough to keep playing. There are a lot of levels here to keep you busy finding the difference between environments, and with different difficulty levels if this one speaks to you, you\u2019ll get some good game time out of it. For me though, it just didn\u2019t click and I\u2019d only recommend it for those fans of the genre.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Mini Golf Aeons&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/en-gb\/experiences\/4881013271998328\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; Free w\/full game IAP \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2335950\/Mini_Golf_Aeons__Full_Game\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $11.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; The third best mini golf game I\u2019ve played on Quest&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Get ready for the ultimate VR mini golf adventure with Mini Golf Aeons! Explore four distinct and exciting worlds, including a desert landscape, an ocean view, a prehistoric jungle, and a frozen Antarctic wonderland. Each world features beautifully designed and challenging courses that are based on real-life greens, ensuring a truly immersive and authentic experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; I\u2019ve played a bunch of mini golf games on the Quest, and this is the third best I\u2019ve played. It will soon be the second when Golf+ removes their mini golf game. While this isn\u2019t going to replace Walkabout Mini Golf, it\u2019s doing it&amp;#39;s own thing and going for a more realistic environment than WMG. A bit clunky and slow (you have to wait a few seconds to putt until you hear a bell), I didn\u2019t get into a good flow after the first course (9 holes). The putting did feel pretty solid though. It was quite close to feeling like real life - with a few tweaks still needed in my opinion. The demo didn\u2019t compel me to buy the full game, but I\u2019d certainly keep an eye out because it really is close to being very a very solid game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Yupitergrad 2: The Lost Station&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4446075785447064\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969000\/Yupitergrad_2_The_Lost_Station\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; A Metroidvania style game that loses steam halfway in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Epic action-adventure is back. Yupitergrad 2 raises the stakes. Check out the refined movement and combat system, evade obstacles, and see what surprises the new space journey will bring. Taste new challenges, use new items &amp;amp; discover the secret of the abandoned base. It&amp;#39;s a mix of arcade, parkour, and puzzles, Metroidvania style. It&amp;#39;s an experience that has never been deeply explored in VR before.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; I was really excited to play this sequel. I quite enjoyed the first game. The swinging gameplay and physics were spot on, and more of the same sounded good - with the added benefit of a Metroidvania style game. While the core gameplay was still solid, much to my disappointment, the upgrades and game itself quickly lost my interest. Halfway through, the constant back and forth of exacting platforming grew to be quite the chore. With most Metroidvania games, you open up a new secret path to avoid a lot of backtracking, but that is not the case with this game, you&amp;#39;re stuck taking the long road back again, and again. While I did finish it, and the story was fun, the game didn\u2019t have the same pizazz as the first. Honestly, I\u2019d skip this one, and if you haven\u2019t played either, absolutely go with the first as it has a lot more content to keep you busy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;EarthQuest&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6320120764784270\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; $4.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; An app that tries hard to be &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/348250\/Google_Earth_VR\/\"&gt;Google Earth&lt;\/a&gt; on Quest&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Street View Integration: I&amp;#39;m thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level. Single Player Mode: I&amp;#39;ve implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience. It&amp;#39;s optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; Considering the limitations of the Quest and all the data that Google Earth is calling for, this is an impressive app. It\u2019s certainly not as good as Google Earth on Steam proper, but if you don\u2019t have access to that, this is the second best option. While a bit clunky to navigate, slow to load at times, and not as graphically impressive, EarthQuest is something fun to experiment and play with. If this is something that interests you even mildly, you could do worse for $4.99. Give it a try, but know that there are some real limitations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;October&lt;\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Eye of the Temple&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/5361030930653377\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/589940\/Eye_of_the_Temple\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $19.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; An interesting example of a room-scale game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand. This game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; I wanted to give this room-scale game the best chance for success. I went into my garage and had a nice wide open area to experience traversing the game world. From the image and description, I thought &amp;quot;who doesn\u2019t want to pretend to be Indiana Jones collecting treasure and whipping enemies?&amp;quot; Well, it wasn\u2019t like that at all. While the room-scale movement was very functional, the game play of collecting gems and struggling to get my whip working correctly was just not that engaging. I put in a decent amount of time with this, but going back and forth to figure out a puzzle and having to wait for the environment to give you the opportunity to move on, via moving blocks was time consuming and quickly lost my interest. If you have the room space and the idea of room scale gaming sounds interesting, it may be your cup of tea, but honestly, I would recommend you try out the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3762343440541585\/\"&gt;Tea for God&lt;\/a&gt; demo on Quest for a bit more action, or &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3381040775329400\/\"&gt;traVRsal&lt;\/a&gt; for some real walking around at your own pace.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Killer Frequency&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/4629225960449550\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1903620\/Killer_Frequency\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; A creepy fun time where you can live out your radio dj dreams.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; The year is 1987, and as the clock strikes midnight in small-town Gallows Creek, USA, former big city radio DJ Forrest Nash is live on air in what will turn out to be the graveyard shift of a lifetime. In this horror comedy, you must solve puzzles to save callers from being hunted down by a mysterious killer. Where every call is life and death, can you save the inhabitants of Gallows Creek?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This is a really unique game that I quite enjoyed most of the way through. Paced appropriately, you\u2019ll work your way through saving citizens from a killer that\u2019s loose on the streets via phone calls. While you don\u2019t have a lot of freedom in the game, the game has a story to tell and guides you deftly through multiple puzzles that are different and interesting. I had a good time messing around with the dj equipment and exploring the radio station as it opened up as the game progressed. The game was certainly creepy and tense at times, but not overtly horror filled. I did lose some steam at the end, but saw it through. You can replay the game to try and save (or kill) more citizens, but a lack of fast forward\/skipping scenes put me off from that.\u00a0 Also, since it was so tightly scripted, I wished that there would have been some interactions with callers or my co-host when I pressed sound board buttons, or played music. Overall, a unique game that is absolutely worth a look if the trailer interests you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Dungeons of Eternity&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6341779295861881\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; $29.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; One of the best games on the Quest, especially if you have a friend or two.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; When a cataclysmic cosmic event threatens your homeworld, the only hope for survival lies within the endless labyrinth of dungeons on the forsaken planet known as Eternity. Hack-n-slash takes on a new meaning in VR: swing swords, throw axes, use bows, wield magic staffs, and more to make it out alive. With the power of VR, you will be immersed in a fantasy adventure like no other.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This co-op dungeon crawler has a gameplay loop that is supremely satisfying. With randomly generated rooms that change a few times every hour, you and your buddies will have a new adventure to play each time. The amount of loot, cosmetics and camaraderie that you get from each run gives you a sense of satisfaction that I rarely see from games on Quest. This is the type of game where you finish a run and just want to play one more time. With minimal bugs, a thriving Discord community and new items being added often, now is the time to jump into this one. Solo is good, but co-op is really where the fun is at - talking about what path to take, reviving your fallen warriors and sharing the joy of new loot is incredible. Seldom have I seen a game this polished at launch, and it&amp;#39;s only gotten better. Pick this one up for sure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Time Stall&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/2055554051161375\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; A fun puzzle game with a frozen-in-time twist that has playful characters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Welcome aboard the Fantastic Leap, Earth&amp;#39;s only crowdfunded, luxury escape craft! As the only human serving alongside a robotic crew, your job is to keep the ship safe using TIME STALL, the ship&amp;#39;s time-bending safety protocol. When disaster strikes, Time Stall temporarily freezes time aboard the ship, allowing you to manipulate objects, divert projectiles and combine various objects\u2026whatever it takes to save the ship and her Captain from destruction!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This was a unique puzzle game with the catch being that time slowed for the objects around you giving you a limited amount of time to to solve the problem by manipulating items around the environment. Each puzzle was unique and interesting, but the extra hidden objectives for each level weren\u2019t enough to keep me around replaying it after I finished. A shorter game for sure, but the unique premise is enough for me to recommend it. The fun and quirky characters and playful interactions you can have were well thought out. Just don\u2019t go in expecting a multiple hour adventure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;First Encounters&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6236169136472090\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; Free&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; A neat free adventure to try out mixed reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Discover mixed reality on Meta Quest 3 with First Encounters. You are on a strange new planet and pesky space puffians are about to flood into your room. Catch as many as you can before time runs out \u2013 match colors for a high score!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This is the type of game you\u2019ll play for 10-15 minutes and then probably not play again. The proof of concept with mixed reality shown here is quite good, but the gameplay is a bit light. This is the type of game to show off to family and friends to get them excited about what the Quest 3 color passthrough can do. Try it out for sure just to see the potential of mixed reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Shores of Loci&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6574680562603944\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1846890\/Shores_of_Loci\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3931148300302917\/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puzzling Places&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;\u00a0with a light story and far fewer puzzles.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; The Shores of Loci is a single-player narrative puzzle game that can only be experienced in VR. With compelling characters, beautiful cinematic scenes, and surreal worlds, the Shores of Loci will transport you to other dimensions to create visions larger than life.\u00a0 In this multidimensional story, Giants and Villagers alike need your help to reclaim their lands and rebuild their cities. Complete your journey creating a universe where puzzled pieces are assembled and transformed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; This game kept popping up as a recommendation and I honestly knew nothing about it. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Puzzling Places, but you\u2019re creating other worldly cities for aliens to live in. There\u2019s a story there, but it\u2019s superficial at best. If you like Puzzling Places, you may get something out of this, but for me it was over too fast and I\u2019d probably have rather bought a DLC pack in Puzzling Places for more replayability. A neat time, but I believe you can skip this one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Break-In&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6211388292305549\/?utm_source=applabgamelist.com\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1397390\/The_BreakIn\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; A wacky break-in simulator&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; The Break-In is a 4 player online co-op burglary game about sneaking into houses, stores, and casino vaults to steal everything that isn&amp;#39;t bolted down. (And maybe some of the things which are bolted down). If you can get it into your van, you can sell it for a profit. And you can use the money you make to purchase new thief equipment, to help you take on riskier heists&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt;\u00a0I felt the &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/3395626290543887\/\"&gt;Thief Simulator VR: Greenview Street&lt;\/a&gt; vibes immediately from this one, but without the polish. While similar, this game does have it&amp;#39;s different game play loop of upgrading your vehicle, tools and multiple locations. There is a fair amount of jank which can lead to a bit of frustration when trying to be silent or sneaky. The main appeal, and what I think is going to make me keep this on my system is the four player co-op. While the jank was still there, spending time in VR with friends always makes things better, and the laughs and stories we had narrowly escaping the cops, or getting away with breaking a window and not getting caught was a blast. Personally, I liked making my own stories - like moving the fridge upside down and wondering what the residents will say when they wake up. For now, I&amp;#39;ll say this is a pickup only with friends.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\ud83d\udcf7&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Just Another Cooking Game&lt;\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/6766207633442740\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; Free&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; Another cooking game, but very bare bones.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\/strong&gt; Just Another Cooking Game is a time management game inspired by several other cooking games such as Overcooked and Cook-Out. JACG is also part of a PhD research project focused on understanding what factors enhance immersion and presence in VR games.\u00a0Play the experience to unlock 12 more levels. Serve all robots as fast as possible to unlock the next level. Cook Under Pressure and see if you can handle the heat!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/strong&gt; There\u2019s a ton of cooking games out there, almost too many to mention. It\u2019s certainly as advertised, and if you\u2019ve never played the genre before, this is an easy way to get a taste of what they\u2019re like for free. You can\u2019t go wrong with the price, but veterans of the genre won\u2019t find anything new here.

I started this thread and didn\u2019t get much feedback on it. [Previous Thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17qidny\/i_think_my_q3_controller_haptics_suddenly_became\/?share_id=iV7KnJks5deLcbpWyGYf3)\n\nAnd then I searched, and searched, and searched, and nobody was talking about it, so I started thinking it was just me, or my controllers suddenly developed an issue. A guy I work with also has a Q3 and we brought both of ours to work to test side by side, it was immediately apparent his felt better, like mine did before. We then synced my controllers to his headset, and they felt fine again. Then we went back to mine, it was bad. We did this back and forth a few times to make sure we weren\u2019t crazy, but it was an obvious difference. We also noticed his controllers were on a different firmware, 1.5.8, while mine were 1.9.2. He hadn\u2019t used his Quest in a couple days, but in the middle of doing all of this his updated to 1.9.2 and still felt fine.\n\nI started thinking maybe I had an issue with the headset itself. I had also loaded my Quest with a lot of side loaded content using Rookie and SideQuest, something he hasn\u2019t done, and I thought maybe there was something conflicting with my haptics. I tested multiple batteries and went over every setting in the menu with a fine tooth comb, nothing was working. I should also mention I didn\u2019t notice any haptic issues within games, it was only when browsing the Quest menu. After work my coworker texted me and said his felt bad now too. I thought maybe he was just being paranoid, but he kept saying he could tell they were different now and felt the same as mine had.\n\nI still had a feeling this could have been some type of stealth firmware update, something they added in later to a previous update, and the only thing left for me to do was factory reset my Q3. After doing that, I immediately noticed it felt good again during the setup process. Once I got back into the menus, it felt great, like it had felt before. I restarted my Quest and unchecked the prompt for automatic updates, and when it came back on, it felt horrible again. I factory reset my Q3 two more times and tried to figure out a why to prevent it from updating, but any restart forced an update, even though my firmware versions weren\u2019t changing on either the headset or the controllers, I would come back and the controllers would feel weak again. Also, some of the menus changed, like the controller menu and the Horizon Feed, which was more evidence that a stealth patch was happening.\n\nAfter struggling with this for a few days I\u2019m relieved to know what actually happened, but I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t discussing it. They feel BAD now. When they\u2019re set to high vibration in the settings, they now feel like what the lowest setting used to feel like.

I started this thread and didn\u2019t get much feedback on it. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17qidny\/i_think_my_q3_controller_haptics_suddenly_became\/?share_id=iV7KnJks5deLcbpWyGYf3\"&gt;Previous Thread&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I searched, and searched, and searched, and nobody was talking about it, so I started thinking it was just me, or my controllers suddenly developed an issue. A guy I work with also has a Q3 and we brought both of ours to work to test side by side, it was immediately apparent his felt better, like mine did before. We then synced my controllers to his headset, and they felt fine again. Then we went back to mine, it was bad. We did this back and forth a few times to make sure we weren\u2019t crazy, but it was an obvious difference. We also noticed his controllers were on a different firmware, 1.5.8, while mine were 1.9.2. He hadn\u2019t used his Quest in a couple days, but in the middle of doing all of this his updated to 1.9.2 and still felt fine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started thinking maybe I had an issue with the headset itself. I had also loaded my Quest with a lot of side loaded content using Rookie and SideQuest, something he hasn\u2019t done, and I thought maybe there was something conflicting with my haptics. I tested multiple batteries and went over every setting in the menu with a fine tooth comb, nothing was working. I should also mention I didn\u2019t notice any haptic issues within games, it was only when browsing the Quest menu. After work my coworker texted me and said his felt bad now too. I thought maybe he was just being paranoid, but he kept saying he could tell they were different now and felt the same as mine had.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still had a feeling this could have been some type of stealth firmware update, something they added in later to a previous update, and the only thing left for me to do was factory reset my Q3. After doing that, I immediately noticed it felt good again during the setup process. Once I got back into the menus, it felt great, like it had felt before. I restarted my Quest and unchecked the prompt for automatic updates, and when it came back on, it felt horrible again. I factory reset my Q3 two more times and tried to figure out a why to prevent it from updating, but any restart forced an update, even though my firmware versions weren\u2019t changing on either the headset or the controllers, I would come back and the controllers would feel weak again. Also, some of the menus changed, like the controller menu and the Horizon Feed, which was more evidence that a stealth patch was happening.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After struggling with this for a few days I\u2019m relieved to know what actually happened, but I\u2019m surprised more people aren\u2019t discussing it. They feel BAD now. When they\u2019re set to high vibration in the settings, they now feel like what the lowest setting used to feel like.

In my own case, I am a 30-year entertainment and heavy industry animator and designer. I am very much used to working with a keyboard and mouse as my input tools, with most of my current work focused on 3D modeling these days. I want nothing more than to be able to jump into VR and build models as fast and accurately as I can in pancake mode but the VR tools just feel so counter-intuitive to how I want to work. Here's how I see it -- a mouse is really good at moving from a specific point to a specific point and staying there. The path the mouse takes from one point to another does not really matter much to the outcome of the desired function, but relies on the accuracy of going from point to point, with plenty of time to rest between mouse moves if necessary. VR motion controllers are the exact opposite -- the function is much more dependent on the path the controllers takes through space, but the ability to stop and rest at a specific location is near impossible, bar some sort of snapping. I have tried every single VR 3D app out there, from SculptVR to Kodon to Substance 3D Modeler to Gravity Sketch to Tilt Brush and all of its descendants. Any of them that focus on real modeling still use tools that were developed for a mouse and keyboard. The only one of them that embraces the flow of the motion as part of the input is Tilt Brush, as it was the one most designed to be a VR app at its core, and not standard pancake apps ported into VR.

In my own case, I am a 30-year entertainment and heavy industry animator and designer. I am very much used to working with a keyboard and mouse as my input tools, with most of my current work focused on 3D modeling these days. I want nothing more than to be able to jump into VR and build models as fast and accurately as I can in pancake mode but the VR tools just feel so counter-intuitive to how I want to work. Here&amp;#39;s how I see it -- a mouse is really good at moving from a specific point to a specific point and staying there. The path the mouse takes from one point to another does not really matter much to the outcome of the desired function, but relies on the accuracy of going from point to point, with plenty of time to rest between mouse moves if necessary. VR motion controllers are the exact opposite -- the function is much more dependent on the path the controllers takes through space, but the ability to stop and rest at a specific location is near impossible, bar some sort of snapping. I have tried every single VR 3D app out there, from SculptVR to Kodon to Substance 3D Modeler to Gravity Sketch to Tilt Brush and all of its descendants. Any of them that focus on real modeling still use tools that were developed for a mouse and keyboard. The only one of them that embraces the flow of the motion as part of the input is Tilt Brush, as it was the one most designed to be a VR app at its core, and not standard pancake apps ported into VR.

Marescaux said the technology is benchmarked at 10^10 endurance which would provide that level of performance.

He had this zombie\/horror game that we were all playing and it was super fun and scary, in fact it made me want to get a VR kit just to play that game. Well, I couldn't really afford it as I didn't have a PC either. Anyway, fast forward to now when I can afford a VR Kit and want to get one, but I am having trouble finding the game we played years ago.\n\nI no longer talk to that friend, we have gone our separate ways and I try to ask my other friends and they remember playing the game, they just don't know what the name is. I tried to type what I remember about it into Google and I can not find anything that sounds remotely like it nor can I find gameplay of any game that has the stage that I and my friends remember playing.\n\nSo anyway, this is what I remember about the game. You start off in your character's apartment, the TV gives exposition about some sort of attack that loops as you explore the apartment. In the apartment you find a flashlight, batteries, water bottle, snacks, and clothes to make into bandages. At some point your character triggers the start of the game which is there is a bunch of accidents and screaming in the distance and then there's a city-wide blackout. You leave your apartment and outside there's blood and debris all over the hallway. You come to a dead cop character whose dead body is holding a gun. You loot the gun and ammo from the cop's body and you make your way through the dark hallways of the apartment complex. You're on a higher floor and you have to work your way to the ground floor, but once you get to the stairs you encounter the first zombie, then you have to work your way through all the zombies in the apartment building until you find your way out, but it's like suspenseful zombies, like at first you feel like, \"This isn't too bad, I can handle this\" and then all of a sudden you're knee deep in zombie guts wondering why they all look like Steven Tyler.\n\nAnyway, I can not remember the name of the game, it isn't Arizona Sunshine, the art style is VERY different.

He had this zombie\/horror game that we were all playing and it was super fun and scary, in fact it made me want to get a VR kit just to play that game. Well, I couldn&amp;#39;t really afford it as I didn&amp;#39;t have a PC either. Anyway, fast forward to now when I can afford a VR Kit and want to get one, but I am having trouble finding the game we played years ago.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I no longer talk to that friend, we have gone our separate ways and I try to ask my other friends and they remember playing the game, they just don&amp;#39;t know what the name is. I tried to type what I remember about it into Google and I can not find anything that sounds remotely like it nor can I find gameplay of any game that has the stage that I and my friends remember playing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyway, this is what I remember about the game. You start off in your character&amp;#39;s apartment, the TV gives exposition about some sort of attack that loops as you explore the apartment. In the apartment you find a flashlight, batteries, water bottle, snacks, and clothes to make into bandages. At some point your character triggers the start of the game which is there is a bunch of accidents and screaming in the distance and then there&amp;#39;s a city-wide blackout. You leave your apartment and outside there&amp;#39;s blood and debris all over the hallway. You come to a dead cop character whose dead body is holding a gun. You loot the gun and ammo from the cop&amp;#39;s body and you make your way through the dark hallways of the apartment complex. You&amp;#39;re on a higher floor and you have to work your way to the ground floor, but once you get to the stairs you encounter the first zombie, then you have to work your way through all the zombies in the apartment building until you find your way out, but it&amp;#39;s like suspenseful zombies, like at first you feel like, &amp;quot;This isn&amp;#39;t too bad, I can handle this&amp;quot; and then all of a sudden you&amp;#39;re knee deep in zombie guts wondering why they all look like Steven Tyler.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I can not remember the name of the game, it isn&amp;#39;t Arizona Sunshine, the art style is VERY different. You could tell the game I&amp;#39;m describing had more &amp;quot;realistic&amp;quot; look to it. So yeah, those are my questions, if anyone could help me out with either one that would be great.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"4a23b1e6-a0c8-11e9-8400-0ef1a9161d84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qp9o","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"1790758","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"WalkingLootChest","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/1790758\/are_there_any_extraction_shooters_like_eft_in_vr\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/1790758\/are_there_any_extraction_shooters_like_eft_in_vr\/","subreddit_subscribers":797651,"created_utc":1697440542.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"virtualreality","selftext":"I love the new Quest 3.

It&amp;#39;s pretty simple as that, although you have good tracking if you lay on the floor, if you want to be in a bed or on anything squishy the estimation does not yet account for this and as such laying down means everything goes out of whack.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a lot more information I can post about this device but a tl;dr is this:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is not perfect, however it is by far the best non laser tracking option we have on the market and if you don&amp;#39;t want to wait over a year and a bit for slime trackers, i&amp;#39;d reccomend giving this a go.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any other questions I will be more than happy to answer&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"35ed7f94-9fc5-11e9-9903-0e29179645cc","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qp9o","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"174uxnd","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"AdditionEvery1563","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/174uxnd\/haritora_x_wireless_advice_before_you_buy\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/174uxnd\/haritora_x_wireless_advice_before_you_buy\/","subreddit_subscribers":790763,"created_utc":1696968915.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"virtualreality","selftext":"My daughter has autism and loves the aesthetic of rain storms and different types of weather is there any game where she can just sit in a rain storm and look around with no gameplay just a game focused on stuff like that?

Here are my thoughts on why you as the consumer should not buy the Quest 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Mixed reality is a main focus for the Quest 3 but the passthrough quality isn't very good. I'm surprised by how the press has been downplaying the poor quality. Yes the quality is better than the Quest Pro with less distortion and less grain but it still feels like you're seeing the world in 720p and it DOES NOT FEEL GOOD AT ALL. I have doubts that people will find the MR acceptable. Passthrough may be important in the future but this version of it isn't it and you shouldn't buy the Quest 3 just for MR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Developers are being burned by Meta and so content will again be sparse for this generation of hardware. There won't be any significant games that'll be coming out that will be exclusive to the Quest 3. $499 is a lot to ask just for a slightly better visual experience for only a small portion of games you've already played. Remember: devs need to update their games so they fully utilise the new hardware.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. Poor hardware pricing. $499 is a lot of money especially for the base model 128GB. Meta is testing the waters by seeing how consumers react to the increased price. Don't fall for it. If you do we're going to end up with more expensive headsets here on out. There's a reason why there's a big jump in pricing from 128GB to 512GB. A Quest Lite will be released to fill that middle price point. It's a clever strategy. Those who are already into VR will pay more for the Quest 3 and after this group has made their purchases, Meta will release the Quest Lite at a fairer price point for those who didn't buy in at $499 \/ $650.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. The next hardware generation (Quest 4) will be much much better. The economy would have recovered by then and there wouldn't be as much financial pressure on Meta to overcharge. There will be more games and non-games available since the Apple Vision Pro would have released and attracted new types of developers and light a fire underneath Meta. Mixed reality will be at a quality that's more acceptable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo skip this generation of hardware. The Quest 2 does everything you use VR for already.

Unless if your just sitting down and next to the pc. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"4a23b1e6-a0c8-11e9-8400-0ef1a9161d84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qp9o","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"16xo049","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"MiraiYuno","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/16xo049\/best_audio_solution_for_pcvr\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/16xo049\/best_audio_solution_for_pcvr\/","subreddit_subscribers":781436,"created_utc":1696223900.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"virtualreality","selftext":"I've never seen this advice passed around so I thought I'd share.
