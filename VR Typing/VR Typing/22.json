There's really no point to this post other than expressing my enjoyment of these titles.    \n\n[Tower Tag](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/deeplink\/?action=view&amp;path=app\/3812563858803226&amp;ref=oculus_desktop)    \nThis one on AppLab suffers from low player count.  But it is one of the most enjoyable mutliplayer team and\/or 1v1 games with 3 modes of play (Deathmatch, Elimination and Goaltower which is like capture the flag).  I really hope this game succeeds in the long run because it really is the best team experience I've had in VR.  If you download and like this game, DM me and I'll add you to a group chat we have to help organize matches.  Or, my favorite is 1v1 Elimination.      \n\n[Ultimechs](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/deeplink\/?action=view&amp;path=app\/5118731164870081&amp;ref=oculus_desktop)    \nThis is more popular and has a consitant player base.  Same developers as Blaston which I also like a lot but is not in this top 3 list for me.  Ultimechs is a fast paced ball\/goal game using robots, teleportation movement and a unique ball handling mechanism that makes the game super fun and competitive.  Lots to learn with this one.    \n\n[Divine Duel](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/deeplink\/?action=view&amp;path=app\/6010612775656934&amp;ref=oculus_desktop).   \nDivine Duel was recently released on AppLab and is a 1v1 dueling game sort of like Blaston.  There are weapons that spawn at different durations and each has their own stats like speed, damage and spawn time.  Super fun.  I think it's a bit more complex with a clearer path to progress compared to Blaston which is why I've spent more time playing it over the last few weeks.    \n\nI guess I just wanted to share what I've been enjoying on my Quest 2 since I bought it almost a year ago.

I just don't want to talk to anyone or be forced to squad up\n\nI used to play PUBG all the time, and one of the things I liked about it was that I could play alone but against other players. This was a great way to first learn the game and get comfortable with it, but even after I started playing squads I still enjoyed playing solo occasionally because it was such a different experience. My favorite game in vr right now is Into the Radius. I love the gun mechanics, the atmosphere, and the laid back style with brief moments of intense action. It will never have any kind of multiplayer or 1v1 though\n\nI can only play on the Quest 2 so no PCVR for me","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":78328,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Battle Royale style games with option to play solo?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/11v565a\/battle_royale_style_games_with_option_to_play_solo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"lkmboogie","author_created_utc":1473528843,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_11bcgh","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1678590501,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.OculusQuest2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"11p3kil","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#ffaf32","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a64e8336-f943-11ea-a7ba-0e9162da605f","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_11p3kil","no_follow":true,"num_comments":7,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/11p3kil\/do_i_have_enough_to_be_able_to_use_the_quest_2_on\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1681011951,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hope someone can clear things up for me.\n\nSome of the stuff matches the requirements that are stated on the website, but others don't.

ya'll. I wanted to make a quick post so that this is searchable for other people having this issue, as I am sure this is likely to be common for people like me who are returning to VR for the first time after a long hiatus and the solution that worked for me was not listed anywhere I looked online.\n\nI haven't played on my Oculus Quest 2 (now called \"Meta Quest 2\") for about 1-2 years. I got the itch to play a bit of VR recently and charged up my headset.\n\n**My situation and what DIDN'T WORK:**\n\nAfter about an hour of charging, I tried turning it on. I got some beeps and boops letting me know it was turning on and the oculus logo on my screen. Sometimes I would get three dots in the center to signify it was loading. But then it would go \"black\" (LED backlight was definitely still on, but nothing was on screen). Sometimes when restarting the headset, the controllers would vibrate, but nothing would be on-screen (no controller stuff). Pressing and holding the volume +\/- buttons would cause the volume on-screen display to appear normally and I could adjust the volume. Nothing else was working.\n\nI googled the issue and saw a bunch of scary stuff about the \"Black Screen of Death\" and prepared myself for a few hours of reading and tinkering instead of playing games. If you're reading this, this is probably where you are at right now. Hopefully I can help speed this process up for you. Haha.\n\nI opened the oculus app on my cellphone. My headset was detected and could connect, but I couldn't do anything useful (like remote restart, factory reset, or software update). I thought maybe the Oculus desktop app could give me better options. I installed the app ([https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/download\\_app\/?id=1582076955407037](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/download_app\/?id=1582076955407037)) on my desktop, and then connected my headset via USB. Again, the headset was detected in the app, but no useful options at my disposal - I could only check the device version info.\n\nI found this video showing how to manually update the firmware ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VIZGoDyv7c8&amp;t=1s](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VIZGoDyv7c8&amp;t=1s)) and downloaded the .zip of the update firmware and the suggested tool (I couldn't find an official repository download link for the firmware anywhere and I was kind of desperate, haha). After trying out the .BAT file, I noticed that my headset was not being detected by it. I'd run it, and then press a key to continue, but no headset was listed - so I'd just close the command prompt window.\n\nAt this point in my testing, I had this headset plugged in charging for like 2 hours at least, and had rebooted it several times. A lot of people were saying the most common reason for the black screen was that the headset was not charged, so I was convinced that was not the issue for me and it was something else. I was concerned that I might have fried the headset because I wasn't using a stock charger. I was using a macbook pro charger because it's high amp and charges things really quick.\n\n**WHAT ACTUALLY WORKED (HOW I FIXED IT)**\n\nI'm going to be honest, this is not going to be something I am confident you can replicate. But I wanted to document what I did in hopes of helping other people out. I found this article ([https:\/\/vrheaven.io\/oculus-black-screen-of-death\/](https:\/\/vrheaven.io\/oculus-black-screen-of-death\/)) and was interested in \"Step 7\" which involved doing a factory reset of the headset. Oddly though, in the guide it says to hold the power button and the volume button**s**. That's button with a plural -s. I was confused because I was sure it was a volume **rocker** that didn't allow you to press both buttons at the same time. I tried it and it was definitely a rocker, but I tried what they said anyways by holding all 3 buttons (though what ended up happening is that I kind of briefly hit the + button, then held the power button while also holding the - button). The headset did some flashes and then rebooted, but instead of getting the menu they have on that article that lets you select the factory reset option, I got a picture of a \"dead\" android robot with the words \"NO COMMAND\" on the bottom (Looks like this: [https:\/\/images.ultfone.com\/topics\/android\/android-no-command.jpg](https:\/\/images.ultfone.com\/topics\/android\/android-no-command.jpg)). No button presses did anything.\n\nAt this point, I was almost certain I just bricked my headset. But this is where things got weirder, and then somehow better.\n\nI turned my headset off by holding the power button until it went black. Then turned it back on. This time when it booted up, I got a flash of a menu on screen saying something like \"allow device access?\". But then it went black again. This was not happening before. But I couldn't remember if I tried rebooting the headset with it connected to my computer. My headset happened to still be plugged in from my testing with the oculus desktop app. I thought that maybe if I could hit that \"yes\" button it might fix why that manual firmware updater wasn't recognizing my device. So I turned my headset off by holding the power button. That when I got a VERY BRIEF flash on the screen showing my controllers before it started the shutdown animation. So I was like, well maybe it will just start working now?.... I turned the headset back on and saw that \"allow device access menu\" again (I can't remember, but it might have gone black again and then I rebooted one more time) but then that screen disappeared and instead the guardian boundary config tool appeared and passthrough mode was now working (I could see through the headset).\n\nI configured the boundaries and then the normal quest 2 menu stuff started working. I reconnected the headset to my wifi (my password was changed since I last used it). But the store pages and content was not loading. I got some weird menu flashes and then it said I had to sign in to facebook. I tried signing in but it said I couldn't do that without updating. I went to the settings and then started downloading the update. After that was done, I selected \"restart and apply\".\n\nThe update applied very quickly (like 2-3 mins). Then the headset rebooted and the oculus loading logo was replaced with a Meta logo. It finished loading and I was back in the main menu thing where I could open apps and stuff.\n\nAt this point though, I noticed something concerning. The headset was \"flickering\". The screen kept going black every 5-10 seconds and then would work normally. I went into the settings and checked for updates again. Sure enough, there were more to download. I charged the headset back up to 50% again and downloaded the next set of updates, then restarted and applied them.\n\nEven after a reboot, the apps were not working. Store, people, installed apps, etc.. Nothing would load. Sometimes the store page would stop loading and would display some error code that began with \"HFCXXXXXXX\" or something like that. I tried rebooting again and found that the menu button was having me open [www.meta.com\/device](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/device) on my desktop computer and then type the code from my headset there.\n\nAfter I typed that code in, my headset started working normally. It went into a tutorial mode that I closed. I went to my app menu and the apps were then loading normally. I started updating virtual desktop so I can play my PC-VR games.\n\nI hope this helps someone fix their OCULUS Quest 2, good luck! The rest of this is just going to be me upset with Facebook. So feel free to skip that bit.\n\n**\\^\\^ SCROLL BACK UP FOR HOW TO FIX \\^\\^**\n\n**IT'S JUST ME BEING MAD AT FACEBOOK FROM HERE DOWN**\n\n**Fuck you Facebook.** No seriously. **Fuck you.** My headset worked perfectly before I stopped playing and I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the reason it stopped working and I had to spend 3-4 hours of my life troubleshooting a perfectly fine headset was because of some software fuckery you conjured up to collect more data about all of us. This is fucking ridiculous. **I will ABSOLUTELY NOT being purchasing another VR headset associated with Facebook, Meta, or any of your partners in the future.

I use a BT home hub 5 that I got from a friend, who had it lying around in his house for a couple years.\n\nSo, connect the router to your PC, by ethernet, in port 1 (i don't know if which port you use is that important but this is how i did it) \n\nOn your pc, type [192.168.0.1](https:\/\/192.168.0.1) into your address bar on a browser (yes, i know you don't have internet, this takes you to your router settings page, which is basically a web page hosted on your router that doesn't need a connection to the rest of the internet).\n\nThere will be a login screen, look at the bottom of your router for the admin password ( this is not the network password, the ADMIN password.) enter that, then you will see a menu.\n\nIn the settings, turn off the 2.4ghz mode, and make sure that the 5ghz mode is on the maximum speed. Rename the network if you want, you aren't gonna want to connect anything but your VR headset and PC to it. then, disable DCHP and change the IP of the router. This allows it to be used as a \"repeater\".\n\nNow, save these settings and plug the extender into port 2 of the router, also with ethernet. Wait a couple minutes at most, then you should see that your PC is able to connect to the internet. Connect your Quest 2 to the vr router (I named mine \"\\*name\\*s VR network, for clarity) then, connect with airlink as normal. here's a diagram to explain what's happening, and why its better than just connecting to the extender.\n\n[roughly what's happening](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s1km611podca1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ac32abab3b4040841a30086f6bc4fc827ca3615b)\n\nSo, the reason this is faster is because the \"vr\" router only has to deal with whatever traffic your PC is asking for, rather than whatever other devices are on the network. also, the full-size router is just faster. there may be a very slight latency increase (under 1 or 2 milliseconds, not noticeable) for online games (NOT your Quest -&gt; PC latency, your game -&gt; server latency, known as \"ping\") the reason this works is because a router is basically a tiny computer, and it has to process all the traffic going through it. minimise traffic, maximise performance. good luck, and enjoy!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":77066,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/ZlKBjfiUVS3yOwoGGtl78UWjo5_NhWdTxw_s2ptzEqs.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"For those who do not have their PC in the same room as a router, here's how you can get a good airlink connection.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.69,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/10dau4o\/for_those_who_do_not_have_their_pc_in_the_same\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"introvertedgoof","author_created_utc":1575497613,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_55o5xa96","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1673531766,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.OculusQuest2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10a08c6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#ffaf32","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a64e8336-f943-11ea-a7ba-0e9162da605f","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10a08c6","no_follow":false,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/10a08c6\/steering_wheel\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676241402,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Not sure if anyone asked, but does the Meta Quest 2 have any type of Bluetooth steering wheel support?

I have a few games but 95% of the time I just play Beat Saber. I will get about 1 or 2 weeks into some Beat Sabing before BAM another controller breaks. \n\nI have never dropped them, smashed them into a wall, banged them together, thrown them, sat on them, ran them over with a car, NOTHING. I have tireless looked into broken controllers and it's always like \"help I threw my controller through a brick wall and now it broke\", but I swear I never treat them bad. Regardless though, I will consistently see them break after a 1 or 2 week period, guaranteed. One of them did last a month but it too bit the dust. \n\nHere is what I experience. Not every controller has all these issues at once, but they are shared across them. \n\n\u2022 Gittery\/spotty tracking.\n\u2022 Constantly connects\/disconnects rapidly.\n\u2022 One side of the controller will track facing the headset while the other doesn't. \n\u2022 Won't track at all\n\u2022 Won't track, and the lights on the rings stay on and never turn off. \n\nI am still able to pair and unpair the controller even with the above issues. These have occured on left and right controllers. \n\nI have tried every troubleshooting step on the website + more. \n\n\u2022 Replace battery. Leave out for 30 minutes\n\u2022 Unpair and repair the controller\n\u2022 Track in a well lit room\n\u2022 Restart Oculus\n\u2022 Factory reset Oculus\n\u2022 Change tracking frequency \n\u2022 Clean the sensors \n\u2022 That weird tin foil trick in the battery port. \n\u2022 Cleared space on the storage\n\u2022 Paired them on another person's Oculus (they don't work there either).\n\u2022 Disconnect all communication types (wifi, Bluetooth, etc.)\n\u2022 Banged them on the desk a little (I mean it's already broke what more can I do) \n\nI cannot find anyone with my issue and I feel like I'm going crazy. Like, I'm not irresponsible with these so why am I having issues and no one else. I got to be doing something wrong. I do swing the controllers in Beat Saber, but that's just like the air it's hitting, so are they that fragile? I sweat a lot, so maybe the sweat gets into the controller? That doesn't really sound like a thing. I really don't know. I gave up on replacing them after the 5th one (a lot, I know) and just don't play VR anymore. Please, can someone figure out why I keep breaking these?\n\nUpdate 1: Thanks to y'all's suggestions I looked inside one of the controllers and found oxidation.\n\n https:\/\/imgur.io\/a\/oWlxute\n\nI am fairly confident it was from my sweat.

If you're living in Europe or any other part of the world with different standards, please take that into consideration.\n\nFor the sake of avoiding pushing the discussion too far off grid, I'll avoid explaining the internal reason why certain ways are better than others. If you want to discuss such thing, you can do it in another post at your own discretion. What I present are just results which might surprise some or answers some general questions.\n\nAlso, I haven't tried that many possibilities, but the ones I have tried are seemingly popular, so bare with me that I might not have tried things with your exact idea of a setup. If you have tried another product or another setup and have interesting results, feel free to share it in a reply. Nothing hurts anyone (unless it's unsecure) from having more knowledge of the options.\n\n# Not-Tethered options\n\nFirst, on the **not-tethered** (or *tetheredless* or *free-of-long-dang-cable*) **options**, which mean you play PCVR with a separate PC connected via Air Link\/Virtual Desktop or just play the Quest 2 by itself with its own installed games.\n\n**By itself**, the Quest 2 last around 2h to 3h, maybe close 4h at most (that stretching it with minimal interaction) without any external battery depending on what you're playing and, if you consider the Air Link \/ Virtual Desktop option, drop that by 1h to 1.5h at least. Air Link \/ Virtual Desktop takes a huge load of power to maintain the HD quality and refresh rate between the device and the PC.\n\n**Using an USB-A (or USB Type A) connection Power Bank (or external battery)** with 26800mAh capacity, the result varied based on the output of said USB-A connection.\n\nI tried this model : [https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B0861R6SXY\/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o01\\_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B0861R6SXY\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nIt worked \"*fine*\" while using its supposedly 2.1A\/5V port, but doesn't exactly covered the requirement to keep the device close to fully charged constantly, but the results varied greatly based on what cable I used.\n\nI tried using 4 models of cables with this power bank and the:\n\n[https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B083KC67CD\/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o03\\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B083KC67CD\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nFor that \"double\" model, with the power bank, I only used the USB-C to USB-A 3m long cable of the set. In term of using a supposedly \"high speed\" charging power bank, after 4 hours, the Quest 2 was at around 73% (from being fully  charged) and the power bank was between 50% and 75%. (As the power bank uses simple 4 LED light to define its charge, it's hard to tell, but I can tell it wasn't at 50%.)\n\nI also tried a slightly shorter breaded cable by a company called AJNope which I know can truly support super charge as I use it to charge my phones which has large capacity battery (for phones) from &lt;20% to 100% in barely 1.5 hours, the same amount of time as the official super charge cable from the phone's company. With that cable, I did see a slightly better ratio between the Q2 and the power bank, but we're talking about a small difference where the Quest 2 was at 83% and, for the power bank, well same light patterns (but I think it was closer to 50% as it took longer to fully recharge from the same wall outlet using the same cable and power supply.) I guess you could try other USB-C to USB-A type cable that are branded with some kind of super charging tech for that matter.\n\nI also tried a couple of USB-C To USB-A cables from my phones which resulted in similar numbers to my AJNope cable, though the 3m cable did return the worse value in charge and my guess has to do with the cable loosing some charge over its length. (I know I wrote I wouldn't get technical, but we can't evade the subject there.)\n\nThen, what about **USB-C type of power bank** as USB-C has a much better standardization of output than USB-A which has various Gen, technologies and methods involved that varies on the output in both signals and power?\n\nTo make the my experiment relatively broad, I used this Power Bank:\n\n[https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B08729Z2JX\/ref=ppx\\_yo\\_dt\\_b\\_asin\\_title\\_o00\\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B08729Z2JX\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nAs it has the same capacity (a good one on top of that) of 26800mAh as my other power bank and, as a bonus, it has a % display, a better deal, right?\n\nWell, for that one, I first tried it best USB-A port and ended up with the same results with the same cable as the other power bank and the result was relatively the same and the number on the power bank were also similar to my assumption with the worse being the 3m cable where the power bank displayed 68% charge while the device was around 72%. But I got to admit that my activities weren't exactly the same between the game sessions, but was around the same amount on standalone and PCVR.\n\n**What about the USB-C to USB-C results? Will I finally reveal the results?**\n\nWell, as not to surprise anyone, the official Link cable wasn't able to keep the Quest 2 fully charged, but it only dropped to around 92% after 6 hours (3 Air Link + 3 standalone) and the power bank was around 52%. Again, I think this has to do with the length of the cable. There's a lost of power in a cable over its length.\n\nNow, I know some might feel like it's a waste to use the official Link cable on a power bank since I could just plug it directly in the PC, but I had to test it.\n\nOn a surprising matter, the official short cable that comes with the Quest 2 won the **not-tethered options** with a staggering 97% charge and the Power bank being at 48% after 6 hours.\n\n**From this, I guess we could say that, if you go for a non-tethered power bank option, your best best is a short USB-C to USB-C cable and a power bank that can charge a USB-C cable.**\n\n# Now, what about the Tethered options?\n\nThis is where it actually gets interesting as the results and best options actually wasn't what I expected and, for those who want to save a buck, you might be surprised by the results.\n\n**First, I tried using the 5 meter supposedly USB 3.0 extension + USB-C 3m cable** (actually, it's 2.0, with an AC plug sold separately to turn it into a kind-of 3.0 with a 3m basic USB-C cable)  on the amazon [link](https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/gp\/product\/B083KC67CD\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) I previously gave and plugged it into a USB-A Gen 2 charging port on a outlet splitter I got. For the sake of those who wonder, the outlet splitter is a *Smart WI-FI Surge Protector* by a brand called *Mercury*.\n\nNow, I know this is not Tethered as in Tethered to a PC, but I consider it Tethered as you do have to watch out for that cable running around your legs. It work closely just as if it was tethered to a PC via Air Link. (I must point out that I have an excellent Wifi D-Link router with 3x 5GHz and 1x 2.5GHz channels via 4 separate antennas which is physically connected via Ethernet to my PC and my ISP modem. Seriously, it's kind a of a waste on me.)\n\nSo, now, about the result. Well, **it was utterly crap** or, at least, if I wasn't plugging a AC adapter to the end of the USB 3.0 extension to give it an additional 5V charge rate which is kinda stupid because you need to find an AC adapter that can reach the outlet in the first place. (Remember, AC plug insert is on the USB-A end part of the cable where the USB-C cable plugs into and NOT on the part closer to the power source.) After barely 3h of gameplay, the Quest 2 was already around 48% charge when only using the 2 cables as-is. It's obviously better than no cable, but considering how cumbersome the cable is, the return in power is not worth it.\n\nOut of curiosity, I tried the official Link cable with the 5m extension and it was even worse. The power lost over that 5m (+ the USB-C type cable length) on top of the restrictive fake 3.0 power output is abysmal.\n\nWhat about if it's plugged directly into the PC? Well, the result were either the same or worse depending on what type of USB-A connection I used (I tried from USB 2.0 to USB 3.2. Only didn't tried 3.1 or any SS+30 or SS+40 because I don't have those on my PC case.)\n\n**Then I tried using the Link Cable onto my PC's sole USB-C port.**\n\nThis was the best stable experience I had as even with that great Wifi Router of mine while using Air Link, there are rare and few visual glitches now and then and my guess has to do with my PC's network port which is kinda basic. The charge rate though is not perfect, but we're talking dust against the other options. After 3 hours of PCVR, I was barely scratching that 96% charge rate.\n\nI'll point out that the drain rate is much greater when playing a standalone via Link to a PC (using the Link to only charge) than using the Link cable for PCVR. The drain rate of playing game on the Quest while charging via the official link cable is slightly less efficient than the last following method I tried.\n\n# The last frontier... and surprisingly the cheapest.\n\nThis option came to me as I was waiting for the first power bank to arrive from Amazon. I knew that I didn't had any long cable enough to play while plugged in a PC and the 3m + 5m extension (first I tried) was just bad that I didn't want to pursue with it. Even just the 3m cable isn't long enough from neither my PC desk (toward my office VR space) or from my living room's wall outlet toward my VR much better space.\n\nIn my apartment, the smoke detector aren't well placed. It's not that they aren't efficient, but that they are too efficient as ANY tiny bit of smoke from just making burger or even making toast makes it activate. I could relocate them after asking the proprietor (or ask him to do it), but I decided to do something simpler as let's just say that I'm still waiting for some other fixes and he keep forgetting about it. (The rent is super cheap, so I let it go.) What I do is I simply start a air fan toward the smoke detectors that pushes the smoke back into the kitchen which then can more efficiently be evacuated by the oven's outtake fan. No alarm and my neighbors aren't work up by my toaster at 3AM when I feel to eat some. Win-Win. Still, the issue I had with that is the location of the smoke detector as there's no wall outlet within approx. 8 or 9 meter in the corridor where I must put the air fan to push the smoke in the right direction. **Hence come the tool that made things so much simpler and stupidly cheap: an wall outlet extension.**\n\nI got quite a couple of those around my apartment because I always find a way of putting things in ways that hides every wall outlets. I got old ones from the 80's as well as new ones. Still, what I decided to try is, in my living room, I plugged into outlet splitter (as it has surge protection and warranty) I previously mention, I plug a classic common wall outlet extension, then I attach the official outlet charger that comes with the Quest 2 in that extension. Then I attach the official average lenght recharge cable that came with the Quest 2 into the charger, fixes both the recharge cable with the extension in a way that can be detached later, but remains secures if pulled using double sided smooth Velcro bands (as to not damage the cable). I attach the USB-C cable to my headset's strap with 3 modern IT wire Velcro bands (2 on the side next to the port on the Quest and 1 behind the head). you get those on almost any medium and high quality brand of PC or TV or Controller wires you purchase nowadays.\n\n=EDIT= I forgot to mention that the cable is hold on an utility belt I purchased some times ago for a Deadpool costume. The kind you buy in a military overstock store with the anti-static features and optional pockets. That was ironically the most expensive part of my Deadpool costume. Hahaha!\n\nI played for over 8 hours (with a few break obviously, but never closing any game) and guess what the Quests was at when I stopped playing? 99%. In fact, once I stopped playing, it turned 100% barely 2 minutes after I put it down.\n\nSo, for those who are on a budge and want to keep the headset charging while playing it, use a wall outlet extension (ideally plugged with a surge protection device between the outlet and it), secure it to the official charger that came with your Quest 2, use that average USB-C cable that came with it, secure the whole thing in case of pulls and voil\u00e0! **At least, this works in the US and Canada. Can't tell for the EU with its different standards on wall outlets and outputs.**\n\nI hope this will be useful for others.\n\nPersonally, my final verdict is this:\n\nI'm using my USB-C power bank if I want a pure non-tethered experience. Works really fine for the average amount of time I play in a day and by the next day, everything is at 100% or I can even not recharge the Quest 2 until it's lower than 20% as to properly maintain the battery cells.\n\nIf I plan on playing a lot of Air Link or if I plan on playing a game that doesn't requires me to move my legs around (or play sitted), Wall outlet extension it is. Takes only 2 minutes to setup and keep the juice flowing.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, the official USB-C Oculus 16' cable offers a better experience overall when doing PCVR, but as I prefer playing in my living room which as 2x more space than my office where my PC is located, well gotta cut somewhere. Still, I do use that cable when I'm developing my VR game on that PC though. Nothings beat having that headset plugged and ready to test. (Unity can't automatically play in the Quest 2 via Air Link while it can via a Link cable.)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":75492,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Powering\/charging the Quest 2 while gaming.

So I can keep an eye on incoming emails in Thunderbird on my PC while I watch a YouTube video on a huge display, all in Reality Browser.  And keep an eye on my kids in the passthrough at the same time.  Full how-to notes to follow...\n\nAnd here they are - \n\nIn the Reality Browser (Applab) you can create multiple browser windows in an AR space - it displays the windows in a passthrough environment. The windows can be freely arranged and resized as you wish.\n\nIt is also possible to have the screen (or screens) of a remote PC displayed in one of these windows for checking what's going on there, or for light remote control usage. For instance, on my PC I have multiple email accounts managed within Thunderbird. I also have security cameras displayed there. By having the PC displayed within Reality Browser, I can keep an eye on that stuff while also browsing the net in other Reality windows - and I can also see what is happening in the room that I'm in, via the passthrough environment. The audio from the PC is heard even if you have something like YouTube playing in another Reality Browser window so that helps you to be aware of any PC notifications.\n\nHere's how to do it.\n\nAssuming that you've installed Reality Browser and familiarised yourself with how it works - not hard! - you need to install the DWService agent on your PC or Mac. Go to https:\/\/www.dwservice.net\/en\/overview.html where the way it works is explained, and you can download the free agent. Install it and set up the agent, giving it a simple name (keep it short because you'll need to type it into the Reality Browser window later). At this point I would suggest that you try it out by accessing it from another computer or other device with a browser, to check it's working ok. On the DWService site there are excellent tutorial videos - I'd suggest watching https:\/\/youtu.be\/DUE8aTWfqsI for the basics of remote control. It's very simple really, but it's worth understanding the options and controls.\n\nNow you can open the Reality Browser app on your Quest device, and open a new window. In the address bar, enter https:\/\/www.dwservice.net\/en\/login.html and once you are there, I'd suggest bookmarking it for next time. You will be asked to enter your login details. Your account is the email address you used to create it. But here is the key to make it work in the Quest environment - you need to also add the agent name in the following format -\n\nname@gmail.com#agentname\n\nwhere \"name@gmail.com\" is whatever email address relates to your DWService account, and \"agentname\" is whatever name you gave to the agent when installing DWService on the PC. If you don't add that agent name after the hash, for some reason DWService will hang when accessed from the Quest.\n\nNow you can choose the \"screen\" option from the displayed menu (or whatever other option you want) and you should be able to operate the remote PC from there. You will find that the pointer of the right hand Quest controller is the mouse cursor. The Reality Browser keyboard should pass through to the remote PC. The resolution of the remote screen is not as high quality as you'd see in Virtual Desktop but should be adequate for most purposes. But if you need to zoom in on part of the screen, you can change the \"fit to screen\" option in DWService to \"150%\" and then move around the screen using the joystick of the right hand Oculus controller.\n\nAs always when something fairly simple is described in a sequence of instructions, this sounds complicated, but it really isn't once it is set up. The tedious bit perhaps is the need to type in your user and agent details and the password (8 characters or more). Well, if you create a Thoughtpad window in Reality Browser - get that from https:\/\/thoughtpad.designedbysandeep.com\/ - you can type the email address and agent name string into that just once, and thereafter copy and paste it into the DWService login page very easily. But for security of course it's best to simply type the password. Instead of Thoughtpad you could use Google Keep instead of course.\n\nIf there are any questions, do ask, but bear in mind I'm new to this myself!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":75515,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I am typing this on my remote PC, using DWService and Reality Browser 2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/ytzm0g\/i_am_typing_this_on_my_remote_pc_using_dwservice\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"oh_its_taku","author_created_utc":1668207454,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_r1mho0wq","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1668235452,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.OculusQuest2","edited":1668262068.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"ysytcw","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#cb00f5","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"fb6a254e-0fec-11ec-8f19-cecfa31ad22d","link_flair_text":"PC VR","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_ysytcw","no_follow":false,"num_comments":11,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/ysytcw\/which_quest_2_link_cable_should_i_get\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1673218047,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Getting a Quest 2 soon mainly for pcvr and I'm kind of in need of help in deciding which\/what type of link cable I should get with it.

It worked before but just stopped out of nowhere.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":70710,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Oculus and PC wont recognize each other","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/xo1oqi\/oculus_and_pc_wont_recognize_each_other\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":null,"wls":null},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"jddcp","author_created_utc":1421153626,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_kos6v","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1663360983,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.OculusQuest2","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"xg2ew5","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#ffb000","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"a64e8336-f943-11ea-a7ba-0e9162da605f","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_xg2ew5","no_follow":false,"num_comments":35,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest2\/comments\/xg2ew5\/nfl_pro_era_is_a_terrific_qb1_simulator_and_first\/","pinned":false,"pwls":null,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1665445225,"score":29,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":" \n\nI wanted to wait until I played all modes and played the game for several hours prior to giving a full review. For anyone who is looking for a full Madden style game where you control offense, defense and special teams this may not be for you. Also, if you want to be the Head Coach of your favorite team, this may not be for you. The point of this game is to experience what it's like to be QB1 of your favorite team and for that, it does a FANTASTIC job.\n\nWhen you start the game, you get to choose your favorite team (GO EAGLES). From there, you can customize your player, including equipment, name and number. You can also play as the current QB1. All of the REAL players are in the game on offense and defense. The game then takes you into a tutorial where Lamar Jackson explains the controls.\n\nAfter the tutorial, you are dropped into a really cool locker room with gear from you chosen team. You can physically walk around the room or use the joystick to move around. The room also includes a really large trophy room where all of the trophies you collect will be shown. For instance, there is a wall where you can collect game balls for each NFL team that you beat. Really cool. You can physically walk around this room as well and interact with your trophies.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nOFFENSE: As I said earlier, this is a QB simulator, so you only control the offense and only control the QB. The game is very realistic as you do not call the initial play but you have an arm wrist where you can swipe to different audibles (out of the initial formation). The play is called in your headset by the offensive coordinator. Each stadium looks like its NFL counterpart. In the Eagles stadium, I could see all of our banners hanging which was awesome. The crowd reacts depending on if you are on the road or at home (on the road can be crazy loud). Once you pick the play, the action begins. If it is a run play you must actually hand the ball off (the playbook even includes Read Option plays). The QB is free to scramble around and out of the pocket as well. If you throw an INT, you can go tackle the defender (which makes me wish they had defense). Throwing feels pretty good (especially if auto is off) but it is not perfect as it does not always go to the intended target. I have gotten significantly better after practicing in the separate practice mode though.\n\nDEFENSE: If you play a full game, you sit defense out but you can watch from the sidelines as the game is played. You can physically or with a joystick move around the sideline for a better view. You can also sim the defense to get back in the action. In close games, it actually feels pretty intense to watch your defense and hope they can stop the team if they have the ball last. While on the sideline, you have a clipboard where you can check stats.\n\nMODES:\n\nThe game has a Full Season mode and there is a Chalkboard in the locker room with tips for each game including players to watch out for. The game also keeps stats throughout the season for top players in different categories and NFC v AFC.\n\nThere is also a practice mode and exhibition mode where you can pick any match up for one game. There are several mini games which I highly recommend as a way to get your throwing and movement mechanics down. Finally, there is a multiplayer mode where you and several friends can play catch in a huge NFL arena.....my experiences have been (as many VR games) flooded with young kids but your experience may be different.\n\nCONCLUSION: NFL Pro Era is advertised as a QB1 experience. If you go into the game with that expectation, I think you will love the game especially if you are a NFL fan. If you want a more complete experience then 2MD is probably a better game for you. Playing as your favorite QB (or yourself as QB1) on your favorite team in their actual stadium is what VR is all about and I think NFL Pro Era has done a great job of translating the NFL QB feeling to VR. There are some glitches (some that Madden still hasn't figured out....like RB running out of bounds immediately on out routes....) and the passing could be tightened up some but all in all this is a game that every NFL fan should at least give a try.\n\n(Pro Tip: Graphics looks great but using a optimizer type app really makes it look even better without much of a fps hit)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"OculusQuest2","subreddit_id":"t5_2oxzzp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest2","subreddit_subscribers":70718,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"NFL
