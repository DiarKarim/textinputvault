This applies to both gaming and non-gaming uses. This makes me think either my expectations were too high when I got it or perhaps I'm doing something wrong. So I'm looking for advice on how I can make my VR experience better.\n\nI initially wanted to get it primarily for non-gaming uses as a productivity tool but have found that no matter what apps I use for VR desktop functionality I have issues with mouse and graphics lagging or issues with text being difficult to read. I don't have readability issues in non VR desktop apps, my oculus is hardwired into my PC when I do this so lag shouldn't be happening, and my PC, while not top of the line, is a good pc with solid specs. Are there other ways to use VR for productivity? Are there any apps that people might suggest? I've heard good things about Virtual Desktop but I don't wanna spend the money on it if I'm just gonna have the same issues.\n\nAs for gaming, I have a unique dilemma in that I am effectively disabled and am pretty much limited to gaming while in my chair. I tried a few rounds of Beat Saber and was in pain for a day as punishment for being audacious enough to think I could have fun while standing.

This applies to both gaming and non-gaming uses. This makes me think either my expectations were too high when I got it or perhaps I&amp;#39;m doing something wrong. So I&amp;#39;m looking for advice on how I can make my VR experience better.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I initially wanted to get it primarily for non-gaming uses as a productivity tool but have found that no matter what apps I use for VR desktop functionality I have issues with mouse and graphics lagging or issues with text being difficult to read. I don&amp;#39;t have readability issues in non VR desktop apps, my oculus is hardwired into my PC when I do this so lag shouldn&amp;#39;t be happening, and my PC, while not top of the line, is a good pc with solid specs. Are there other ways to use VR for productivity? Are there any apps that people might suggest? I&amp;#39;ve heard good things about Virtual Desktop but I don&amp;#39;t wanna spend the money on it if I&amp;#39;m just gonna have the same issues.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for gaming, I have a unique dilemma in that I am effectively disabled and am pretty much limited to gaming while in my chair.

There is little to no information on if this is possible for the dozens of us who still have Quest 1s and want to upgrade to a Quest 2 or 3. It is not only possible, but it\u2019s possible to both get the referral credit and keep your free bonus game, such as Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2. The Quest Referral Program, which lets you get the referral bonus within seven days of the device's purchase, and the bonus game offers work different, which is based on the account it's first activated on. I've chatted with Meta customer support and since you don't have a Quest 2 or 3, it is condoned and even suggested by their customer support since you're not self-referring yourself and you can't even have your own referral link unless you have a Quest 2\/3\/Pro attached to your account. \n\nThe only thing other than a smartphone you need is a separate email address to create a new Meta account.\n\nDisclaimer: This is based on chatting with Meta customer support and it\u2019s an official policy, it can change at any time (at the end of the day I am just a person on the internet passing knowledge along). Also, while I won't post my referral link in this post, if you're interested in using it, you can find it in the same post in the Oculus subreddit.\n\nIf you are upgrading to a Quest 2, skip past the --- section since at the moment there are no bonus games for purchasing a Quest 2.\n\n---\n\nImportant - If you are getting a Quest 3 and there is a free game promotion (such as Asgard's Wrath 2): Setup your Quest 3 with your primary Oculus\/Meta account. Once you login to the Quest 3 with your primary Meta\/Oculus account, you'll get an email confirmation saying to redeem the offer. Redeem it immediately; that way, the game will be registered with that account instead of the secondary account you'll create in a few moments. You can confirm in the Quest app store that the game is attached to your account (\"redeemed with your headset purchase\"). \n\nAfter you do that, [go to this link and delete the Quest 3 from your account](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/), you'll get an email confirmation that a remote wipe has been indicated.

Make sure you see [this page](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bd7hYH0) showing you're ready before moving forward (try the above step again if you didn't get that page).\n\nNow that your secondary Meta account has a referral attached to it, simply set up your Quest 2\/3 with this account. Upon successfully setting up the device, go to the \"Wallet\" section in the Settings tab of the Meta Quest app to confirm the $30 has been added to your account, it should have been immediately added to your account (it'll take 30 days for the sender to receive their $30 credit).\n\nWith your $30 credit, you can gift games\/apps to your primary account no problem. To make the credit go even further, you can utilize referral links for certain apps for a 25% discount, which will even be applied to apps gifted to your primary or another Meta\/Oculus account. I'll post my recommendations, with referral links, at the end of the post. *Before* you purchase any game, click on the referral link for that app and get confirmation for the discount to work. It won't work if you do it afterwards. Many people have posted their respective referral links in different subreddits, other websites, etc. \n\n\nWhen you want to gift a game\/app to your primary Oculus\/Meta account, find your primary account via your Meta\/Oculus username or email address. It'll caution you that you two aren't friends and to be careful, but simply proceed. If you're super cautious about it, you can send it to your primary email address and redeem the code in your Quest app. You have up to 30 days to redeem the code, otherwise it'll be voided and your secondary account will get a refund.\n\nOnce you utilize all your store credit, you can either sign into your primary account in the headset (you can have up to four accounts active in your headset, including purchase sharing), or do another [factory reset](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/) and set up the device again to have your primary account the admin for the headset. Don't worry, your purchases, gifted or not, will stay in your account.\n\nWhew, sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this guide will be of service to people!","author_fullname":"t2_797o4","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"How to upgrade from the Quest 1 to Quest 2\/3 and get the Quest referral bonus (and get your bonus game if you get a Quest 3)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18t5kzu","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703800141.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone posted two weeks ago asking if it was possible to upgrade from a Quest 1 to a Quest 3 while still utilizing the Quest Referral Program.

It is not only possible, but it\u2019s possible to both get the referral credit and keep your free bonus game, such as Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2.

After Ioving my Quest 2 but falling off a bit in 2023, I gifted myself a Quest 3 for Christmas this year along with a few games. \n\n1.  In terms of lenses, the leap from BinocularBoy to PancakeMan is as good as advertised. Closest thing I can compare it to is getting glasses to correct my astigmatism when I was in college. I always thought my vision was fine as a kid, until I put on those glasses for the first time. It\u2019s just crazy how focused and clear EVERYTHING is. Edge to edge. \n\n2. Field of View is a big step up on Quest 3. I feel like the VR worlds expand much further into my peripheral vision than they did on the Quest 2. Combined with the above mentioned flapjacks on my eyes, I feel less like I\u2019m looking through binoculars, and more like I\u2019m looking like a scuba mask, if that makes sense. Tetris Effect was a game where I noticed a HUGE difference in FOV. \n\n3. The resolution bump and added clarity is immediately noticeable. It\u2019s hard to isolate the displays from the hotcakes fronting them, but collectively, it\u2019s insane how sharp everything is. Again, going back to the Quest 2 feels like going back to my days sans glasses. \n\n4. The strap\/weight distribution is worse than the Quest 2. It\u2019s not night and day or anything,\nbut it feels like the jock strap squeezes my brain tighter and the goggles press down harder on my nose than the Quest 2. I\u2019ll live. \n\n5. The Wheel of IPD is apparently important. I messed with the slider a bit when I first set up the Quest 3. It all looked the same so I just kept it tuned randomly. I did notice a little rumbling in the tumtum that I never experienced with Quest 2. A kind gent in this sub pointed me toward an IPD app. Once tuned in, the nausea totally went away. \n\n6. Mixed reality is the REAL DEAL. I went in with super low expectations, expecting my surroundings to look like a 1996-era security camera from Eckerds. As a first stab at MR, it is way, way better than it has any right to be. Passthrough seems to have zero latency and the resolution is good enough for me to easily respond to text messages on my phone. When you\u2019re playing a game in MR, it\u2019s good enough to convince your brain that you\u2019re seeing objects overlaid into your actual living space, rather than a feed of your living space. Whole thing leaves me fully convinced that MR may have a brighter future than pure VR when it becomes compact enough to run this well in glasses or contacts. \n\n7. Battery life has been fine, so far. I haven\u2019t tested it heavily, nor have I deployed my stopwatch, but she seems to be putting out for at least two hours before demanding her juice. \n\n8. Lego Bricktales is ABSURD. I see a lot of posts asking what a good first VR experience to show someone would be. Bricktales is as close to photorealistic as I have ever seen in VR. It might be even wilder in MR, though it seems like the visuals take a slight hit. You can literally see the microscopic Lego logo molded into individual studs.  It is pure MAGIC\/dark sorcery to have a sprawling Lego set floating on your actual bed. Probably the most jaw dropping gaming experience for me since playing Astrobot on PSVR for the first time in 2018. \n\n9. Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 is next level.  I went into AR2 with tempered expectations as well. I knew the reviews were glowing, but it sounded kinda Skyrim-lite, and you always wonder if the game is being reviewed on a VR curb. I\u2019m about six hours now, and the fun and scale has just blown me away. Game reminds me of a combination of God of War, He-Man, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and a Disney ride. In the best way possible. I just grin ear to ear as the set pieces get wilder and the battles get bigger. If anyone is disappointed about how it looks on Quest 3, I just don\u2019t get it. The art direction is SO GOOD that I don\u2019t know if resolution and fidelity matters that much. When I\u2019m not playing this game, I\u2019m thinking about playing it. \n\n10.  The Spatial Audio is a massive step up from the Quest 2. People mention being blown away by the graphics in Red Matter 2. I booted it up, and what blew me away even more was the audio. The sound sold me on being there in the game even more than the visuals. I mentioned it above, but the first thing that keeps coming to mind is feeling line I\u2019m inside of a ride at Disney World.\n\nFor those on the fence about upgrading from a Quest 2, I can only speak for myself, but I think it\u2019s totally worth it.  To me, it\u2019s like the leap from the iPhone 3G to the iPhone 4s. Mixed reality is a true glimpse into the future. If you\u2019re a VR enthusiast, the lenses and resolution bump are game changers. Asgards Wrath 2 is a must have, and is bundled for free. Like the iPhone 4s with Apple, I really feel like the Quest 3 is the true realization of everything Meta has been trying to do in this space. \n\nSuper excited to hop back in tonight. Next on my list is figuring out how to take 3D videos with the headset (apparently it\u2019s possible), learning about something called Quest Game Optimizer that seems to be popular on the Quest 3, and trying out Painting VR. \n\nThanks to all the folks in this sub who have been providing great info on the Quest 3 over the last couple of months. Was actually going to go PSVR2 instead until I started to see all the love for the Quest 3 hear. 100% feel it was the best decision by a hundred miles.","author_fullname":"t2_72110vjf","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"10 Random Thoughts on Quest 3 + Games","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18rqdmk","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703647086.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi guys!

I went in with super low expectations, expecting my surroundings to look like a 1996-era security camera from Eckerds. As a first stab at MR, it is way, way better than it has any right to be. Passthrough seems to have zero latency and the resolution is good enough for me to easily respond to text messages on my phone. When you\u2019re playing a game in MR, it\u2019s good enough to convince your brain that you\u2019re seeing objects overlaid into your actual living space, rather than a feed of your living space. Whole thing leaves me fully convinced that MR may have a brighter future than pure VR when it becomes compact enough to run this well in glasses or contacts. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery life has been fine, so far. I haven\u2019t tested it heavily, nor have I deployed my stopwatch, but she seems to be putting out for at least two hours before demanding her juice. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego Bricktales is ABSURD. I see a lot of posts asking what a good first VR experience to show someone would be. Bricktales is as close to photorealistic as I have ever seen in VR. It might be even wilder in MR, though it seems like the visuals take a slight hit. You can literally see the microscopic Lego logo molded into individual studs.  It is pure MAGIC\/dark sorcery to have a sprawling Lego set floating on your actual bed. Probably the most jaw dropping gaming experience for me since playing Astrobot on PSVR for the first time in 2018. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2 is next level.  I went into AR2 with tempered expectations as well. I knew the reviews were glowing, but it sounded kinda Skyrim-lite, and you always wonder if the game is being reviewed on a VR curb. I\u2019m about six hours now, and the fun and scale has just blown me away. Game reminds me of a combination of God of War, He-Man, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and a Disney ride. In the best way possible. I just grin ear to ear as the set pieces get wilder and the battles get bigger. If anyone is disappointed about how it looks on Quest 3, I just don\u2019t get it. The art direction is SO GOOD that I don\u2019t know if resolution and fidelity matters that much. When I\u2019m not playing this game, I\u2019m thinking about playing it. &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spatial Audio is a massive step up from the Quest 2. People mention being blown away by the graphics in Red Matter 2. I booted it up, and what blew me away even more was the audio. The sound sold me on being there in the game even more than the visuals. I mentioned it above, but the first thing that keeps coming to mind is feeling line I\u2019m inside of a ride at Disney World.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those on the fence about upgrading from a Quest 2, I can only speak for myself, but I think it\u2019s totally worth it.  To me, it\u2019s like the leap from the iPhone 3G to the iPhone 4s. Mixed reality is a true glimpse into the future. If you\u2019re a VR enthusiast, the lenses and resolution bump are game changers. Asgards Wrath 2 is a must have, and is bundled for free. Like the iPhone 4s with Apple, I really feel like the Quest 3 is the true realization of everything Meta has been trying to do in this space. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Super excited to hop back in tonight. Next on my list is figuring out how to take 3D videos with the headset (apparently it\u2019s possible), learning about something called Quest Game Optimizer that seems to be popular on the Quest 3, and trying out Painting VR. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the folks in this sub who have been providing great info on the Quest 3 over the last couple of months. Was actually going to go PSVR2 instead until I started to see all the love for the Quest 3 hear. 100% feel it was the best decision by a hundred miles.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"e4918626-d2e7-11e9-806f-0e3099a1df84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","id":"18rqdmk","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Snoo5859","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18rqdmk\/10_random_thoughts_on_quest_3_games\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18rqdmk\/10_random_thoughts_on_quest_3_games\/","subreddit_subscribers":477036,"created_utc":1703647086.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"So, when setting up the Quest 3, the instructions say to turn the IPD dial until the text is sharp.

Both are high resolution headsets and I haven't seen many comparisons or answers to if it\u2019s worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to\/from. My intent isn\u2019t to compare the hard specs, anyone can easily Google the numerical differences, but instead look at the more qualitative aspects. As such, obviously all the below is my opinion and just how I feel, right or wrong. Also, if I missed something or there is anything you would like to know, just ask. Finally, my apologies if this post is long and rambly.\r  \n\r  \nJust some background on my reasons for purchasing the Quest. I previously lived in an apartment where I had a dedicated playspace to use the VIVE. However, last year I moved and my new place didn't have a convenient space to use the headset that was near my PC (I also got married and started a family, so space and time to play was very limited). So naturally, I stopped using the headset and it sat dormant for over a year. Fast forward to present day, the hype, specs, and reviews of the Quest 3 caught my attention, especially its ability to play PCVR anywhere with Air Link, so I talked myself into buying the headset. Prior to this, I had never seriously looked at Oculus headsets after Meta purchased them.\r  \n\r  \nMy VIVE setup: I purchased my HTC VIVE Pro 2 shortly after its release in June 2021. I have 4x HTC\/Valve base stations, 2 Valve knuckle controllers, and the HTC VIVE wireless adapter (I ran the headset both wired and wireless). FYI, I also had a Valve Index, but only for a very short period of time.\r  \n\r  \nMy Quest 3 setup: Quest 3 (128GB version), stock controllers, and using Air Link and standalone (I\u2019ve never tried the Link Cable).\r  \n\r  \nI use SteamVR for PCVR, running on a system with an RTX 3080, i7-10700, 32GB of memory, and 1TB M.2 NVMe. My network is ran on a WiFi-6 ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8) mesh system.\r  \n\r  \nNow, let\u2019s get into the comparisons and my thoughts:\n\n# Lenses, Screens, &amp; Resolution\n\n\rThe Quest has pancake lenses while the VIVE has Fresnel lenses. The pancake lenses are amazing and all future headsets should have these. The clarity across the Quest\u2019s FOV is so much better compared to the VIVE. There is some slight blurriness at the edges and when moving my head. The Quest has a very large and forgiving sweetspot while the VIVE has a very small and unforgiving one; the VIVE gets blurry fast if you\u2019re slightly outside the sweetspot. From a purely performance perspective, if you're perfectly in the sweetspot, then I give the advantage to the VIVE, it\u2019s clear and able to pullout more details with its resolution...but you have to be perfectly in it to get that advantage. With the VIVE, I constantly found myself adjusting the headset\u2019s position on my face while in game, re-centering the sweetspot. I don\u2019t find myself doing this with the Quest. From actual real world usage, I get a great visual experience with the Quest, that is more enjoyable.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t notice any god rays or reflections on the Quest. Unfortunately, this is the VIVE\u2019s Achilles heel, the god rays\/reflections really take away from the high resolution and overall picture enjoyment. For both headsets, I didn\u2019t notice any screen door effect, mura, or aliasing (I\u2019ve seen others mention aliasing on the Quest due to the canted screen panels, but it hasn\u2019t been noticeable to me).\r  \n\r  \nInterestingly, with the Quest, I have a hard time focusing on objects held closer to the headset (not sure what the Quest\u2019s focal range is) and have a hard time with the vergence-accommodation conflict. Example, while playing Half-Life Alex, I am unable to read the labels on items that I am holding at arms length while having both eyes open. This was not an issue on the VIVE.\r  \n\r  \nI haven't noticed any dead pixels on either headset (I\u2019m not going out of my way to look for them, such as using solid color screens. If I don't notice it during normal usage, then I don\u2019t care, nor do I want to know it's there).\r  \n\r  \nFOV &amp; Binocular\/Stereo Overlap\r  \nThe VIVE has a wider FOV feeling compared to the Quest. However, due to my face shape, both headsets give me a wearing a scuba mask feel. On the Quest, I have the rye relief in the furthest out position to help with vergence-accommodation noted above (and due to some discomfort of the edges of the lens pushing on my nose), which cuts down on the FOV further and makes the scuba mask feeling more pronounced.\r  \n\r  \nBoth headsets have pretty poor binocular overlap, but it is a little less noticeable on the VIVE.\r  \n\r\n\n# Comfort\n\n\rThe VIVE is far more comfortable and I able have the lenses very close to my eyes without any issues. It\u2019s no contest, however, my hot take is I don't think the Quest\u2019s stock strap is as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s also not this torture device its made out to be. My only issue is I get hotspot pressure points on the back of my head where the two adjustable sliders sit. I actually have more discomfort from the lens siting on the bridge of my nose, I have a narrow IPD of 59\/60, so the lenses are pretty close (I guess I have a wider nose as well). My only relief is to have the eye relief set to the furthest setting away from my face (which unfortunately narrows the FOV). The Quest\u2019s facial interface fabric seemed fine but its not as soft as the VIVE's.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Note: I did try the BOBOVR halo strap, but I didn't find it comfortable and it seemed loose\/moved around too much for my liking (I hear this is common for halo style straps). I would tighten the strap down (a lot) to help, but then the pressure on my forehead painful. I know I\u2019m in the minority for this. I ended up returning it to Amazon. Funny\/odd thing with the BOBO, the color wasn\u2019t really white, it was more of a very light gray (haven't seen anyone else mention this). I recently ordered the official Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap. I find it far more comfortable. I recently saw Meta halted the sale of these due to battery issues...I haven\u2019t had an issue yet, but its something to be aware of.\r  \n\r\n\n# Controllers\n\n\rThis is a mixed bag when compared to the Valve knuckles. I really miss my knuckles. I feel they had better ergonomics, comfort, and were a joy to use. The straps that hold your hands to the controller, so you don\u2019t always have to grip the controller, are so comfortable (these should be standard on all controllers). The finger tracking is nice as it just feels more natural to use your hands\/fingers to grab and throw things without pushing a button. The only downside is the curved hand guards where the sensors are located; they are a bit big and will bang into one another when your hands a close together.\r  \n\r  \nI like that the Quest\u2019s controllers are smaller and don\u2019t interfere\/ knock into each other when the controllers are next to each other. I just wish they felt a little better in the hand, were more ergonomic, and had the same hand straps as Valve\u2019s. I know Meta sells aftermarket hand straps, but $40 for a piece of fabric and Velcro is absurd. I did try some cheaper ones from AMVR, but there is a metal disc on the top of the strap dug into my hand, making it uncomfortable; and the forced hand placement, when the straps were tightened, placed your fingers in odd position with regards to the buttons. Valve controllers addresses this by having three different adjustable angle settings for the straps (I cant find any Quest add-ons that does this).\n\n\r\r\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o4l1cqqtla8c1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab50299e5a286ed7c5df363d60ee640dceb79224\n\n# \rSoftware User Interface and Ease of Use\n\nMeta really nailed this, it just works and seems well put together. I haven\u2019t had any big breaking issues or ran into major glitches (every so often the menu screen\/tablet will appear 10 yards away from me, vice being next to me\/or where I left it previously). The interface doesn\u2019t seem bloated. Boundary setup was easy, and worked as intended. I really like when you break a boundary, the passthrough actives and you can see your actual room. My only annoyance is I can\u2019t permanently delete an app that I purchased\/downloaded to my library (I can only uninstall them). E.g. I downloaded the Beat Saber demo and later purchased the full game and for some reason, Meta wont let me permanently remove the demo from my library (the demo is always visible in my apps library, even though its uninstalled).\r  \n\r  \nRegarding SteamVR and the VIVE, I didn\u2019t have many issues, but there were more than a few times where I would have to reset my headset to be recognized, reload SteamVR, base stations not being recognized, and I would have to reestablish my playarea every couple days, etc. (small things that just added up). The playspace boundaries never worked quite right on my VIVE\/SteamVR; sometimes it would activate and sometimes it wouldn't. At the end of the day, I always seemed to be tinkering with the setup before I was able to get into VR (I realize this is one\u2019s \u201clot in life\u201d when they are an earlier adapter of new tech, but just comparing that to where we are now with the ease of Quest 3). I also now have a family, so between them and my work, I don't have a lot of time to game anymore. So when I do get a few minutes or hour to do so, the last thing I want to do is waste time trying to get it running. This is one of the best selling points for the Quest, it just works without any fuss.\r  \n\r\n\n# Air Link &amp; VIVE Wireless Adapter\n\n\rI originally bought the quest so I could play my PCVR library in a different room from my PC, and Air Link seemed like the answer. When Air Link works, its actually very impressive. It seems to have minimal compression and I hardly noticed any artifacts. But sometimes it will lag and the graphics look like shit, which causes me to change over to a standalone game. It\u2019s inconsistent (even when right next to my PC and router), so the issues may be due to interference from other devices\/busy times of the day.\r  \n\r  \nBesides this, the biggest issue I have with Air Link is connecting it to SteamVR. Sometime I can connect the Quest 3 quickly and be in my SteamVR \u201chome\u201d in minutes, while other times I have to restart\/reconnect the Quest to my PC or restart Steam (sometimes multiple times). I just can\u2019t get the connection process to be consistent. \\*EDIT: Just saw the Valve released a Steam Link app for the Quest, I\u2019ll start testing that shortly.\r  \n\r  \nThe VIVE wireless adapter is a mix bag. Unlike Air Link, I need to be near my PC for the VIVE wireless adapter to register. I never had issues with stuttering, lag, or the wireless adapter overheating. It worked exactly how HTC designed it to, although getting the HTC software to recognize it could be a chore. However, the biggest issue I had with it was the amount of compression; the graphics took too big of a hit for me. So I only used it for a short time before going back to wired. I was swapping between wired and wireless based on the game I was playing, but changing out the cords on the headset is a pain in the ass. At the end of the day, the VIVE Pro 2 visuals and resolution are meant for wired to get the most out of the headset graphically (it\u2019s really the reason why you would buy this headset in the first place). On any other prior VIVE headset, the wireless adapter would be acceptable and worth it.\n\n# \rPassthrough\n\n\rNever used it on the VIVE (never had a reason to). The passthrough on the Quest is really cool and has so much potential, and it\u2019s good enough for doing basic everyday things without needing to remove the headset. It\u2019s one of the features that I was really intrigued and excited about, however, I feel that reviewers (especially VR YouTube reviewers that I follow), over-hyped and over sold it\u2019s capability. The passthrough is very grainy and has a lot of noise, and the warping near edges of items can be nauseating. I\u2019ve tried the Quest in different lighting, outside (careful to avoid direct sunlight on the inside lenses), in my kitchen, and living room and can\u2019t seem to improve it\u2019s visual quality (all these places look the same, quality wise, in passthrough). Its like a step below an 80\u2019s\/90\u2019s VHS camcorder.\r  \n\r\n\n# Sound\n\n\rBoth are good. The VIVE has a little interference background noise but it\u2019s not noticeable when in a game. This comparison comes down to, do you like something covering your ears or not. I prefer the VIVE version more, it offers a little more privacy and helps with immersion by blocking out outside noise. Earbuds are an option for the Quest but I\u2019m not a fan of having them in my ears for longer periods of time.\r  \n\r\n\n# Battery\n\n\rThe battery life of the quest is one of its biggest weakness. It drains fast and I usually get an hour or so out of it. This isn\u2019t a huge issue because I don\u2019t have time to play longer than an hour at most. But it is annoying when I forget to recharge it. The battery of the VIVE wireless is a power bank that straps to your waist. I had no issues with it and it held a charge for decent amount of time. Its quality is top -notch as it hasn\u2019t noticeably degraded over the years and it maintains a charge even when stored for a long period of time.\r  \n\r\n\n# Cost\n\n\rBoth are expensive. I paid $800 just for the Pro 2 headset alone. Add on the additional costs of the Valve controllers and base stations; and your looking at a small fortune just to play VR. In comparison, the Quest is a steal. But in fairness, there\u2019s about a two and a half year difference between the products, so the price should drop as the technology matures. The Quest 3 only seems expensive because the previous Quest 2 was so much cheaper. To give credit to Meta, it looks like they are selling the base 128GB model at cost, or more likely at a loss (so you are getting a lot of tech for the price of the 128GB model). But Meta really gouges you with their official aftermarket accessories. Their accessories are overly expensive, and all seem to be roughly double the price of the non-official variants (really taking a page out of Apple\u2019s book).\r  \n\r\n\n# Tracking\n\n\rI can\u2019t really complain or find many faults with either headsets. My VIVE setup tracks perfectly in any light condition and I never had a single issue. For the Quest 3, I haven't had tracking issues for 98% of the time. My only issues are it losing tracking in low light situations, and sometimes it\u2019s delayed\/slow when using Air Link for PCVR (not all times...only when Air Link is already running poorly), and once in a while it freak out when will set a controller down on my lap, essentially out of view of a cam\/sensor.\r  \n\r\n\n# Size and weight\n\n\rFrom pics, you can tell the VIVE is a chunky boy compared to the Quest, and it\u2019s also almost twice as heavy. In real world use, I don\u2019t notice the differences as the VIVE is very well balanced. The Quest is obviously more front heavy. And while Meta noted the Quest 3 was thinner compared to the Quest 2, it doesn\u2019t really seem that much thinner, even compared to the VIVE (only comparing the front housing with facial interface). It seems Meta wasn\u2019t including the facial interface when making these claims. At the end of the day, the Quest is smaller &amp; thinner, but not as much as the marketing would make you think.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6kmbf4irla8c1.jpg?width=2831&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fa8b8f584b381e0bd2fa1e84414c7cbf9cb58df\n\n# \rDesign &amp; Appearance of the Headsets\n\n\rTo be fair, I don\u2019t really care too much what a headset looks like. I don\u2019t display my headsets and I don\u2019t see it when using it...so who cares. But if I had to choose, I prefer the black and dimpled look of the VIVE. Credit to Meta, the white look of the Quest does standout as something different in the sea of dark colored VR headsets. The white looks clean and while I don\u2019t mind it on the plastic shell, I absolutely hate it on the fabric headband; it\u2019s too hard to keep clean.\r  \n\r  \nI also prefer the interface\/nose area design of the VIVE more. The VIVE has rubber flaps\/shades around the nose area that blocks outside light from getting into the headset from the gap between the headset and your nose; it works very well. The Quest lacks this feature and I find it odd that Meta didn\u2019t include them, or someway to block outside light. In reality, the Quest lets in a lot of light from this area, which can break the immersion you eventually learn to ignore it). I guess if I have to find a positive about it, then it would be that I can just look down through this gap to read text messages, orient myself to my room, or do other minor outside world activities without having to takeoff the headset.\r  \n\r\n\n# Final Conclusion: Am I happy and should you buy the Quest 3 if you have a VIVE Pro 2?\n\n\r  \nOverall, I am loving the Quest 3 and its gotten me really excited about VR\/AR again. It\u2019s not perfect but it is a great device. I was happy with my VIVE setup, but my life has changed and it had some shortfalls. My only regret is buying the 128GB version. I bought this version over the 512GB, as I only planned to stream PCVR games, so no since in paying $150 more for extra storage that I didn\u2019t plan to use. But after experiencing the convenience being able to instantly jump into a game, without having to get my PC running and connecting my headset; I\u2019ve come to realize that I am buying and playing more and more stand alone games.\r  \n\r  \nBut after all this, do I think the Quest 3 worth it over the VIVE Pro 2? If you don\u2019t have a VIVE Pro 2, then the answer is an easy yes, with a doubt (unless you have a hang up about the Facebook aspect). But if you already own a VIVE Pro 2, is it worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to the Quest 3? Well, that\u2019s a yes and no answer:\r  \n\r  \n**Yes**. If you have similar circumstances to me; you no longer have free time to tinker with the gear and setup, you just want an easy and seamless ability to play VR, and you can\u2019t play next to your PC. Additionally, it\u2019s worth getting the Quest if you want wireless PCVR with very few compromises or want to see the latest in consumer level AR. (Wireless play through Air Link and the pancake lens are reasons enough to buy a Quest 3).\r  \n\r  \n**No**. I\u2019m having a blast with the Quest 3, but in all honesty, if I still had the free time and still lived in a place where I had a dedicated playspace, then I don\u2019t think I would have bought the Quest 3. I don\u2019t think the jump is big enough to warrant getting rid of the still high end\/high resolution VIVE Pro 2, along with the base stations and knuckles. I would ride out this VR headset generation with the Pro 2 and wait to upgrade in the next gen.","author_fullname":"t2_6bb46e6l","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Review of my Quest 3 compared to my VIVE Pro 2 w\/ wireless - Should you

Pro 2 w\/ wireless - Should you \\&amp;quot;upgrade?\\&amp;quot; &lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I wanted to provide a review and some insights into my Quest 3, and more specifically how it compares to my HTC VIVE Pro 2. Both are high resolution headsets and I haven&amp;#39;t seen many comparisons or answers to if it\u2019s worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to\/from. My intent isn\u2019t to compare the hard specs, anyone can easily Google the numerical differences, but instead look at the more qualitative aspects. As such, obviously all the below is my opinion and just how I feel, right or wrong. Also, if I missed something or there is anything you would like to know, just ask. Finally, my apologies if this post is long and rambly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just some background on my reasons for purchasing the Quest. I previously lived in an apartment where I had a dedicated playspace to use the VIVE. However, last year I moved and my new place didn&amp;#39;t have a convenient space to use the headset that was near my PC (I also got married and started a family, so space and time to play was very limited). So naturally, I stopped using the headset and it sat dormant for over a year. Fast forward to present day, the hype, specs, and reviews of the Quest 3 caught my attention, especially its ability to play PCVR anywhere with Air Link, so I talked myself into buying the headset. Prior to this, I had never seriously looked at Oculus headsets after Meta purchased them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My VIVE setup: I purchased my HTC VIVE Pro 2 shortly after its release in June 2021. I have 4x HTC\/Valve base stations, 2 Valve knuckle controllers, and the HTC VIVE wireless adapter (I ran the headset both wired and wireless). FYI, I also had a Valve Index, but only for a very short period of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Quest 3 setup: Quest 3 (128GB version), stock controllers, and using Air Link and standalone (I\u2019ve never tried the Link Cable).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use SteamVR for PCVR, running on a system with an RTX 3080, i7-10700, 32GB of memory, and 1TB M.2 NVMe. My network is ran on a WiFi-6 ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8) mesh system.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, let\u2019s get into the comparisons and my thoughts:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Lenses, Screens, &amp;amp; Resolution&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest has pancake lenses while the VIVE has Fresnel lenses. The pancake lenses are amazing and all future headsets should have these. The clarity across the Quest\u2019s FOV is so much better compared to the VIVE. There is some slight blurriness at the edges and when moving my head. The Quest has a very large and forgiving sweetspot while the VIVE has a very small and unforgiving one; the VIVE gets blurry fast if you\u2019re slightly outside the sweetspot. From a purely performance perspective, if you&amp;#39;re perfectly in the sweetspot, then I give the advantage to the VIVE, it\u2019s clear and able to pullout more details with its resolution...but you have to be perfectly in it to get that advantage. With the VIVE, I constantly found myself adjusting the headset\u2019s position on my face while in game, re-centering the sweetspot. I don\u2019t find myself doing this with the Quest. From actual real world usage, I get a great visual experience with the Quest, that is more enjoyable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn\u2019t notice any god rays or reflections on the Quest. Unfortunately, this is the VIVE\u2019s Achilles heel, the god rays\/reflections really take away from the high resolution and overall picture enjoyment. For both headsets, I didn\u2019t notice any screen door effect, mura, or aliasing (I\u2019ve seen others mention aliasing on the Quest due to the canted screen panels, but it hasn\u2019t been noticeable to me).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, with the Quest, I have a hard time focusing on objects held closer to the headset (not sure what the Quest\u2019s focal range is) and have a hard time with the vergence-accommodation conflict. Example, while playing Half-Life Alex, I am unable to read the labels on items that I am holding at arms length while having both eyes open. This was not an issue on the VIVE.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t noticed any dead pixels on either headset (I\u2019m not going out of my way to look for them, such as using solid color screens. If I don&amp;#39;t notice it during normal usage, then I don\u2019t care, nor do I want to know it&amp;#39;s there).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FOV &amp;amp; Binocular\/Stereo Overlap&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIVE has a wider FOV feeling compared to the Quest. However, due to my face shape, both headsets give me a wearing a scuba mask feel. On the Quest, I have the rye relief in the furthest out position to help with vergence-accommodation noted above (and due to some discomfort of the edges of the lens pushing on my nose), which cuts down on the FOV further and makes the scuba mask feeling more pronounced.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both headsets have pretty poor binocular overlap, but it is a little less noticeable on the VIVE.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Comfort&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIVE is far more comfortable and I able have the lenses very close to my eyes without any issues. It\u2019s no contest, however, my hot take is I don&amp;#39;t think the Quest\u2019s stock strap is as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s also not this torture device its made out to be. My only issue is I get hotspot pressure points on the back of my head where the two adjustable sliders sit. I actually have more discomfort from the lens siting on the bridge of my nose, I have a narrow IPD of 59\/60, so the lenses are pretty close (I guess I have a wider nose as well). My only relief is to have the eye relief set to the furthest setting away from my face (which unfortunately narrows the FOV). The Quest\u2019s facial interface fabric seemed fine but its not as soft as the VIVE&amp;#39;s.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**Note: I did try the BOBOVR halo strap, but I didn&amp;#39;t find it comfortable and it seemed loose\/moved around too much for my liking (I hear this is common for halo style straps). I would tighten the strap down (a lot) to help, but then the pressure on my forehead painful. I know I\u2019m in the minority for this. I ended up returning it to Amazon. Funny\/odd thing with the BOBO, the color wasn\u2019t really white, it was more of a very light gray (haven&amp;#39;t seen anyone else mention this). I recently ordered the official Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap. I find it far more comfortable. I recently saw Meta halted the sale of these due to battery issues...I haven\u2019t had an issue yet, but its something to be aware of.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Controllers&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a mixed bag when compared to the Valve knuckles. I really miss my knuckles. I feel they had better ergonomics, comfort, and were a joy to use. The straps that hold your hands to the controller, so you don\u2019t always have to grip the controller, are so comfortable (these should be standard on all controllers). The finger tracking is nice as it just feels more natural to use your hands\/fingers to grab and throw things without pushing a button. The only downside is the curved hand guards where the sensors are located; they are a bit big and will bang into one another when your hands a close together.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like that the Quest\u2019s controllers are smaller and don\u2019t interfere\/ knock into each other when the controllers are next to each other. I just wish they felt a little better in the hand, were more ergonomic, and had the same hand straps as Valve\u2019s. I know Meta sells aftermarket hand straps, but $40 for a piece of fabric and Velcro is absurd. I did try some cheaper ones from AMVR, but there is a metal disc on the top of the strap dug into my hand, making it uncomfortable; and the forced hand placement, when the straps were tightened, placed your fingers in odd position with regards to the buttons. Valve controllers addresses this by having three different adjustable angle settings for the straps (I cant find any Quest add-ons that does this).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o4l1cqqtla8c1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab50299e5a286ed7c5df363d60ee640dceb79224\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o4l1cqqtla8c1.jpg?width=4032&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab50299e5a286ed7c5df363d60ee640dceb79224&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Software User Interface and Ease of Use&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meta really nailed this, it just works and seems well put together. I haven\u2019t had any big breaking issues or ran into major glitches (every so often the menu screen\/tablet will appear 10 yards away from me, vice being next to me\/or where I left it previously). The interface doesn\u2019t seem bloated. Boundary setup was easy, and worked as intended. I really like when you break a boundary, the passthrough actives and you can see your actual room. My only annoyance is I can\u2019t permanently delete an app that I purchased\/downloaded to my library (I can only uninstall them). E.g. I downloaded the Beat Saber demo and later purchased the full game and for some reason, Meta wont let me permanently remove the demo from my library (the demo is always visible in my apps library, even though its uninstalled).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding SteamVR and the VIVE, I didn\u2019t have many issues, but there were more than a few times where I would have to reset my headset to be recognized, reload SteamVR, base stations not being recognized, and I would have to reestablish my playarea every couple days, etc. (small things that just added up). The playspace boundaries never worked quite right on my VIVE\/SteamVR; sometimes it would activate and sometimes it wouldn&amp;#39;t. At the end of the day, I always seemed to be tinkering with the setup before I was able to get into VR (I realize this is one\u2019s \u201clot in life\u201d when they are an earlier adapter of new tech, but just comparing that to where we are now with the ease of Quest 3). I also now have a family, so between them and my work, I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time to game anymore. So when I do get a few minutes or hour to do so, the last thing I want to do is waste time trying to get it running. This is one of the best selling points for the Quest, it just works without any fuss.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Air Link &amp;amp; VIVE Wireless Adapter&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I originally bought the quest so I could play my PCVR library in a different room from my PC, and Air Link seemed like the answer. When Air Link works, its actually very impressive. It seems to have minimal compression and I hardly noticed any artifacts. But sometimes it will lag and the graphics look like shit, which causes me to change over to a standalone game. It\u2019s inconsistent (even when right next to my PC and router), so the issues may be due to interference from other devices\/busy times of the day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides this, the biggest issue I have with Air Link is connecting it to SteamVR. Sometime I can connect the Quest 3 quickly and be in my SteamVR \u201chome\u201d in minutes, while other times I have to restart\/reconnect the Quest to my PC or restart Steam (sometimes multiple times). I just can\u2019t get the connection process to be consistent. *EDIT: Just saw the Valve released a Steam Link app for the Quest, I\u2019ll start testing that shortly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIVE wireless adapter is a mix bag. Unlike Air Link, I need to be near my PC for the VIVE wireless adapter to register. I never had issues with stuttering, lag, or the wireless adapter overheating. It worked exactly how HTC designed it to, although getting the HTC software to recognize it could be a chore. However, the biggest issue I had with it was the amount of compression; the graphics took too big of a hit for me. So I only used it for a short time before going back to wired. I was swapping between wired and wireless based on the game I was playing, but changing out the cords on the headset is a pain in the ass. At the end of the day, the VIVE Pro 2 visuals and resolution are meant for wired to get the most out of the headset graphically (it\u2019s really the reason why you would buy this headset in the first place). On any other prior VIVE headset, the wireless adapter would be acceptable and worth it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passthrough&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never used it on the VIVE (never had a reason to). The passthrough on the Quest is really cool and has so much potential, and it\u2019s good enough for doing basic everyday things without needing to remove the headset. It\u2019s one of the features that I was really intrigued and excited about, however, I feel that reviewers (especially VR YouTube reviewers that I follow), over-hyped and over sold it\u2019s capability. The passthrough is very grainy and has a lot of noise, and the warping near edges of items can be nauseating. I\u2019ve tried the Quest in different lighting, outside (careful to avoid direct sunlight on the inside lenses), in my kitchen, and living room and can\u2019t seem to improve it\u2019s visual quality (all these places look the same, quality wise, in passthrough). Its like a step below an 80\u2019s\/90\u2019s VHS camcorder.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sound&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are good. The VIVE has a little interference background noise but it\u2019s not noticeable when in a game. This comparison comes down to, do you like something covering your ears or not. I prefer the VIVE version more, it offers a little more privacy and helps with immersion by blocking out outside noise. Earbuds are an option for the Quest but I\u2019m not a fan of having them in my ears for longer periods of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Battery&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The battery life of the quest is one of its biggest weakness. It drains fast and I usually get an hour or so out of it. This isn\u2019t a huge issue because I don\u2019t have time to play longer than an hour at most. But it is annoying when I forget to recharge it. The battery of the VIVE wireless is a power bank that straps to your waist. I had no issues with it and it held a charge for decent amount of time. Its quality is top -notch as it hasn\u2019t noticeably degraded over the years and it maintains a charge even when stored for a long period of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Cost&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are expensive. I paid $800 just for the Pro 2 headset alone. Add on the additional costs of the Valve controllers and base stations; and your looking at a small fortune just to play VR. In comparison, the Quest is a steal. But in fairness, there\u2019s about a two and a half year difference between the products, so the price should drop as the technology matures. The Quest 3 only seems expensive because the previous Quest 2 was so much cheaper. To give credit to Meta, it looks like they are selling the base 128GB model at cost, or more likely at a loss (so you are getting a lot of tech for the price of the 128GB model). But Meta really gouges you with their official aftermarket accessories. Their accessories are overly expensive, and all seem to be roughly double the price of the non-official variants (really taking a page out of Apple\u2019s book).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t really complain or find many faults with either headsets. My VIVE setup tracks perfectly in any light condition and I never had a single issue. For the Quest 3, I haven&amp;#39;t had tracking issues for 98% of the time. My only issues are it losing tracking in low light situations, and sometimes it\u2019s delayed\/slow when using Air Link for PCVR (not all times...only when Air Link is already running poorly), and once in a while it freak out when will set a controller down on my lap, essentially out of view of a cam\/sensor.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Size and weight&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From pics, you can tell the VIVE is a chunky boy compared to the Quest, and it\u2019s also almost twice as heavy. In real world use, I don\u2019t notice the differences as the VIVE is very well balanced. The Quest is obviously more front heavy. And while Meta noted the Quest 3 was thinner compared to the Quest 2, it doesn\u2019t really seem that much thinner, even compared to the VIVE (only comparing the front housing with facial interface). It seems Meta wasn\u2019t including the facial interface when making these claims. At the end of the day, the Quest is smaller &amp;amp; thinner, but not as much as the marketing would make you think.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6kmbf4irla8c1.jpg?width=2831&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fa8b8f584b381e0bd2fa1e84414c7cbf9cb58df\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6kmbf4irla8c1.jpg?width=2831&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fa8b8f584b381e0bd2fa1e84414c7cbf9cb58df&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Design &amp;amp; Appearance of the Headsets&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I don\u2019t really care too much what a headset looks like. I don\u2019t display my headsets and I don\u2019t see it when using it...so who cares. But if I had to choose, I prefer the black and dimpled look of the VIVE. Credit to Meta, the white look of the Quest does standout as something different in the sea of dark colored VR headsets. The white looks clean and while I don\u2019t mind it on the plastic shell, I absolutely hate it on the fabric headband; it\u2019s too hard to keep clean.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also prefer the interface\/nose area design of the VIVE more. The VIVE has rubber flaps\/shades around the nose area that blocks outside light from getting into the headset from the gap between the headset and your nose; it works very well. The Quest lacks this feature and I find it odd that Meta didn\u2019t include them, or someway to block outside light. In reality, the Quest lets in a lot of light from this area, which can break the immersion you eventually learn to ignore it). I guess if I have to find a positive about it, then it would be that I can just look down through this gap to read text messages, orient myself to my room, or do other minor outside world activities without having to takeoff the headset.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Conclusion: Am I happy and should you buy the Quest 3 if you have a VIVE Pro 2?&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am loving the Quest 3 and its gotten me really excited about VR\/AR again. It\u2019s not perfect but it is a great device. I was happy with my VIVE setup, but my life has changed and it had some shortfalls. My only regret is buying the 128GB version. I bought this version over the 512GB, as I only planned to stream PCVR games, so no since in paying $150 more for extra storage that I didn\u2019t plan to use. But after experiencing the convenience being able to instantly jump into a game, without having to get my PC running and connecting my headset; I\u2019ve come to realize that I am buying and playing more and more stand alone games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after all this, do I think the Quest 3 worth it over the VIVE Pro 2? If you don\u2019t have a VIVE Pro 2, then the answer is an easy yes, with a doubt (unless you have a hang up about the Facebook aspect). But if you already own a VIVE Pro 2, is it worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to the Quest 3? Well, that\u2019s a yes and no answer:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;\/strong&gt;. If you have similar circumstances to me; you no longer have free time to tinker with the gear and setup, you just want an easy and seamless ability to play VR, and you can\u2019t play next to your PC. Additionally, it\u2019s worth getting the Quest if you want wireless PCVR with very few compromises or want to see the latest in consumer level AR. (Wireless play through Air Link and the pancake lens are reasons enough to buy a Quest 3).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;\/strong&gt;. I\u2019m having a blast with the Quest 3, but in all honesty, if I still had the free time and still lived in a place where I had a dedicated playspace, then I don\u2019t think I would have bought the Quest 3. I don\u2019t think the jump is big enough to warrant getting rid of the still high end\/high resolution VIVE Pro 2, along with the base stations and knuckles. I would ride out this VR headset generation with the Pro 2 and wait to upgrade in the next gen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"e4918626-d2e7-11e9-806f-0e3099a1df84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","id":"18q1t0n","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"mtr5223","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18q1t0n\/review_of_my_quest_3_compared_to_my_vive_pro_2_w\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18q1t0n\/review_of_my_quest_3_compared_to_my_vive_pro_2_w\/","subreddit_subscribers":475187,"created_utc":1703445525.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"I remember reading about a third party app that was highly recommended, but I can't remember the name.

Swapping between the view in the headset and the view on my 4K monitor and it's seriously impressive how close they look to each other. \n\nNormally I game in 4K on my monitor and sit about a foot and a half away to get maximum detail and obviously the further away you sit from a display you begin to lose those details which is why a lot of people can't see the difference between 1080p and 1440p and 4K. Obviously when you sit very closely to your display you can see the differences quite clearly. So, I'm sitting about 5 foot away from the display here at the moment and as I said swapping between the view inside the quest 3 and view on my monitor there is not much difference at 1440P. It's something that you can do anywhere with a good wireless connection and not be tied to your desk and not feel like you're  compromising  on the visual quality.\n\n I'm not new to this I've been doing this ever since I've got into VR, my last headset was hp reverb G2 which had one of the highest clarity of all the headsets at the time. But the problem with the G2 was the tiny sweet spot meant that when you're playing in a static position looking at the entire screen as you would do in front of a monitor playing a game, the only bits of clarity were in the very centre so you'd have to keep moving your head around the screen to sort of maintain that clarity. That's a really unnatural way that you would be sitting there playing a game. You don't normally sit there moving your head looking around the screen, you just keep your head static and look forwards. What I'm finding now then with the quest 3 and pancake lenses and the fact that the resolution bump is high enough now that is a fantastic way to be playing games without being tied to your desk as I said seriously impressive.\n\n I recently did a preview of the new Xbox game pass streaming cloud app for quests unfortunately that is tied to streaming an Xbox console xbox One or Xbox Series S maybe an X in some cases and that quality is not particularly great compared to streaming off your pc. But this is the first time I've tried doing the 2D gaming on a large screen in vr with high pc settings on the quest 3. I'm wondering what the consensus is here now then let's say you have a 1080p monitor but your pc can probably push something higher to maybe 1440p effectively the quest 3 acting as your monitor would give you a better display than the 1080p monitor that you might have. Well that's pretty good stuff right there isn't it?\n\nI know a lot of people are gonna suggest well, vr headset is really meant for the vr experience and shouldn't really cater to desktop2D flat screen pancake gaming whatever you want to call it they're not the same and of course I agree that they're not the same but I've been playing the Luke Ross cyberpunk 2077 mod for quite some time in VR and whilst it's really cool, it's lacking details it has lots of artefacts lots of ghosting and you've got to really mess around with it to get that looking good. But now having tried playing the same game with the high settings and with ray tracing on you can't turn ray tracing on using the real vr mod because even an rtx 4090 can't handle that at decent resolution. So seeing all the bells and whistles on in 2D on the quest 3 it's pretty amazing stuff and I'm just sort of gushing about it now. I'm going to be trying some other games to see how they fare as well it just means that I can sit and game at really high settings without being at my desk I'm going to sit in the garden well not right now because it's pretty cold But you know I could sit in the garden, And have some really high quality gaming experiences without having to move my PC anywhere. And I think that in itself is pretty amazing stuff and it's not something that VR headsets have been able to really accomplish in the past until now especially with the fact that the quest 3 is a stand alone device that can handle that so I'm wondering why this isn't being pushed more as a feature.\n\nI mean it's all well and good having the Xbox game pass cloud streaming as a way to play 2D games on your  headset but that's as I said wasn't necessarily a high quality experience showing the best of what the headset can accomplish. so I just wanted to know what the consensus is here on this sub. I know a lot of people on this sub don't like PCVR stuff but it's quite an interesting development that I've witnessed here and I'm quite intrigued to know  where this is going to go because it's basically portable gaming much like you have a handheld device like steam deck or whatever handheld device strapped your head rather than in your hand and you're getting a high quality experience that's very portable . \n\nAnd  for the record I just like to say, that this entire post has been constructed from me using the microphone speech to text option in Virtual Desktop.

Swapping between the view in the headset and the view on my 4K monitor and it&amp;#39;s seriously impressive how close they look to each other. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Normally I game in 4K on my monitor and sit about a foot and a half away to get maximum detail and obviously the further away you sit from a display you begin to lose those details which is why a lot of people can&amp;#39;t see the difference between 1080p and 1440p and 4K. Obviously when you sit very closely to your display you can see the differences quite clearly. So, I&amp;#39;m sitting about 5 foot away from the display here at the moment and as I said swapping between the view inside the quest 3 and view on my monitor there is not much difference at 1440P. It&amp;#39;s something that you can do anywhere with a good wireless connection and not be tied to your desk and not feel like you&amp;#39;re  compromising  on the visual quality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not new to this I&amp;#39;ve been doing this ever since I&amp;#39;ve got into VR, my last headset was hp reverb G2 which had one of the highest clarity of all the headsets at the time. But the problem with the G2 was the tiny sweet spot meant that when you&amp;#39;re playing in a static position looking at the entire screen as you would do in front of a monitor playing a game, the only bits of clarity were in the very centre so you&amp;#39;d have to keep moving your head around the screen to sort of maintain that clarity. That&amp;#39;s a really unnatural way that you would be sitting there playing a game. You don&amp;#39;t normally sit there moving your head looking around the screen, you just keep your head static and look forwards. What I&amp;#39;m finding now then with the quest 3 and pancake lenses and the fact that the resolution bump is high enough now that is a fantastic way to be playing games without being tied to your desk as I said seriously impressive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently did a preview of the new Xbox game pass streaming cloud app for quests unfortunately that is tied to streaming an Xbox console xbox One or Xbox Series S maybe an X in some cases and that quality is not particularly great compared to streaming off your pc. But this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve tried doing the 2D gaming on a large screen in vr with high pc settings on the quest 3. I&amp;#39;m wondering what the consensus is here now then let&amp;#39;s say you have a 1080p monitor but your pc can probably push something higher to maybe 1440p effectively the quest 3 acting as your monitor would give you a better display than the 1080p monitor that you might have. Well that&amp;#39;s pretty good stuff right there isn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people are gonna suggest well, vr headset is really meant for the vr experience and shouldn&amp;#39;t really cater to desktop2D flat screen pancake gaming whatever you want to call it they&amp;#39;re not the same and of course I agree that they&amp;#39;re not the same but I&amp;#39;ve been playing the Luke Ross cyberpunk 2077 mod for quite some time in VR and whilst it&amp;#39;s really cool, it&amp;#39;s lacking details it has lots of artefacts lots of ghosting and you&amp;#39;ve got to really mess around with it to get that looking good. But now having tried playing the same game with the high settings and with ray tracing on you can&amp;#39;t turn ray tracing on using the real vr mod because even an rtx 4090 can&amp;#39;t handle that at decent resolution. So seeing all the bells and whistles on in 2D on the quest 3 it&amp;#39;s pretty amazing stuff and I&amp;#39;m just sort of gushing about it now. I&amp;#39;m going to be trying some other games to see how they fare as well it just means that I can sit and game at really high settings without being at my desk I&amp;#39;m going to sit in the garden well not right now because it&amp;#39;s pretty cold But you know I could sit in the garden, And have some really high quality gaming experiences without having to move my PC anywhere. And I think that in itself is pretty amazing stuff and it&amp;#39;s not something that VR headsets have been able to really accomplish in the past until now especially with the fact that the quest 3 is a stand alone device that can handle that so I&amp;#39;m wondering why this isn&amp;#39;t being pushed more as a feature.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mean it&amp;#39;s all well and good having the Xbox game pass cloud streaming as a way to play 2D games on your  headset but that&amp;#39;s as I said wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily a high quality experience showing the best of what the headset can accomplish. so I just wanted to know what the consensus is here on this sub. I know a lot of people on this sub don&amp;#39;t like PCVR stuff but it&amp;#39;s quite an interesting development that I&amp;#39;ve witnessed here and I&amp;#39;m quite intrigued to know  where this is going to go because it&amp;#39;s basically portable gaming much like you have a handheld device like steam deck or whatever handheld device strapped your head rather than in your hand and you&amp;#39;re getting a high quality experience that&amp;#39;s very portable . &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And  for the record I just like to say, that this entire post has been constructed from me using the microphone speech to text option in Virtual Desktop. Reason why I&amp;#39;m mentioning this is because it fits the whole portable not having to have your pc with you i.e keyboard\/monitor to be able to work and do stuff that you would at your desk. I think the speech to Text has improved massively to be able to do this.

There is little to no information on if this is possible for the dozens of us who still have Quest 1s and want to upgrade to a Quest 2 or 3. It is not only possible, but it\u2019s possible to both get the referral credit and keep your free bonus game, such as Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2. The Quest Referral Program, which lets you get the referral bonus within seven days of the device's purchase, and the bonus game offers work different, which is based on the account it's first activated on. I've chatted with Meta customer support and since you don't have a Quest 2 or 3, it is condoned and even suggested by their customer support since you're not self-referring yourself and you can't even have your own referral link unless you have a Quest 2\/3\/Pro attached to your account. \n\nThe only thing other than a smartphone you need is a separate email address to create a new Meta account.\n\nDisclaimer: This is based on chatting with Meta customer support and it\u2019s an official policy, it can change at any time (at the end of the day I am just a person on the internet passing knowledge along. Also, for transparency, I will post my referral links in the post.\n\nIf you are upgrading to a Quest 2, skip past the --- section since at the moment there are no bonus games for purchasing a Quest 2.\n\n---\n\nImportant - If you are getting a Quest 3 and there is a free game promotion (such as Asgard's Wrath 2): Setup your Quest 3 with your primary Oculus\/Meta account. Once you login to the Quest 3 with your primary Meta\/Oculus account, you'll get an email confirmation saying to redeem the offer. Redeem it immediately; that way, the game will be registered with that account instead of the secondary account you'll create in a few moments. You can confirm in the Quest app store that the game is attached to your account (\"redeemed with your headset purchase\"). \n\nAfter you do that, [go to this link and delete the Quest 3 from your account](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/), you'll get an email confirmation that a remote wipe has been indicated. Wait a moment and turn off\/turn on your headset. Upon bootup, the device will automatically restart on its own and will do a factory reset. (Continue with the steps below to utilize the Quest Referral Program)\n\n---\n\nIn the Meta Quest app, go to the settings section of the app and log out. You'll be prompted to login or create a Meta account. Click on \"continue with email\" and create a new Meta account, using either a spare email address including but not limited to via Gmail, iCloud+'s Hide My Email feature, or even [DuckDuckGo's email feature](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/email\/).\n\n*Before* you log into the Quest 2\/3 with your secondary Meta account, activate the referral program on your account via a referral link of your choice. [Here is my referral link if you need one or want to show your thanks for the guide.](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/referrals\/link\/darabo) :)\nMake sure you see [this page](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bd7hYH0) showing you're ready before moving forward (try the above step again if you didn't get that page).\n\nNow that your secondary Meta account has a referral attached to it, simply set up your Quest 2\/3 with this account. Upon successfully setting up the device, go to the \"Wallet\" section in the Settings tab of the Meta Quest app to confirm the $30 has been added to your account, it should have been immediately added to your account (it'll take 30 days for the sender to receive their $30 credit).\n\nWith your $30 credit, you can gift games\/apps to your primary account no problem. To make the credit go even further, you can utilize referral links for certain apps for a 25% discount, which will even be applied to apps gifted to your primary or another Meta\/Oculus account. I'll post my recommendations, with referral links, at the end of the post. *Before* you purchase any game, click on the referral link for that app and get confirmation for the discount to work. It won't work if you do it afterwards. Many people have posted their respective referral links in different subreddits, other websites, etc. \n\n\nWhen you want to gift a game\/app to your primary Oculus\/Meta account, find your primary account via your Meta\/Oculus username or email address. It'll caution you that you two aren't friends and to be careful, but simply proceed. If you're super cautious about it, you can send it to your primary email address and redeem the code in your Quest app. You have up to 30 days to redeem the code, otherwise it'll be voided and your secondary account will get a refund.\n\nOnce you utilize all your store credit, you can either sign into your primary account in the headset (you can have up to four accounts active in your headset, including purchase sharing), or do another [factory reset](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/) and set up the device again to have your primary account the admin for the headset. Don't worry, your purchases, gifted or not, will stay in your account.\n\nHere are some games I highly recommend for the Quest (with my referral links of course, but no pressure :) ):\n\n* [Beat Saber](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2448060205267927\/): The game so popular Facebook\/Meta acquired the studio. Think of it as a sort of Guitar Hero but with lightsabers. It's [very easy to mod the game and add your own songs, etc.](https:\/\/bsmg.wiki\/quest-modding.html)\n\n* [Eleven Table Tennis](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1995434190525828\/): Great table tennis game that has a new Mixed Reality mode.\n\n* [I Expect You To Die](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1987283631365460\/): A short but great \"escape room\" like game. All three games are well worth getting.\n\n* [Tetris Effect](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/3386618894743567\/): Think Tetris but on psychedelics. You'd think playing Tetris in VR would be kind of meh, but this game is surprisingly moving with clear passion from the developers. The developers have optimized the game for the Quest 3 with a graphics \"fidelity\" mode that makes the game look *much* better, almost exactly like the PCVR version.\n\n* [Walkabout Mini Golf](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2462678267173943\/): A fabulous mini-golf game.\n\n* [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2010043642376517\/): A fun party game to play with others. The developers have also added a MR feature that lets you see the people around you IRL that are giving you the instructions.\n\n* [Robo Recall](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1906871599408213\/): A great shoot-them-up rails game. \n\n* [Synth Riders](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2436558143118760\/): A great music freestyle game similar to Beat Saber in that regard. The developers have also added a Mixed Reality feature to the game for the Quest 3.\n\n* [Virtual Desktop](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2017050365004772\/): A way to remotely access your desktop and either do work\/productivity tasks or play PCVR games (if your computer supports it). It also supports creating multiple virtual monitors.\n\n* [Space Pirate Trainer](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1663790613725314\/): A great shooter game similar to Robo Recall. \n\nAnd last but not least...\n\n* [Virtual Virtual Reality](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2111191602278229\/): A great, fun narrative palate cleanser.\n\nWhew, sorry for the wall of text, but I hope this guide will be of service to people!","author_fullname":"t2_797o4","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"How to upgrade from the Quest 1 to Quest 2\/3 while being able to get the Quest referral bonus (and get your bonus game if you get a Quest 3)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18cnnlw","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1701924111.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone posted asking if it was possible to upgrade from a Quest 1 to a Quest 3 while still utilizing the Quest Referral Program.

I&amp;#39;ll post my recommendations, with referral links, at the end of the post. &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;\/em&gt; you purchase any game, click on the referral link for that app and get confirmation for the discount to work. It won&amp;#39;t work if you do it afterwards. Many people have posted their respective referral links in different subreddits, other websites, etc. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you want to gift a game\/app to your primary Oculus\/Meta account, find your primary account via your Meta\/Oculus username or email address. It&amp;#39;ll caution you that you two aren&amp;#39;t friends and to be careful, but simply proceed. If you&amp;#39;re super cautious about it, you can send it to your primary email address and redeem the code in your Quest app. You have up to 30 days to redeem the code, otherwise it&amp;#39;ll be voided and your secondary account will get a refund.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you utilize all your store credit, you can either sign into your primary account in the headset (you can have up to four accounts active in your headset, including purchase sharing), or do another &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/\"&gt;factory reset&lt;\/a&gt; and set up the device again to have your primary account the admin for the headset. Don&amp;#39;t worry, your purchases, gifted or not, will stay in your account.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some games I highly recommend for the Quest (with my referral links of course, but no pressure :) ):&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2448060205267927\/\"&gt;Beat Saber&lt;\/a&gt;: The game so popular Facebook\/Meta acquired the studio. Think of it as a sort of Guitar Hero but with lightsabers. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/bsmg.wiki\/quest-modding.html\"&gt;very easy to mod the game and add your own songs, etc.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1995434190525828\/\"&gt;Eleven Table Tennis&lt;\/a&gt;: Great table tennis game that has a new Mixed Reality mode.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/1987283631365460\/\"&gt;I Expect You To Die&lt;\/a&gt;: A short but great &amp;quot;escape room&amp;quot; like game.

You&amp;#39;d think playing Tetris in VR would be kind of meh, but this game is surprisingly moving with clear passion from the developers. The developers have optimized the game for the Quest 3 with a graphics &amp;quot;fidelity&amp;quot; mode that makes the game look &lt;em&gt;much&lt;\/em&gt; better, almost exactly like the PCVR version.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2462678267173943\/\"&gt;Walkabout Mini Golf&lt;\/a&gt;: A fabulous mini-golf game.&lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2010043642376517\/\"&gt;Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes&lt;\/a&gt;: A fun party game to play with others.

TLDR : Really just wanted to say that I'm an entirely satisfied customer, because so many posts here are complaints ! I'm not doubting others experiences, but mine has no dead pixels or any other technical faults at all. Works perfectly. One week on and it still feels like an incredible device.\n\nI bought this as a 40th birthday present to myself, upgrading from a Quest 1 which I used pretty much daily (I've also used a Quest 2 in work a little). Loved it, but this is like the switch from standard to high definition. There's really no going back.\n\nSome details :\n\n**1) Screen display** quality is crystal clear. Screen door is all but gone. Some pixilation if you're looking for it, noticeable (but never a problem) in special circumstances but not at all in 95% of gaming situations. True, the black levels on the Q1 are better, but honestly this only makes much of a difference in dark-dominated games. Most of the time the colours, contrast, sharpness and focus of the Q3 are a massive upgrade. No blur near the edges of the screen at all.\n\n**2) Passthrough.** Yep, it's grainy, but nope, it's not just like the Q2 but in colour (some warping, but significantly less than either the Q1 or Q2). I can read my phone on it without much difficulty - heck, I can type messages on my phone without problems. I think the issue here is not really one of resolution but sensitivity : I can read quite small text in the right lighting, but things get grainy if it's dim. Still, more than good enough to get the job done, if not as good as I would like.\n\nGotta add here that trying the mixed reality setup demo was incredible, equivalent to the first time I ever tried VR. A truly amazing \"wow !\" moment despite the limitations ! Looking forward to more of this in the future, even if there's not much mixed reality content right now. This... feels like the future.\n\n**3) Sound.** Absolutely 10\/10 superb. I no longer feel any need to use headphones and that alone makes it a lot more convenient to use.\n\n**4) Controllers.** Much more comfortable thanks to the lack of rings and dedicated thumb space. Tracking is perfect. I play Holopoint regularly for exercise, which requires both speed and precision and haven't experienced a single tracking issue. \n\n**5) PCVR.** Doesn't seem to be mentioned very much but I find this a huge step change from the Q1. I can now play everything wirelessly at (very) near-cable quality. No stuttering whatsoever. Nothing. Occasionally a little blurry for long-distance objects, but I haven't even changed any of my Virtual Desktop settings from the defaults.\n\n**6) Productivity**. I tried Immersed on the Q1 but found the screen resolution and comfort a real barrier here. Only had chance for a quick try on the Q3 but I'm very intrigued by this so far. Resolution is easily enough that I feel like I have a series of actual giant monitors in front of me, to the point I will voluntarily watch videos on this for the big-screen effect, not just for the gimmick.\n\nTried doing some actual work on this and I was impressed. The display quality is easily enough for astronomical source extraction, which is a challenging task for any monitor. The problem is there is one fly in the ointment, which brings me on to my final point...\n\n**7) Comfort.** Yes, it's closer to your face, but the strap is far worse than the Q1, so any benefit here is lost. Not noticeable for a few minutes, but after \\~15 minutes or so you start to feel the tension. About an hour is as much as I can manage so far (negating the need to discuss the battery). With the Q1, a counterweight on the back worked wonders (I could happily wear it for 2 hours), but this doesn't help as much with the Q3 probably because of the fabric strap. Not sure if I'll be able to tweak this to something better or I'll need to spring for an upgrade.\n\nI also added my silicon cover I bought for a few euros for the Q1, fits the Q3 just as well. The adjustable interface makes me happy to use this wearing glasses without the lens rings I added to the Q1, though I still remove them during exercise games just for peace of mind. Apart from the strap, which is admittedly a big deal, I don't have any comfort issues.\n\nAll in all I'm thoroughly impressed.

I've also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I've updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.\n\nIt's been a very long time since I've updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can't quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I've decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I'll only go into the main ones here.\n\n# OpenXR Update\n\n**Core SDK is now OpenXR**\n\nSo if you follow any VR news you'll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR. I've removed these and replaced them with the OpenXR system.  \n\n\n**Advantages of OpenXR**\n\nOpenXR is in constant development with improvements that will carry down to all headsets.  \n\n\nYou will be able to use your headset with the VR front you desire. OpenXR is fully compatible with SteamVR, Oculus Store and Windows Mixed Reality Portal. This means when using Whirligig from Steam you are not forced to use SteamVR. With direct support from each platform any performance improvements those platforms use will be filtered down into Whirligig.  \n\n\nOpenXR implementation has meant I've removed the input options for both Oculus and Steam replacing it with a universal controller and some core controllers to use. You could select different controller skins when using Oculus. Now this feature is available on all setups.  \n\n\nQuicker updates to other platforms. As all builds have been brought under one sdk I can now release the same version on different platforms with little change to the code. This will help to reduce bugs being introduced into other versions when updating and help my confidence that when I update I won't be breaking everyone's experience.  \n\n\nI can develop for both PC and Mobile headsets at the same time.  \n\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nOpenXR is new and in constant flux. For development this is both advantages and crippling as currently every update to the SDK can cause issues in multiple ways. This will improve greatly over time but currently it's making supporting some headsets (mostly mobile headsets) quite difficult.  \n\n\nSome features aren't working. Basically the UserPresent (what happens when the headset is put on or removed) feature isn't working properly. I will be implementing this back in once it's back up and running. \n\n# VLC VideoLan plugin update\n\nWhirligig offers 4 video path options to allow for the largest range of compatibility, Media Foundation, WinRT, Directshow and VideoLan. Media Foundation, WinRT and Directshow are available using the AVPro Renderheads plugin which is well supported by the developers, however the plugin that ran the VLC VideoLan support was no longer supported I have replaced the old plugin with an official VLC Video plugin made by the VideoLan guys themselves. This is much better supported and provides a host of improvements over the previous plugin.  \n\n\n**VLC VideoLan integration improvements**  \n\n\n* Greatly improved performance when using VLC video path (GPU decoding).  \n\n* Using the latest VLC dlls, which provides the widest and most up to date media support.  \n\n* Extra image support. Whirligig now supports xcf, gif, tiff, tif, ilbm, pcx, tga, bmp, pnm, webp, bpg, jpeg, jpg, jps, png, pns image formats. If there are any file types that I've not included but VLC does let me know and I'll add it to the list.  \n\n\n# Future use of the VLC plugin\n\nThe official VLC plugin supports all the same features that the VLC player has, which allows me to open up other areas of support. The biggest one will be playback of streaming media from external locations. This will be more significant for mobile Whirligig as network playback support is often requested. There are several other additions I wish to look into but if anyone else has any ideas let me know.\n\n# Explorer improvements\n\nThe explorer in Whirligig has been functional but has needed updating for a while.

When playing audio if you select one of these backgrounds, the environment will move and pulse to the audio as it plays. The audio backgrounds are 3D 360 environments and there are currently 7 to choose from.  \n \n\n[Audio backgrounds](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901b9c5c08d5007cb726496fba3ae90f129d90e9)\n\n Currently it only works with Media Foundation and WinRT video paths for playing back audio.\n\n# Optimisation\n\nA significant amount of my time has been put into optimisation of code, especially in the input detection system I've created. Whirligig should now be snappier and feel smoother.\n\n# Engine and plugin updates\n\nWith VR being in constant development, keeping everything up to date is a must to ensure compatibility and gain performance improvements from the latest OpenXR versions. This version of Whirligig is currently running on Unity 2022.3.13f1 (as of release the latest 2022 version) and OpenXR 1.9.1.\n\n# Bug fixes\n\nI've continued to fix reported bugs and any bugs I've come across as I go along. With the major updates that I've been making there is always a chance I've broken things so any reports on issues are very welcome.\n\n# Additional Releases\n\nWhirligig is available on multiple platforms and multiple headsets and this release is going to signify an update release on all of the platforms bringing every version in line with each other.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to betas I mostly release these on Steam so for beta versions Steam is the place to go. Sadly there isn't a universal store for Standalone VR yet so I've provided Ich.io for sideloading on some headsets and will be adding Whirligig to each of the manufactures stores if I can be accepted onto them.  \n\n\nI've always held a policy that if you own Whirligig on any other platform you can request a code of another platform for free. Here is a list of the current platforms Whirligig is on  \n\n\n**PC VR**  \n\n\n* Steam Store  \n\n* Oculus Store  \n\n* Viveport  \n\n* Pimax Store  \n\n\n**Mobile VR**  \n\n\n* Applabs (Quest 2\/3)  \n\n* Ich.io (Quest 2\/3, Oculus Go, Pico)  \n\n* Pimax Store (Pimax Crystal)  \n\n\nIf you have Whirligig on any of these stores and wish to access one of the other stores email me phileday@yahoo.co.uk with proof of purchase (Screenshot of it in your library or something like that) and I'll send you a code for the store you wish.  \n\n\nHopefully all the updates I've been making will improve the ability for me to support more headsets so keep an eye out for new headset support in the future.\n\n# Your feedback\n\nI am very happy to get feedback from the people who use Whirligig and most fixes and new features come from suggestions from all of you. If you have any suggestions or issues please let me know (comment here or post in the forum) and I'll do my best to implement and fix things. I want to continue to develop Whirligig into the foreseeable future so ways I can improve it for your needs the better.  \n\n\n# User reviews\n\nOne of the reasons I've not updated on the Oculus Store in so long is because of the chances of getting bad reviews. I'm aware I've made very large improvements and changes over the last default release but here is where the issue lies. Because it's such a big jump it can really frustrate people who were expecting to load Whirligig in the same way as before and are presented with an update. This normally throws out a few bad reviews off the bat.\n\nSo I'm just asking that if you like the update and you're happy with Whirligig please review it. If you don't a negative review is fine however please be constructive so I can address any problems you have.\n\nPositive reviews really do matter to me as it tells me that I'm continuing to improve things and make a good product. This is also true for negative feedback when it is constructive as it allows me to address the issues that are brought up. If you do write a review whether it's negative or positive I'll do my best to address any issues or improve Whirligig as best as I can. I look forward to your feedback :)\n\n# And finally \n\nI'd just like to thank everyone who has supported this project (just by purchasing you're supporting and positive reviews are always welcome). Without the community who has commented, made suggestions and reported bugs I wouldn't of continued to develop Whirligig. This is all very appreciated.  \n\n\nI hope you like the new update and I wish everyone happiness for the future. Keep watching :)  \n\n\nPhil \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_p6s1i","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Whirligig update with some major additions","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Developer) - Standalone"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":108,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"media_metadata":{"pc1hnjkgqx1c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":86,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da7b2eb16bd2a169581cc7a8c04fc1cba5e1a48b"},{"y":173,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4fb15191113ff38d757390aea2ed6f3d57e9ba0"},{"y":256,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a669f2ca8b3754872f398c91e0e70d962666e020"},{"y":512,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=619cbc100fea67fb235dc3bfe7870e76084eb379"}],"s":{"y":670,"x":836,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pc1hnjkgqx1c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=901b9c5c08d5007cb726496fba3ae90f129d90e9"},"id":"pc1hnjkgqx1c1"},"mkssguy6qx1c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c24d17d23bc82d0f8ba555602a5e38f0c7802c69"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7e00fe4e6bea58775401d0e98f0e5798cdc53df"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=109ba91bdddb09c022384e41cb5cfbb8a5317ac4"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19773c050285a665e8b1964286037f0b5e0c4261"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9c7fe463dce7e507692abff0935c3c62f7131d5"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ed8d2ecb7f539dfdea93efbc49b7c579c5fc424"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a3878d03261a47e414640f380c628baf8837d64"},"id":"mkssguy6qx1c1"},"z4mh8md8qx1c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb052d0de850d4f6679676f6c16ee4ea75ad33bc"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f94721ab5a8af366aeef68c4578f4c6f323ab4d1"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ffb1075d143b643e66a13212d0362133a36c57b"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c9d8f6c129df4e733f46959ac41fc1f6b611e2d"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f939cd9fbe78dde8cbe23ffa9ce960c2cac6f1a7"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50bd4fd8737341d697e9fcbd5c647cbfa5b4659d"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=80af511ea6da767fda034ed4de0d54d270dd64fd"},"id":"z4mh8md8qx1c1"}},"name":"t3_181fno7","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":140,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer) - Standalone","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/GHd4bDA9BRIxGUg2myj8WseaYy4PSw4CbTVEVbgbTvU.jpg","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700676713.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly before I go on, I recreated this post from the news update I did on Steam as I updated the steam default build first. I&amp;#39;ve also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I&amp;#39;ve updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a very long time since I&amp;#39;ve updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can&amp;#39;t quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I&amp;#39;ve decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I&amp;#39;ll only go into the main ones here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;OpenXR Update&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core SDK is now OpenXR&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you follow any VR news you&amp;#39;ll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR. I&amp;#39;ve removed these and replaced them with the OpenXR system.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of OpenXR&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR is in constant development with improvements that will carry down to all headsets.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be able to use your headset with the VR front you desire. OpenXR is fully compatible with SteamVR, Oculus Store and Windows Mixed Reality Portal. This means when using Whirligig from Steam you are not forced to use SteamVR. With direct support from each platform any performance improvements those platforms use will be filtered down into Whirligig.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR implementation has meant I&amp;#39;ve removed the input options for both Oculus and Steam replacing it with a universal controller and some core controllers to use. You could select different controller skins when using Oculus. Now this feature is available on all setups.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quicker updates to other platforms. As all builds have been brought under one sdk I can now release the same version on different platforms with little change to the code. This will help to reduce bugs being introduced into other versions when updating and help my confidence that when I update I won&amp;#39;t be breaking everyone&amp;#39;s experience.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can develop for both PC and Mobile headsets at the same time.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR is new and in constant flux. For development this is both advantages and crippling as currently every update to the SDK can cause issues in multiple ways. This will improve greatly over time but currently it&amp;#39;s making supporting some headsets (mostly mobile headsets) quite difficult.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some features aren&amp;#39;t working. Basically the UserPresent (what happens when the headset is put on or removed) feature isn&amp;#39;t working properly. I will be implementing this back in once it&amp;#39;s back up and running. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VLC VideoLan plugin update&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whirligig offers 4 video path options to allow for the largest range of compatibility, Media Foundation, WinRT, Directshow and VideoLan. Media Foundation, WinRT and Directshow are available using the AVPro Renderheads plugin which is well supported by the developers, however the plugin that ran the VLC VideoLan support was no longer supported I have replaced the old plugin with an official VLC Video plugin made by the VideoLan guys themselves. This is much better supported and provides a host of improvements over the previous plugin.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VLC VideoLan integration improvements&lt;\/strong&gt;  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greatly improved performance when using VLC video path (GPU decoding).  &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the latest VLC dlls, which provides the widest and most up to date media support.  &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra image support. Whirligig now supports xcf, gif, tiff, tif, ilbm, pcx, tga, bmp, pnm, webp, bpg, jpeg, jpg, jps, png, pns image formats. If there are any file types that I&amp;#39;ve not included but VLC does let me know and I&amp;#39;ll add it to the list.  &lt;\/p&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Future use of the VLC plugin&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The official VLC plugin supports all the same features that the VLC player has, which allows me to open up other areas of support. The biggest one will be playback of streaming media from external locations. This will be more significant for mobile Whirligig as network playback support is often requested. There are several other additions I wish to look into but if anyone else has any ideas let me know.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Explorer improvements&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The explorer in Whirligig has been functional but has needed updating for a while. I&amp;#39;ve redesigned a good part of it, worked on optimisations and fixed any bugs I&amp;#39;ve come across.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mkssguy6qx1c1.png?width=1193&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=6a3878d03261a47e414640f380c628baf8837d64\"&gt;Explorer text based&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z4mh8md8qx1c1.png?width=1193&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=80af511ea6da767fda034ed4de0d54d270dd64fd\"&gt;explorer visual explorer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Audio reactive backgrounds&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I am using media playback systems that also support audio I&amp;#39;ve worked on adding audio reactive backgrounds to the player.

It's worth considering other options, if possible, and if you can find a doctor who can help.\n\u00a0\n\nThe long story.\n\u00a0\n\nI'd like to share my experience in case it's useful for other visually handicapped people. Of course, our vision issues can be very different. Still, this might help you to consider possible caveats before buying a VR headset.\n\u00a0\n\nI have been visually handicapped since birth. In simple terms, my optic nerve \"does not have enough resolution\" and I need to bring everything closer to my eyes to see better. In addition, I have near-sightedness. For near vision, I don't need glasses, my best viewing range is 20 - 30cm. When I was young, I could focus even closer, at 10cm.\u00a0\nMy distance vision is tricky though. After 50cm, my vision can be improved with myopia glasses. However, it is known that negative diopters make things both sharper and smaller. For a person with healthy optic nerves, seeing things smaller is not an issue, they just need to remove blurriness.\n\u00a0\n\nBut in my case, smaller means less readable because of my optic nerve issues. So, I use my distance prescription only outside of the home when I want to see things sharper (which relieves the eyestrain greatly) but not necessarily to be able to read stuff.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDoctors usually tended to give too strong prescriptions, which seemed OK at the doctor's office but were too difficult to get used to and wear outside. So, after reading a few books on optometry and figuring out my problem and why it was so difficult to come up with a good prescription in my case, I bought an optometry trial lens set with a frame to experiment at home. When I achieved the most comfortable and safe lens combination, I verified it with a doctor to get my prescription.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBeing a programmer and a huge fan of VR sci-fi movies, I have always wanted to try out VR, but I was afraid it would not work well for my eyes. So I started it cheap. I bought a Google cardboard-based VR headset together with RiftCat software. The headset had an important feature - you could move its lenses back and forth, thus changing its focus a bit.\n\u00a0\nSo, when I tried it I was impressed. I could adjust the lens distance from the screen (my Android phone) in order to see things clearly. I later found out that Cardboard lenses usually have a focus length of about 50cm, which explains why I did not need glasses. Of course, there were other issues to deal with - small HUD texts in games, etc., but I was mostly interested in archviz stuff and custom simulations and environments. Still, I wish there was a zoom option for HUD and menus in every VR game.\n\u00a0\nAnd now, based on my positive Cardboard experience, I bought Quest 3. When I turned it on, I got worried a lot. It was so unpleasantly blurry! I'm used to seeing things blurry in the distance all of my life, but this was different because of how VR works. The setup screen was there, as if right in front of my eyes. But my vision said it's much farther. I could not read the texts at all. I put on my distance glasses, and it became a bit better. Most of it was still unreadable because the text was too small (remember my optic nerve problem). Anyway, it was a next-next-finish process, so I got through it. A caveat - Quest failed to scan the QR code for the WiFi setup because my phone screen was too bright. But I figured it out and everything worked when I turned the brightness down a bit.\n\u00a0\n\nStill, the setup experience would have been much easier if the texts were larger.\n\u00a0\n\nWhen Quest was set up, I finally could lean closer to the main menu, yay! Also, I set the text larger in the Accessibility settings. However, I wish there was an option to scale everything larger, including also the icons.\n\u00a0\n\nI found out unofficial information that Quest has a focal distance of about 1.3m. That explains why my experience differs so much from Cardboard. 1.3m is too far away out of my best vision zone, even when everything looks like it's right in front of my eyes, especially when I move closer to the main menu. I miss the lens distance adjustment so much...\n\u00a0\n\nThen I started to think about my prescription lens options for Quest to make things better. I don't want to return it.\n\u00a0\n\nMy distance prescription seemed too weak for Quest. So I took my old trial lens set and played around with it a bit. The results are strange. For example, -2 diopters are the best for me when looking at objects at a 1.5m distance in real life. My everyday distance specs are actually weaker (-1.5 diopters with +0.5 astigmatism correction). If I take a -3 lens, it's too much, it's blurry.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, in Quest, -3 diopters seem a good option. Even -4 diopters do not make things as bad as in real life! The difference between the lenses is not as noticeable as in real life. Also, switching trial lenses when using Quest is not easy. I have to be careful not to scratch the Quest lenses and still switch the trial lenses fast enough so that I can compare them. But I think I'll make things simple and stick to -2. I'll buy some cheap glasses with this value to use in VR for some time before buying the lens inserts.\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for reading this long story.

I figured with App Sharing, it would be easy for her to access all of the appropriately-aged experiences I've already purchased. Unfortunately, it isn't as easy as one might hope, but you can make it work and so I thought I would share what I've learnt for the benefit of this community.\n\n**The Prep**\n\nI set my 10 year-old up with a Supervised Child Account on the Quest 2. My account is the admin account on that device and I have confirmed that App Sharing is turned on. I have a copy of a number of games that she might like e.g. Fruit Ninja that are rated E for Everyone. They are purchased and downloaded into my main account and I can play them there. \n\n**The Problem**\n\nThe problem was that when we switched to my child's account and she went to play them, she was forced to send a permission request (even though the game does not have a rating conflict with her age), and when the permission request came to my Quest mobile app it seemed to indicate that we have to purchase the app again. **NOTE:** **This is not the reality**, but all the verbiage on the page indicates that she can't benefit from App Sharing. \n\nI will say that this seems to be the case of a couple of bugs\/process errors or use cases that haven't been fully considered in the current Quest app. \n\n**The Solution**\n\nFor the community's benefit, here's a step-by-step (with screenshots attached at the bottom) showing how I got App Sharing to work with a Supervised Child's Account :\n\n1. In the Child's account on the Quest headset, when searching for the app, your child will be forced to request permission for the app, even if it is rated E for Everyone.\n2. You will get an OS notification (iOS or Android) on your mobile Quest app saying that your child has requested access to this quest experience\/app. Tap on the OS notification or go to the notifications screen in the Meta Quest app (bell icon at the top of your feed) and tap on it from there.\n3. You will be brought to a screen with the name of the app. This screen also has the name of your child with a note underneath it saying \"Not allowed\" in yellow text and a button below that that says \"Review app\". The screen also gives you some stats about the app including the price and age rating. Tap on the \"Review app\" button.\n4. The next screen is titled \"Allow access to this app?\" and it tells you what info will be shared (e.g. username) and has a button to \"Allow and purchase\" as well as a \"Not now\" button. Tap the Allow and Purchase button (don't worry it doesn't charge you yet).\n5. You're now brought to a screen titled \"Complete this purchase for \\[child's name\\] in the Meta Quest Store\". At the bottom of that screen is a \"Go to Store\" button. I've found that you can X out of the process flow here or tap on the button. They both bring you to the same place.\n6. You're now brought back to the screen from Step 3 above but the note under your child's name has changed to \"Allowed to use this app\" in green text and the button has changed \"Block\". You must X out of this screen.\n7. When you X out of the previous screen you are now brought to a screen titled \"Buy Gift\" which seems to be a store screen that opened in the background asking you to purchase the app. It has a go-back navigation arrowhead at the top left of the screen and a \"Next\" button at the bottom. If you tap the back arrowhead, the purchase is cancelled and you're done.\n8. If you hit \"Next\" it brings you to a screen titled \"Confirm Purchase\" which is a payment method selection screen. Here again you can tap the arrowhead at the top left to go back or it has buttons at the bottom to \"Confirm\" or \"Cancel\" the purchase. I have found that if you cancel the purchase, it works just fine and your child still has access to the app.\n\nFrom my perspective, the bugs\/errors in process seem to be in two places:\n\n* Screen in Step 4: The messaging here is shockingly bad for a company that has some really talented UX designers. Having screens that use language like \"purchase\" when the system should be able to easily determine that no \"purchase\" is necessary is a problem and caused me to unnecessarily second guess what was going to happen. I know at least one or two of Meta's UX designers and they're really smart people so I can only imagine that the relevant UX designers weren't fully consulted on this process flow, or that this use case wasn't considered because I can't imagine they would have let this through knowingly.\n* Screens in Steps 5, 7 &amp; 8: Once the app has been approved for the child, if it is already within the parent's library and\/or app sharing is turned on for the device, then the system shouldn't be prompting the parent to buy\/gift the app to the child.\n\nFrankly speaking, with supervised children accounts, any app that the parent has purchased and approved for the child should just be available for them. These are 10-12 year-olds. Meta shouldn't be trying to monetize them yet. At that age, it would be better, from a long-term product strategy standpoint at least, to give them free access to all of the parent's app purchases in the effort to allow them to experience and hopefully learn to love\/see the value in VR\/AR\/XR. And it shouldn't even rely on app sharing on a single device. Let the parent purchase a separate device for them so that the Parent and Child can both be in VR simultaneously and maybe even play together with some of the Local Multiplayer\/AR with Shared Spatial Anchors experiences (e.g. BAM, Grokit, Puzzling Pieces, etc.). Right now you can only do app sharing on a single device, but many homes (mine included) now have two or more Quest devices. Some of those devices (especially the older Quest 2s) are assigned just for the kids. One should be able to set up app sharing on at least a few household devices the same way we can share an AppleTV+ subscription with up to 5 family members who can each watch simultaneously and watch any movies purchased by anyone else in the family group. This is an example of how it should work in a digital family group. Now, those are product strategy choices rather than technical limitations, of course, but they are the choices I would make if I were responsible for setting this product's strategy and if my goal was the the long-term growth of this business unit.\n\nOK, my opinions aside, here are the screenshots I promised (with personal information redacted\/blurred out, of course):\n\n**Step

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a Quest 3, I wanted to assign my Quest 2 for my step-daughter to use. I figured with App Sharing, it would be easy for her to access all of the appropriately-aged experiences I&amp;#39;ve already purchased. Unfortunately, it isn&amp;#39;t as easy as one might hope, but you can make it work and so I thought I would share what I&amp;#39;ve learnt for the benefit of this community.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prep&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set my 10 year-old up with a Supervised Child Account on the Quest 2. My account is the admin account on that device and I have confirmed that App Sharing is turned on. I have a copy of a number of games that she might like e.g. Fruit Ninja that are rated E for Everyone. They are purchased and downloaded into my main account and I can play them there. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was that when we switched to my child&amp;#39;s account and she went to play them, she was forced to send a permission request (even though the game does not have a rating conflict with her age), and when the permission request came to my Quest mobile app it seemed to indicate that we have to purchase the app again. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This is not the reality&lt;\/strong&gt;, but all the verbiage on the page indicates that she can&amp;#39;t benefit from App Sharing. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will say that this seems to be the case of a couple of bugs\/process errors or use cases that haven&amp;#39;t been fully considered in the current Quest app. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Solution&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the community&amp;#39;s benefit, here&amp;#39;s a step-by-step (with screenshots attached at the bottom) showing how I got App Sharing to work with a Supervised Child&amp;#39;s Account :&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the Child&amp;#39;s account on the Quest headset, when searching for the app, your child will be forced to request permission for the app, even if it is rated E for Everyone.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will get an OS notification (iOS or Android) on your mobile Quest app saying that your child has requested access to this quest experience\/app. Tap on the OS notification or go to the notifications screen in the Meta Quest app (bell icon at the top of your feed) and tap on it from there.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You will be brought to a screen with the name of the app. This screen also has the name of your child with a note underneath it saying &amp;quot;Not allowed&amp;quot; in yellow text and a button below that that says &amp;quot;Review app&amp;quot;. The screen also gives you some stats about the app including the price and age rating. Tap on the &amp;quot;Review app&amp;quot; button.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next screen is titled &amp;quot;Allow access to this app?&amp;quot; and it tells you what info will be shared (e.g. username) and has a button to &amp;quot;Allow and purchase&amp;quot; as well as a &amp;quot;Not now&amp;quot; button. Tap the Allow and Purchase button (don&amp;#39;t worry it doesn&amp;#39;t charge you yet).&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;re now brought to a screen titled &amp;quot;Complete this purchase for [child&amp;#39;s name] in the Meta Quest Store&amp;quot;. At the bottom of that screen is a &amp;quot;Go to Store&amp;quot; button. I&amp;#39;ve found that you can X out of the process flow here or tap on the button. They both bring you to the same place.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&amp;#39;re now brought back to the screen from Step 3 above but the note under your child&amp;#39;s name has changed to &amp;quot;Allowed to use this app&amp;quot; in green text and the button has changed &amp;quot;Block&amp;quot;. You must X out of this screen.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When you X out of the previous screen you are now brought to a screen titled &amp;quot;Buy Gift&amp;quot; which seems to be a store screen that opened in the background asking you to purchase the app. It has a go-back navigation arrowhead at the top left of the screen and a &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button at the bottom. If you tap the back arrowhead, the purchase is cancelled and you&amp;#39;re done.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you hit &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; it brings you to a screen titled &amp;quot;Confirm Purchase&amp;quot; which is a payment method selection screen. Here again you can tap the arrowhead at the top left to go back or it has buttons at the bottom to &amp;quot;Confirm&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Cancel&amp;quot; the purchase. I have found that if you cancel the purchase, it works just fine and your child still has access to the app.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From my perspective, the bugs\/errors in process seem to be in two places:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Screen in Step 4: The messaging here is shockingly bad for a company that has some really talented UX designers. Having screens that use language like &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; when the system should be able to easily determine that no &amp;quot;purchase&amp;quot; is necessary is a problem and caused me to unnecessarily second guess what was going to happen. I know at least one or two of Meta&amp;#39;s UX designers and they&amp;#39;re really smart people so I can only imagine that the relevant UX designers weren&amp;#39;t fully consulted on this process flow, or that this use case wasn&amp;#39;t considered because I can&amp;#39;t imagine they would have let this through knowingly.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Screens in Steps 5, 7 &amp;amp; 8: Once the app has been approved for the child, if it is already within the parent&amp;#39;s library and\/or app sharing is turned on for the device, then the system shouldn&amp;#39;t be prompting the parent to buy\/gift the app to the child.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frankly speaking, with supervised children accounts, any app that the parent has purchased and approved for the child should just be available for them. These are 10-12 year-olds. Meta shouldn&amp;#39;t be trying to monetize them yet. At that age, it would be better, from a long-term product strategy standpoint at least, to give them free access to all of the parent&amp;#39;s app purchases in the effort to allow them to experience and hopefully learn to love\/see the value in VR\/AR\/XR. And it shouldn&amp;#39;t even rely on app sharing on a single device. Let the parent purchase a separate device for them so that the Parent and Child can both be in VR simultaneously and maybe even play together with some of the Local Multiplayer\/AR with Shared Spatial Anchors experiences (e.g. BAM, Grokit, Puzzling Pieces, etc.). Right now you can only do app sharing on a single device, but many homes (mine included) now have two or more Quest devices. Some of those devices (especially the older Quest 2s) are assigned just for the kids. One should be able to set up app sharing on at least a few household devices the same way we can share an AppleTV+ subscription with up to 5 family members who can each watch simultaneously and watch any movies purchased by anyone else in the family group. This is an example of how it should work in a digital family group. Now, those are product strategy choices rather than technical limitations, of course, but they are the choices I would make if I were responsible for setting this product&amp;#39;s strategy and if my goal was the the long-term growth of this business unit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OK, my opinions aside, here are the screenshots I promised (with personal information redacted\/blurred out, of course):&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p9m0qz9q0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2accfd168fa95cd65bbbf371e903085757ad6cf0\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p9m0qz9q0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2accfd168fa95cd65bbbf371e903085757ad6cf0&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/51w57vlr0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=451fcecd914feb61969aa1c36b5c1cd4e0fc4edd\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/51w57vlr0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=451fcecd914feb61969aa1c36b5c1cd4e0fc4edd&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mclm85qs0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37a12153e833c17687427c593fb97bd94da35552\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mclm85qs0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=37a12153e833c17687427c593fb97bd94da35552&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k9iv9imt0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3770fbfb6619a83604ceefb55bc9d12881e76591\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/k9iv9imt0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3770fbfb6619a83604ceefb55bc9d12881e76591&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/00b5oqxu0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01651b857176e4b7ce0a82095e71523a32f12c03\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/00b5oqxu0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01651b857176e4b7ce0a82095e71523a32f12c03&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5b9glrsv0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=237de8f51f291d0931c0048f6459b315cba7be84\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5b9glrsv0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=237de8f51f291d0931c0048f6459b315cba7be84&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/360so3mw0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ddd488584fdef441e56e9a6bab8d9f0c35a55a2a\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/360so3mw0tzb1.png?width=1284&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ddd488584fdef441e56e9a6bab8d9f0c35a55a2a&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope this is helpful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"735e3b5c-ef5c-11e9-a9ba-0e67d6819046","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#646d73","id":"17t7ejx","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"aslamna","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17t7ejx\/psa_app_sharing_with_supervised_child_accounts_is\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17t7ejx\/psa_app_sharing_with_supervised_child_accounts_is\/","subreddit_subscribers":461403,"created_utc":1699746422.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"anyone here with a Quest 3 having issues with the Store and Horizon feed images not displaying?

People might lose jobs because of AI, but people with ID may gain jobs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have used the VR Video and Apps created by this group, to use as VR experiences for other groups with mental health &amp;amp; learning disabilities. There can be an exciting future in facilitating groups to learn and create apps to benefit their own communities, and for people without disabilities.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We would like to roll out more projects like this, to more groups with ID (Adult and Youth). We want to explore further how personalized AI, can help these groups in all aspects of their lives.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We showcased the 3 projects to family, friends and reps from Intreo, Learning Networks and Disability groups, at Breffni Family Resource Centre on 7th November 2023.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please DM for more info, if you want to setup similar projects, or if you want to assist\/sponsor in any way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking time to read :)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"e4918626-d2e7-11e9-806f-0e3099a1df84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","id":"17qqvoj","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"LoukeSkywatcher","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17qqvoj\/we_have_been_using_ai_to_allow_people_with\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17qqvoj\/we_have_been_using_ai_to_allow_people_with\/","subreddit_subscribers":460603,"created_utc":1699464862.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"Hi Everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are just some of my musings on headsets I have owned, I have been in to VR since the early OG Vive days with a 780TI overclocked to the hilt, I remember pre ordering and the reddit hype was off the scale for months and months, good times.

At some point I got a Reverb G2 after using one at a VR arcade and being really impressed with it, the comfort was so much better than the Pro 2 but still had sweet spot issues and the resolution wasn't as good.
