He loves exploring Google Earth VR on my setup but he doesn\u2019t do computers so I have been trying to find a simple alternative that would provide a similar experience. I\u2019ve tried Wander, Woorld and now EarthQuest. \n\nIf you\u2019ve not heard of it, EarthQuest is available in App Lab, and is written by a teenager solo developer. It costs USD $4.99 which is quite reasonable. As it\u2019s a solo young developer making use of the expensive usage based Google Maps APIs, 5.00 one time is not going to cut it, so the developer instead has you set up your own Google Maps API key. This is not something everyone will want to do, but it\u2019s an interesting workaround to the problem since the API has a free usage tier that should supposedly be enough for one person to use daily without running over into charge territory. \n\nNow to the app itself. There is a lot of good stuff in here once you jump through all the hoops to get the API key created and transferred to the app. But there is also a lot of room for improvement and I hope the developer keeps at it and keeps developing it. \n\nFirst the good:\n\nThe sense of flying is wonderful.

He loves exploring Google Earth VR on my setup but he doesn\u2019t do computers so I have been trying to find a simple alternative that would provide a similar experience. I\u2019ve tried Wander, Woorld and now EarthQuest. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019ve not heard of it, EarthQuest is available in App Lab, and is written by a teenager solo developer. It costs USD $4.99 which is quite reasonable. As it\u2019s a solo young developer making use of the expensive usage based Google Maps APIs, 5.00 one time is not going to cut it, so the developer instead has you set up your own Google Maps API key. This is not something everyone will want to do, but it\u2019s an interesting workaround to the problem since the API has a free usage tier that should supposedly be enough for one person to use daily without running over into charge territory. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now to the app itself. There is a lot of good stuff in here once you jump through all the hoops to get the API key created and transferred to the app. But there is also a lot of room for improvement and I hope the developer keeps at it and keeps developing it. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First the good:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sense of flying is wonderful.

Just dropping in to leave my review of the recently released, Globular Cluster CMQ3 comfort mod for the Quest 3.\n\nA little history first on my experience with Globular Cluster over the past year. I purchased the Quest Pro in March of 2023 and the comfort out of the box was a little off, with pressure building in the forehead area due to the small stock pad, and the weight of the HMD putting most of the pressure there. Shortly after, I ordered the Globular Cluster comfort mod, with no knowledge of the company, but was going off suggestions I had seen over at r\/QuestPro. The mod made a huge difference in comfort for me, and the Pro quickly became my most comfortable HMD to date (I\u2019ve owned 8 HMDs in the last 7 years). \n\nPrior to the Pro in March, I purchased the PSVR2 in February, and had a hard time keeping the sweet spot due to slippage, and couldn\u2019t play the thing for over an hour or so due to pain in the forehead, rear head pain due to the padding design, and after some time the HMD would find its way to rest on my nose. When GC announced their PSVR2 comfort mod a couple months later, I was ecstatic to say the least, due to my positive experience with the Pro mod. I received my preorder of the VR2 mod over the summer, and it became just as comfortable as the Pro, with no slippage and perfect sweet spot throughout a session with no adjustments. The GC kit is now the #1 recommended comfort mod over at r\/PSVR.\n\nThis brings us to the Quest 3 version of the mod. The mods between HMDs are very similar, including 3 forehead pads, 3 rear pads, and 2 top straps of different types. I won\u2019t go into too much detail on the types of pads, but I will include my own photos and an Amazon link at the conclusion of the review. The best part about the GC kit in my opinion is being able to mix and match pads for the best comfort. My preferred Quest 3 setup includes the gray fabric forehead pad, the weighted honeycomb rear pad which gives the headset a perfect weight balance, and the padded top strap. However, those that exercise on their Quest may prefer the pleather pads, or cooling gel pad for easier cleaning.\n\nOverall, I have been highly satisfied with my GC products and their customer service is top notch (Thomas is the man! Any upgrades made to any of the kits and he will gladly ship you the updated pieces at no charge upon email request). I used the Bobo M2 Pro on my Quest 2 for 3 years, and can confidently say the GC kit wins in terms of comfort, although in its current form there is no battery addon. The underside of the rear headband includes 2 notches to mount their  future battery dock, and a magnetic facial interface is also coming soon for easy swapping, as the mod can be used with or without the facial interface (Similar to QPro design, and can be seen in my photos).\n\nTL:DR I am a happy GC customer for life and will purchase their mod for all my future HMDs.\n\nPhotos: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JeMtGV2\n\nAmazon and Direct Links (These mods sell out fast and may not even be available currently)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CPP67CQZ?ref_=cm_sw_r_apin_dp_2K0W6Y6HJ32JBE0V9DBG&amp;peakEvent=5&amp;dealEvent=1&amp;language=en-US\n\nhttps:\/\/www.globular-cluster.com\/cmq3.html","author_fullname":"t2_15ylzw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"The #1 comfort mod for Quest Pro and PSVR2 is now available for Quest 3 - Globular Cluster CMQ3 Review","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18w6l5n","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1704142825.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone.

I did not particularly like it, but once I started treating it like a pool arcade game instead of a pool simulation, I had fun with it. That's how I felt about ForeVR Bowl, as well; it's a bowling video game, and in that sense it's fun, compared to a bowling simulation, which Premium Bowling does better. (Tangent: I think Premium Bowling is great, but I kind of hate the UI and getting all set up in a game. Now that ForeVR Bowl has MR, I find myself paying that a lot more, because I just set a lane up in my living room, turn on some music on YouTube, and have fun leveling up. Premium Bowl needs to update its UI, which is a bit cumbersome, and add MR to move forward, IMO. But back to pool...)\n\nAnyway, ForeVR Pool reminded me that there were a bunch of pool games to try out. I had tried some when I first got into VR with my Quest 2 almost two years ago, and wasn't impressed. I think at the time I liked Spark Ball Pool, but apparently it's shit now, not sure. I didn't revisit it this time around, because I wasn't that impressed with it at the time, it was just the first one I found that I could actually play (can't recall what other games I tried at the time.)\n\nWell, I had picked up MiRacle Pool when it came out because I really absolutely love MR with the Quest 3. It revitalized Eleven Table Tennis for me, which I had mostly stopped playing, but is back in my regular rotation with MR because I can avoid any accidents or injuries now, and, like I said earlier, ForeVR Bowl MR is super fun. And MiRacle Pool is really fun too! Unfortunately I don't have enough space to truly walk around the pool table, so I'm moving it around a lot in order to take my shots, and while the controls feel better as a pool simulation than ForeVR Pool did by a lot, it still wasn't hitting the mark 100% for me. Still, it's free, and it has lots of room to grow and turn into something amazing, so I'd definitely recommend checking it out.\n\nWhen I looked up more information about MiRacle Pool, I discovered it's by the same developer of Black Hole Pool. Apparently it uses pretty much the same physics and everything. I don't entirely see the point of making two pool games--why not just add an MR option to BHP?--but MiRacle Pool was good enough that it made me interested in checking BHP out for real. I think I checked it out once upon a time, as I already had it in my library, but some research told me it's been updated quite a lot over the past year or two. (Back when I picked up BHP, it was a free app, iirc, and when I booted it I was told I was on a free trial which would require an in-app purchase to unlock the full version. If that was the case back then, that's probably why I ignored it from consideration, since I don't like that pay format. It's a premium app now, although interestingly, since I already owned the free version, I was locked out of paying for it outright. In the end I bought the in-app upgrade.)\n\nJumping into a game of Black Hole Pool, the first thing I noticed was that while the tightness of the pool itself was equal, the game just plays far better than MiRacle Pool. Being able to move around the pool table in the virtual space was a lot easier for me given I don't have an actual pool table sized room to play VR in. I also much prefer the menu system in BHP to the floating MR menu in MiRacle Pool, which I struggle to use (they should add the ability to place a control board\/jukebox in MR somewhere, which is what ForeVR Bowl has in MR.)\n\nThe main place where BHP shines it that, once you're comfortable with the game, you can head to the pool hall, which is thus far the best social experience I've found on Quest. I'm one of those older people that doesn't understand VRChat (I've tried a handful of times, and find the whole experience tremendously awkward, plus the \"children\" problem in that, Horizon, and any free app) but sidling up to a pool table in a bar and shooting the shit with some people over a game? That was easy. It mostly seemed to trend towards adults, lots of conversation, with localized spatial audio. BHP also has some leveling up in it, which is something I like in a game, even if it's fairly trivial and only offers some simple cue\/ball\/felt unlocks. \n\nTo me, VR shines in that you can use it to do \"activities\" rather than just play video games. That's fun too, sure, and I like playing DoE every few nights, but *this* is the kind of stuff I could do every day. If you're the same type of VR user as me and you've been sticking to various forms of racket games, golfing games, and rhythm\/drumming games, check out MiRacle Pool while it's free and consider trying Black Hole Pool next.\n\nI have no affiliation with the company, just hoping to meet some more like-minded people in the pool hall. :)","author_fullname":"t2_1469tt","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"I was sleeping on Black Hole Pool, but...","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Game Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18tqg8k","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Game Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703865811.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This game has recently entered my regular rotation alongside Eleven, Walkabout, and my rhythm games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I recently picked up ForeVR Pool because it was on sale and I was curious to see how it played.

But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.","author_fullname":"t2_a7mpw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Towers and Powers Review: VR's newest tower defense game","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Content Creator) - Standalone"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18suptt","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Content Creator) - Standalone","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703772448.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM\"&gt;https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate it if you would give my video a watch, I give some pretty good examples in it to help give you an idea of what this game is like.

In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn&amp;#39;t even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It&amp;#39;s intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it&amp;#39;s best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it&amp;#39;s an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren&amp;#39;t wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it&amp;#39;s certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it&amp;#39;s just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn&amp;#39;t help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you&amp;#39;re looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3a0bd6a8095801405d5ed95ec208213cfb3518f3","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246118633e6653f0db20e00beb06223b9cc3906e","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0508d4bc30738f86601aee90ddf6332c8ef1296","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e6070b955d44fe81246bfebe72c5203d2e188e6","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"ufpSs57_l5cXn1luM5M6K0sTI67MB3qDxAF5TI26_6g"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"4d71f698-13af-11ed-b06d-c62004b4372a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"18suptt","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"bmack083","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18suptt\/towers_and_powers_review_vrs_newest_tower_defense\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18suptt\/towers_and_powers_review_vrs_newest_tower_defense\/","subreddit_subscribers":478101,"created_utc":1703772448.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"Everyone makes a list of the best.

Same goes for charging, sometimes I&amp;#39;ll be charging while playing and it will snap from 50% to 100% in a matter of minutes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The headset was purchased in December 2021 and the battery life has been extremely consistent until very recently. Should I try a factory reset? This is obviously some kind of software issue. Li-ion batteries don&amp;#39;t just go bad overnight like that.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"6647d3b2-13f1-11ed-ae31-a68c4c00080c","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"18s8w1y","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"PocketSizedRS","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18s8w1y\/quest_2_erratic_battery_behaviour_indicated\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18s8w1y\/quest_2_erratic_battery_behaviour_indicated\/","subreddit_subscribers":477461,"created_utc":1703705288.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"What type of battery pack do I need to add more juice to my quest 3?\nThanks in advance","author_fullname":"t2_skkfsqen","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Battery pack required for quest 3","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18s6p1h","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703699847.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What type of battery pack do I need to add more juice to my quest 3?\nThanks in advance&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"e4918626-d2e7-11e9-806f-0e3099a1df84","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","id":"18s6p1h","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Muted-Diet2907","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18s6p1h\/battery_pack_required_for_quest_3\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18s6p1h\/battery_pack_required_for_quest_3\/","subreddit_subscribers":477421,"created_utc":1703699847.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"I've been attempting to play non-VR PC games using various desktop solutions so I can play my desktop games on my headset using a bluetooth mouse and keyboard connected to the headset.  \n\n\nHere are my results from testing various desktop solutions:\n\n# Virtual Desktop: \n\nSo far best success - however in video games the results are inconsistent with most games unplayable.

hype for asgards wrath 2 has been enormous,  everyone seems to be talking about it right now, I will say off the bat this is a very good game but I do have some complaints I'd like to share as I see no one really mentioning them but first we will start with the positives, the graphics are very good and the art style itself is amazing, the mix of Greek, Norse and Egyptian mythology is awesome, most characters so far seem very well voice acted, the combat is fun,the companions are fun and very likable, I also like the variety in weapons armor and relics, overall I think this game is good, but let's things that aren't exactly bad but maybe miss leading to some, this game isn't open world, think of it more like dragon age, you have big hubs to explore, I stead of one giant seems less world (close enough to open world I suppose but I thought I should mention it) \nAnother misleading thing is this is NOT the skyrim of standalone vr, this is much more Zelda Breath of the wild Vr and that is the biggest difference, if you are expecting a living breathing world with emergent gameplay, factions and deep meaningful gameplay choices then I'm sorry to disappoint you but this is not it, and it's not even close to that, it might be comparable to skyrim in size but no where near in depth, so far all dialog options lead to the same conclusion, some dialog options being almost exactly the same worded almost exactly the same, in my opinion they should have just forgone the dialog options completely, because as of right now they are entirely meaningless, perhaps they hold more weight in the future but I'm atleast 8 hours into the main campaign I have my second companion and so far they are meaningless and I don't really see that changing, same goes for alliance there doesn't seem to be anything to gauge good or evil, there is the order and chaos meter which is fun and I'll talk more about that later but again as far as I'm into the story it seems to have no affect, it's more of a passive multi-player feature (you pick either chaos or order and you and other players online try to tip the balance in order to recieve rewards very fun and exciting idea) but no bearing on the real story (perhaps it will lead to different endings or something but that's about all I expect) I suppose you can say there is a very lite class system, as you find new playable characters they specialize in different classes, but nothing you build yourself (except for the basic skill tree assigned to each character) you can not pick races, classes, nothing like that, its a very big game and it's moderately deep (especially for vr) but do not go in expecting skyrim, think of this as Breath of the wild VR and I think the expectations will be perfect\n\nI'd like to end this review by saying I think this game is very good and it's very fun, I do think a lot of the promotion was a bit misleading, again do not go in expecting skyrim levels of depth here as there is no meaningful faction (meaningful in terms of story and outcome) the dialog options mine as well not even exist they are entirely unneeded, but at the end of the day it's very addicting there are plenty of side quests to do,some really nice locations, enemy variety is alright not too dull and when it feels dull they tend to introduce a new enemy type to combat, loot is awesome, getting a full kit, then imbuing your favorite sword with an elemental ord is always epic, so with everything being said this game is still great and if you want an open world type experience it's really only this and assassins creed nexus and even with my complaints this game is MILES ahead of nexus in almost every way, the combat in this game blows nexus just out of the water so if you were stuck between the two I most definitely say go with AW2 no doubt I give this one an 8\/10 \n\nWhat do you guys think? I got mine free with my Quest 3 so even with my complaints I still can't be mad for me it was a free game and it's a damn good one so far just as I've said I feel like if your expecting something on the same level as skyrim you will be sorely disappointed \n\nI feel like if this game took two big maps like the first two you encounter, stopped there, fleshed them out more added more meaningful story choices, deeper rpg mechanics, and made the areas themselves feel more alive, this game would be perfect and you could call it the skyrim of VR but as of now the saying as wide as an ocean but

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hype for asgards wrath 2 has been enormous,  everyone seems to be talking about it right now, I will say off the bat this is a very good game but I do have some complaints I&amp;#39;d like to share as I see no one really mentioning them but first we will start with the positives, the graphics are very good and the art style itself is amazing, the mix of Greek, Norse and Egyptian mythology is awesome, most characters so far seem very well voice acted, the combat is fun,the companions are fun and very likable, I also like the variety in weapons armor and relics, overall I think this game is good, but let&amp;#39;s things that aren&amp;#39;t exactly bad but maybe miss leading to some, this game isn&amp;#39;t open world, think of it more like dragon age, you have big hubs to explore, I stead of one giant seems less world (close enough to open world I suppose but I thought I should mention it) \nAnother misleading thing is this is NOT the skyrim of standalone vr, this is much more Zelda Breath of the wild Vr and that is the biggest difference, if you are expecting a living breathing world with emergent gameplay, factions and deep meaningful gameplay choices then I&amp;#39;m sorry to disappoint you but this is not it, and it&amp;#39;s not even close to that, it might be comparable to skyrim in size but no where near in depth, so far all dialog options lead to the same conclusion, some dialog options being almost exactly the same worded almost exactly the same, in my opinion they should have just forgone the dialog options completely, because as of right now they are entirely meaningless, perhaps they hold more weight in the future but I&amp;#39;m atleast 8 hours into the main campaign I have my second companion and so far they are meaningless and I don&amp;#39;t really see that changing, same goes for alliance there doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be anything to gauge good or evil, there is the order and chaos meter which is fun and I&amp;#39;ll talk more about that later but again as far as I&amp;#39;m into the story it seems to have no affect, it&amp;#39;s more of a passive multi-player feature (you pick either chaos or order and you and other players online try to tip the balance in order to recieve rewards very fun and exciting idea) but no bearing on the real story (perhaps it will lead to different endings or something but that&amp;#39;s about all I expect) I suppose you can say there is a very lite class system, as you find new playable characters they specialize in different classes, but nothing you build yourself (except for the basic skill tree assigned to each character) you can not pick races, classes, nothing like that, its a very big game and it&amp;#39;s moderately deep (especially for vr) but do not go in expecting skyrim, think of this as Breath of the wild VR and I think the expectations will be perfect&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to end this review by saying I think this game is very good and it&amp;#39;s very fun, I do think a lot of the promotion was a bit misleading, again do not go in expecting skyrim levels of depth here as there is no meaningful faction (meaningful in terms of story and outcome) the dialog options mine as well not even exist they are entirely unneeded, but at the end of the day it&amp;#39;s very addicting there are plenty of side quests to do,some really nice locations, enemy variety is alright not too dull and when it feels dull they tend to introduce a new enemy type to combat, loot is awesome, getting a full kit, then imbuing your favorite sword with an elemental ord is always epic, so with everything being said this game is still great and if you want an open world type experience it&amp;#39;s really only this and assassins creed nexus and even with my complaints this game is MILES ahead of nexus in almost every way, the combat in this game blows nexus just out of the water so if you were stuck between the two I most definitely say go with AW2 no doubt I give this one an 8\/10 &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What do you guys think? I got mine free with my Quest 3 so even with my complaints I still can&amp;#39;t be mad for me it was a free game and it&amp;#39;s a damn good one so far just as I&amp;#39;ve said I feel like if your expecting something on the same level as skyrim you will be sorely disappointed &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like if this game took two big maps like the first two you encounter, stopped there, fleshed them out more added more meaningful story choices, deeper rpg mechanics, and made the areas themselves feel more alive, this game would be perfect and you could call it the skyrim of VR but as of now the saying as wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle comes to mind&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"f66c41f2-0545-11ea-889b-0e9b804d5623","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","id":"18r8kz9","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Thesmileycoyote","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18r8kz9\/asgards_wrath_2_honest_review\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18r8kz9\/asgards_wrath_2_honest_review\/","subreddit_subscribers":476444,"created_utc":1703598797.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"","author_fullname":"t2_kry1x874","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Do you see potential in Mixed Reality?

was trying to show my parents the Quest 3. I sat on the couch and created a stationary boundary and pulled up a game. I gave the headset to my non-tech-savvy 70 year old mom with bad knees and hips, and it was prompting her to also make a boundary, and she couldn\u2019t figure it out. \n\nI couldn\u2019t do it for her bc I can\u2019t sit ON her to set it up.  So I had to have her get up, with pain, and hobble over to the place where I was sitting so that she can see the Quest. Then once she\u2019s done, she has to get back up to go back to her original seat. \n\nSo the only way that I can show other people the Quest is if they come and sit exactly where I was sitting. \n\nAnd even if they do that, the view is often all askew and not where I had it when I set it up. So I tell them to hold down the indented Meta button on the right controller, and they\u2019re pressing every button **except** that one. \n\nIf they have any issues where I need to jump in, I have to awkwardly put my head and face all in their personal space while I fix whatever issue they\u2019re having. \n\nThe whole process is just unbelievably frustrating. \n\nI know that there\u2019s developer mode, but it doesn\u2019t allow passthrough, and that\u2019s one of the things I wanted to show my family members.

I sat on the couch and created a stationary boundary and pulled up a game. I gave the headset to my non-tech-savvy 70 year old mom with bad knees and hips, and it was prompting her to also make a boundary, and she couldn\u2019t figure it out. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t do it for her bc I can\u2019t sit ON her to set it up.  So I had to have her get up, with pain, and hobble over to the place where I was sitting so that she can see the Quest.

Unfortunately, Meta Support just makes you uninstall\/reinstall everything which rarely fixes any problem, if at all.  There's one more thing that I was able to resolve which is connecting your headset via the Type C VirtualLink port on the back of RTX 2XXX series cards. There seems to be lack of support around this but I feel like its the best way to connect to your VR since since it provides\u00a0fast charging, a Type-C connector as well as USB 3 Gen 2 speeds. Most Type A USB 3.0 ports on motherboards don't provide enough power to keep your Quest 2 running for a long gaming session.  \n\n\n**Pre-Requisites:**  \n1. Make sure your developer mode is enabled and USB Debugging is on in the Quest app. There are a lot of tutorials available so I'll skip this step. Also, double check this because the recent Quest 2 software update randomly turned it off for me.  \n2. Have your GPU Drivers updated and a USB 3 Gen 1 or Gen 2 cable. If you're connecting via the VirtualLink port, it's super important that you have a USB 3.0 cable since USB 2.0 cables don't work with it.  \n3. Install or update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages, both x86 and x64 from [here](https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/cpp\/windows\/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170). This fixes most of the black screen or infinite three dots issues on Oculus Link.  \n4. Make sure you're not on the PTC channel in your Oculus Link Desktop App since it has issues with Quest Link. The option can be found in Settings -&gt; Beta.  \n\n\n**VirtualLink Fix (Skip this step if you don't have a RTX 2XXX Series Card):**  \nThere seems to be an issue with the current Nvidia drivers and VirtualLink, if you go to 'Device Manager' and look for 'Nvidia USB Type-C Port Policy Controller', it would show a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark on it. On driver version 546.29, there was an option 'Updates' in the menu bar of Nvidia Control Panel which has an option 'Update VirtualLink Firmware' but when you clicked on it, the update instantly went to 50% and gets stuck there forever. It shows your current version as 0.0.0 and available version as 3.1.8.   \nThe fix is to install Driver Booster Free version and it would show 'Nvidia USB Type-C Port Policy Controller' as faulty. Once you update it using Driver Booster, it will update the driver to 1.50.831.832 from 1.45.831.832. Restart your PC and the yellow triangle with an exclamation mark will be gone in Device Manager and you can verify that your port is now functional by connecting an Android phone to it using the Type C Link cable, your phone's storage should be accessible through it.  \n\n\n**Link Cable Fix:**  \nThe first step would be to get the 'Test Connection' option on Oculus Link to pass with your cable. I'm using a third party 5M USB 3 Gen 1 Cable and I can assure you that your cable is rarely the problem, most issues are software related.   \n\n\n**Installing ADB Drivers Manually:**\n\nThe steps I followed to get the 'Test Connection' option to pass with my cable:  \n1. Download and extract Quest ADB Drivers from here: [Driver Link](https:\/\/developer.oculus.com\/downloads\/package\/oculus-adb-drivers\/)  \n2. Go to Device Manager and click on your PC's name at the top.  \n3. Click on 'Action' in the menu bar and click on 'Add Legacy Hardware'.  \n4. Select the option \"Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)\" .  \n5. Next, make sure \"Show All Devices\" is highlighted and then select \"Have Disk...\" button.  \n6. Then select \"Browse...\" and provide the path to the \"android\\_winusb.inf\" file that you extracted in Step 1.  \n7. It would show you three options next, 'Oculus ADB Interface', 'Oculus Bootloader Interface' and 'Oculus Composite ADB Interface'. You need to install them one by one and repeat Steps 2-6 for each of these options.  \n8. One they are installed, connect your Quest 2 with your cable. Your Device Manager would now have a new entry 'Oculus Device' under which you'll see yellow triangles with exclamation marks for each of these options: 'Oculus ADB Interface', 'Oculus Bootloader Interface' and 'Oculus Composite ADB Interface'.  \n\n\n**Random Steps You Have To Follow To Get It All Working:**\n\n1. Now if you run Oculus Link and test the cable, it doesn't work. You could get an error\u00a0message like 'Oculus Quest 2 Link Cable connection test was not able to start (1971063)'.  \n2. You need to restart your PC at this point. Connect your Quest 2 to your PC using the cable and make sure you follow the next step correctly, otherwise it won't work.  \n3. Keep your Quest 2 plugged in via the cable and turn it off. Make sure you turn it off, **do not restart it.** Leave it off for a few seconds and then turn it on again.  \n4. Now in your Device Manager under 'Oculus Device', you'll see two new entries 'Oculus Composite ADB Interface' and 'Oculus Composite XRSP Interface'. But this time, they won't have those yellow triangles with exclamation marks which means your Quest is now successfully detected.  \n5. Now this is strange but in order for you to allow USB Debugging you'll have to install SideQuest. I've seen a lot of people having an issue where the 'Allow USB Debugging' menu doesn't show up on their Quest 2 after a software update once they connect to the Oculus Link Desktop App.  \n6. Now if you open SideQuest, a USB connection dialog pops up in your Quest that asks you to allow the USB connection using a fingerprint ID. If you can access your Quest's storage on SideQuest, everything was setup correctly.  \n7. Once you allow it, run the 'Test Connection' on Oculus Link, the test should pass and show your cable's bandwidth.  \n8. Go to 'Quick Settings' on your Quest and then select 'Quest Link' and disable AirLink using the AirLink toggle button.  \n9. Your PC should show up as 'Rift' or similar, click on Launch and everything should work perfectly fine now!  \n\n\n**Problems:**\n\nYou have to connect and turn your Quest on and off everytime for your PC to recognize your device. This seems to be the only annoying issue that remains and hopefully Meta fixes it in their future updates. In case you guys run into any other problems, feel free to comment below. I'll try my best to resolve them for you.","author_fullname":"t2_9suzssh6","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"High-Success Fix for people having issues connecting to Oculus Link via Cable or AirLink (Bonus: Nvidia VirtualLink Fix)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Support - PCVR"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18osbx8","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Support - PCVR","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703288784.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, hope you guys are doing well.&lt;br\/&gt;\nI have been trying to get my third party Link cable to work with Oculus Link for the past couple of days and I think I&amp;#39;ve finally found a solution that should help most of you out.

Most Type A USB 3.0 ports on motherboards don&amp;#39;t provide enough power to keep your Quest 2 running for a long gaming session.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-Requisites:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;\n1. Make sure your developer mode is enabled and USB Debugging is on in the Quest app. There are a lot of tutorials available so I&amp;#39;ll skip this step. Also, double check this because the recent Quest 2 software update randomly turned it off for me.&lt;br\/&gt;\n2. Have your GPU Drivers updated and a USB 3 Gen 1 or Gen 2 cable. If you&amp;#39;re connecting via the VirtualLink port, it&amp;#39;s super important that you have a USB 3.0 cable since USB 2.0 cables don&amp;#39;t work with it.&lt;br\/&gt;\n3. Install or update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages, both x86 and x64 from &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/learn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/cpp\/windows\/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;. This fixes most of the black screen or infinite three dots issues on Oculus Link.&lt;br\/&gt;\n4. Make sure you&amp;#39;re not on the PTC channel in your Oculus Link Desktop App since it has issues with Quest Link. The option can be found in Settings -&amp;gt; Beta.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VirtualLink Fix (Skip this step if you don&amp;#39;t have a RTX 2XXX Series Card):&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;\nThere seems to be an issue with the current Nvidia drivers and VirtualLink, if you go to &amp;#39;Device Manager&amp;#39; and look for &amp;#39;Nvidia USB Type-C Port Policy Controller&amp;#39;, it would show a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark on it. On driver version 546.29, there was an option &amp;#39;Updates&amp;#39; in the menu bar of Nvidia Control Panel which has an option &amp;#39;Update VirtualLink Firmware&amp;#39; but when you clicked on it, the update instantly went to 50% and gets stuck there forever. It shows your current version as 0.0.0 and available version as 3.1.8.&lt;br\/&gt;\nThe fix is to install Driver Booster Free version and it would show &amp;#39;Nvidia USB Type-C Port Policy Controller&amp;#39; as faulty. Once you update it using Driver Booster, it will update the driver to 1.50.831.832 from 1.45.831.832. Restart your PC and the yellow triangle with an exclamation mark will be gone in Device Manager and you can verify that your port is now functional by connecting an Android phone to it using the Type C Link cable, your phone&amp;#39;s storage should be accessible through it.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link Cable Fix:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;\nThe first step would be to get the &amp;#39;Test Connection&amp;#39; option on Oculus Link to pass with your cable. I&amp;#39;m using a third party 5M USB 3 Gen 1 Cable and I can assure you that your cable is rarely the problem, most issues are software related.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing ADB Drivers Manually:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The steps I followed to get the &amp;#39;Test Connection&amp;#39; option to pass with my cable:&lt;br\/&gt;\n1. Download and extract Quest ADB Drivers from here: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/developer.oculus.com\/downloads\/package\/oculus-adb-drivers\/\"&gt;Driver Link&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;\n2. Go to Device Manager and click on your PC&amp;#39;s name at the top.&lt;br\/&gt;\n3. Click on &amp;#39;Action&amp;#39; in the menu bar and click on &amp;#39;Add Legacy Hardware&amp;#39;.&lt;br\/&gt;\n4. Select the option &amp;quot;Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)&amp;quot; .&lt;br\/&gt;\n5. Next, make sure &amp;quot;Show All Devices&amp;quot; is highlighted and then select &amp;quot;Have Disk...&amp;quot; button.&lt;br\/&gt;\n6. Then select &amp;quot;Browse...&amp;quot; and provide the path to the &amp;quot;android_winusb.inf&amp;quot; file that you extracted in Step 1.&lt;br\/&gt;\n7. It would show you three options next, &amp;#39;Oculus ADB Interface&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Oculus Bootloader Interface&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Oculus Composite ADB Interface&amp;#39;. You need to install them one by one and repeat Steps 2-6 for each of these options.&lt;br\/&gt;\n8. One they are installed, connect your Quest 2 with your cable. Your Device Manager would now have a new entry &amp;#39;Oculus Device&amp;#39; under which you&amp;#39;ll see yellow triangles with exclamation marks for each of these options: &amp;#39;Oculus ADB Interface&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Oculus Bootloader Interface&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Oculus Composite ADB Interface&amp;#39;.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random Steps You Have To Follow To Get It All Working:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now if you run Oculus Link and test the cable, it doesn&amp;#39;t work. You could get an error\u00a0message like &amp;#39;Oculus Quest 2 Link Cable connection test was not able to start (1971063)&amp;#39;.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You need to restart your PC at this point. Connect your Quest 2 to your PC using the cable and make sure you follow the next step correctly, otherwise it won&amp;#39;t work.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep your Quest 2 plugged in via the cable and turn it off. Make sure you turn it off, &lt;strong&gt;do not restart it.&lt;\/strong&gt; Leave it off for a few seconds and then turn it on again.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now in your Device Manager under &amp;#39;Oculus Device&amp;#39;, you&amp;#39;ll see two new entries &amp;#39;Oculus Composite ADB Interface&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Oculus Composite XRSP Interface&amp;#39;. But this time, they won&amp;#39;t have those yellow triangles with exclamation marks which means your Quest is now successfully detected.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now this is strange but in order for you to allow USB Debugging you&amp;#39;ll have to install SideQuest. I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of people having an issue where the &amp;#39;Allow USB Debugging&amp;#39; menu doesn&amp;#39;t show up on their Quest 2 after a software update once they connect to the Oculus Link Desktop App.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now if you open SideQuest, a USB connection dialog pops up in your Quest that asks you to allow the USB connection using a fingerprint ID. If you can access your Quest&amp;#39;s storage on SideQuest, everything was setup correctly.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once you allow it, run the &amp;#39;Test Connection&amp;#39; on Oculus Link, the test should pass and show your cable&amp;#39;s bandwidth.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &amp;#39;Quick Settings&amp;#39; on your Quest and then select &amp;#39;Quest Link&amp;#39; and disable AirLink using the AirLink toggle button.&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your PC should show up as &amp;#39;Rift&amp;#39; or similar, click on Launch and everything should work perfectly fine now!&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problems:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have to connect and turn your Quest on and off everytime for your PC to recognize your device. This seems to be the only annoying issue that remains and hopefully Meta fixes it in their future updates. In case you guys run into any other problems, feel free to comment below. I&amp;#39;ll try my best to resolve them for you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=41fa146938cd97da5abfeff0d092a2cc151e65fa","width":1200,"height":630},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3881e36da92b82c6947f6ca4ff3804ca47f2aea","width":108,"height":56},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17b5b01e50a969ac9e2353bebb062cd52a99d108","width":216,"height":113},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=acadaf004e8aeb6919eabdb0d93065a34f7e89df","width":320,"height":168},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=883009d39175a2f03b76275ed0f7c6011d94a3a7","width":640,"height":336},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7cc62aef83f192d102fa78c83c8f4fcfa85057e3","width":960,"height":504},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/CcTKId6ti1J-bMqj-jlWVD1tyE1LbM9FagmfDfaIVmQ.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ca6913f202be9a9f83b266dd459edc90adbf9dd","width":1080,"height":567}],"variants":{},"id":"RCFh0Kid3SAqWEkALMGNW1e9Vu6ayZpftekoayP00hY"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"61ef9df4-13f1-11ed-b0a2-ae8a4a841be6","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"18osbx8","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"IIShadyII","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18osbx8\/highsuccess_fix_for_people_having_issues\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/18osbx8\/highsuccess_fix_for_people_having_issues\/","subreddit_subscribers":474495,"created_utc":1703288784.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"Hello all,\n\nI'm loving this game but about 8 hours in I decided I might want to try the female voice because the male voice isn't really m cup of tea.

Feet should be shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and body weight evenly distributed.\n\n1. **Grip:**  \n\n\n* Hold the sword with both hands, maintaining a firm but not overly tense grip. The dominant hand usually holds the hilt closer to the guard, while the non-dominant hand is placed on the lower part of the hilt.\n\n1. **Initiation of Movement:**  \n\n\n* The movement starts from the legs and hips. Rotate your hips in the direction you want to swing the sword. This rotation generates power and initiates the kinetic chain.\n\n1. **Transfer of Energy to Torso:**  \n\n\n* As you rotate your hips, the energy is transferred to your torso. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability and control throughout the movement.\n\n1. **Shoulder Rotation:**  \n\n\n* The rotation of the hips is followed by the rotation of the shoulders. This sequential movement adds to the power generated by the hips. Keep the non-dominant shoulder pointed toward the target.\n\n1. **Arm Extension:**  \n\n\n* Once the energy reaches the shoulders, extend your arms to bring the sword toward the target. This extension of the arms is a result of the coordinated movement of the hips and shoulders.\n\n1. **Wrist Action:**  \n\n\n* Utilize your wrists to control the orientation of the sword. Depending on the type of sword and the specific technique, there might be variations in how the wrists are used. For example, in some techniques, the wrists might snap at the end of the swing for a more precise cut.\n\n1. **Follow-Through:**  \n\n\n* Allow your body to follow through with the swing. This means that after making contact with the target or completing the intended motion, your body continues its movement in the same direction.

Rotate your hips in the direction you want to swing the sword. This rotation generates power and initiates the kinetic chain.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transfer of Energy to Torso:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As you rotate your hips, the energy is transferred to your torso. Engage your core muscles to maintain stability and control throughout the movement.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder Rotation:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The rotation of the hips is followed by the rotation of the shoulders. This sequential movement adds to the power generated by the hips. Keep the non-dominant shoulder pointed toward the target.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arm Extension:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Once the energy reaches the shoulders, extend your arms to bring the sword toward the target. This extension of the arms is a result of the coordinated movement of the hips and shoulders.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrist Action:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Utilize your wrists to control the orientation of the sword. Depending on the type of sword and the specific technique, there might be variations in how the wrists are used. For example, in some techniques, the wrists might snap at the end of the swing for a more precise cut.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow-Through:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;br\/&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow your body to follow through with the swing. This means that after making contact with the target or completing the intended motion, your body continues its movement in the same direction.

It is immersion breaking at best and nausea inducing at worst depending on what the player is trying to do.  \n\n\n**The incredibly Easy Solution you should have implemented when you started work on your Player Character:**  \n\n\nI'm demonstrating this in Unreal Engine BP so anyone can understand what's going on even if they don't understand code, but this simple concept translates even easier to C++, and would be incredibly easy to implement in other engines like Unity or Godot.   \n\n\nI think all players need to know how incredible simple this is because I have seen developers explain this away w\/ the \"Development Hard, You No Understand\" copout in the past, which again baffles me because dude.... Core Player Movement Feature... \\~1\/2 your player base...\n\n**Step 1:** Create an Enumerator for the types of movement you want the player to be able to select (You could totally pull this off with a Bool if you only have two movement types but using an Enum allows for more options now or down the road)  \n\n\n**Step 2:** Allow the player to set the \"Movement Direction\" Enum in your options menu. (Probably better to store this in Player Controller or Game Instance but for sake of simplicity it is stored directly in the Player BP in this example)\n\n**Step 3:** Have your movement events for smooth locomotion branch off based on The \"Movement Direction\" Enum.  \n\n\n[Simple Smooth Movement Setup](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xhhjl7402s6c1.png?width=2171&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b8068e079905d569e40a36ed55adde418f32aa0)\n\n**Step 4:** Instead of getting the World Rotation of the HMD like you would for Head Steering, get the World Rotation of the Left Motion Controller. Ignore the X and Y Rotations as this will have an effect on the player's speed, these should always be 0. Get the Forward Vector from your Rotation (0,0,Z) and that is your world direction. Do the exact same for your MoveRight event but get the Right Vector instead. And ya Don.

(Probably better to store this in Player Controller or Game Instance but for sake of simplicity it is stored directly in the Player BP in this example)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;\/strong&gt; Have your movement events for smooth locomotion branch off based on The &amp;quot;Movement Direction&amp;quot; Enum.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xhhjl7402s6c1.png?width=2171&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2b8068e079905d569e40a36ed55adde418f32aa0\"&gt;Simple Smooth Movement Setup&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;\/strong&gt; Instead of getting the World Rotation of the HMD like you would for Head Steering, get the World Rotation of the Left Motion Controller. Ignore the X and Y Rotations as this will have an effect on the player&amp;#39;s speed, these should always be 0. Get the Forward Vector from your Rotation (0,0,Z) and that is your world direction. Do the exact same for your MoveRight event but get the Right Vector instead. And ya Don.

Most of all, I was worried I\u2019d use it for a few days and then have buyers remorse\u2026 wishing I\u2019d not given in to temptation and lambasting myself for having expectations that were way too high. \n\nI\u2019m glad to report that I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised with how refined and polished the device and system experience has been\u2026 way more so than I expected from Meta. Privacy and data slurping was a big concern but I think the use of a Meta account vs. Facebook one helps separate concerns and there are a lot of options for controlling how much data is processed and retained in Meta\u2019s data centers. It could be better but not as terrible as I first suspected.\n\nThe mixed reality and virtual reality experience is actually very well executed\u2026 Yes, there could be more MR features at launch but it works and a set of additional features are scheduled to roll out over the next few months which I\u2019m now eagerly awaiting. It\u2019s the combination of the buttery-smooth tracking, graphics, lenses, high frame rate and some impressive third-party apps that helps the Quest 3 deliver moments that have had me open mouthed and being awestruck a good number of times over the last few weeks. \n\nDo I recommend it? Yes. Will I continue to use it? Yes. Does it feel like \u201ca whole new world of entertainment and experience\u201d? Yes. Does it give you eye-strain? A little. Is the pass-through totally high-res and like walking around without a headset? No.\n\nLast thing on the device: The battery lasts about 2 hours which I\u2019ve found about right \/ acceptable most days - I tend to want a rest by then. This is especially true when you\u2019re stood up playing (I\u2019m probably just being lazy). It would be nice if it recharged faster than it does but it\u2019s rarely been an issue. As the device ages, if the battery life reduces substantially, that could well become an issue.\n\nSoftware I\u2019ve been using and ratings:\n\nRed Matter 2: 4\/5\n\nLove this for the graphics, the experience and the jaw-dropping moments looking out over Jupiter and her rings, etc. Picking up a picture, turning it in your hand and seeing the smudges and dust on the glass close up is a testament to the attention to detail and makes some moments in the game stand out for me.

The hand tracking mode works really well and makes me feel like a God\u2026 standing on the island, looking down and orchestrating zoning and construction from up on high! The ability to zoom in and then sit on the floor in amongst your city and its citizens is brilliant. And the little planes, hot air balloons and birds that fly past your head adds to the magic. Not something I\u2019d play for a whole VR session but I do find myself dipping in to my islands on a regular basis to extend them and refine them. I\u2019d recommend this solely on the experience but the game is good in its own right. It would be nice, however, to see more more challenges along the way.

What I like about Supernatural is the slickness of the experience, the real music (not covers) and the way boxing and flow workouts are well orchestrated to the music. It makes you feel like you\u2019re boxing or flowing in a kind of dance mode which is motivating and good fun. Tips: buy a silicone interface cover because you WILL sweat a lot with these workouts. Also, wear the straps\u2026 this title is energetic and fast and I\u2019ve almost let go of a controller a few times. Make sure you have space as the app asks you to turn left and right to face a number of \u201cportals\u201d in each music track. Think of it as beat saber for exercise. It\u2019s subscription based but I think worthy of a monthly fee\u2026 I\u2019m using the monthly vs. annual fee so I can gauge longevity\/commitment first. If I stop using it within a few months, I\u2019ll update this review.  \n\nBeat Saber:\n\nA VR oldie but a great example of what VR gaming is all about\u2026 a new type of experience that is hard to replicate outside of VR.

I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised how engaging this is\u2026 sitting at a table with a little Lego diorama on it and controlling a little Lego man around it is very cool\u2026 especially in MR mode. I had my doubts about the Lego construction element but this is surprisingly good. You get to build things for the dioramas but with some challenges like a limited set of bricks, restricted size and a requirement it will hold the weight required for the task at hand\u2026 like a robot crossing a bridge.

Go get it and &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/ocul.us\/41spH0y\"&gt;get 25% off with this affiliate link&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lego Bricktales: 4\/5 so far&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New to my library a week or so ago. I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised how engaging this is\u2026 sitting at a table with a little Lego diorama on it and controlling a little Lego man around it is very cool\u2026 especially in MR mode. I had my doubts about the Lego construction element but this is surprisingly good. You get to build things for the dioramas but with some challenges like a limited set of bricks, restricted size and a requirement it will hold the weight required for the task at hand\u2026 like a robot crossing a bridge. Too early for me to say it\u2019s a winner but looking good so far.

but i dont know i feel like i could make a mistake by selling it, but i just want a simple plug and play headset, i spent too much time trying to set everything up, but it&amp;#39;s annoying since i really like watching videos in 360\u00b0 in new york and i paid 300 bucks, also i jusy bought virtual desktop as my last hope but idk it still isnt good quality, i just played the forest vr with a friend and it was a cool experience but really set me back because of the blurry and pixelated graphics, so any idea or i should just give up my quest 2 ?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps : specs : \n-rtx 3080\n-ryzen 7 5800x\n-32 go ram ddr4 3200mhz\n-wifi 5ghz&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Btw i tried cable link and air link before trying virtual desktop and it still doesnt change the quality&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ps english isnt my first language so sorry if i made mistakes while typing&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

Originally came from PC VR and I'm a fan of the Halo style head strap especially with the turning up at the back which makes it easy to tighten and also to take off the whole set.\n\nWhat's the default quest 3 strap it's always a hot mess - needing both hands taking it off and putting it on.\n\nThe facial interface arrived first. It is night and day compared to the default. The default one was made for a teenage kid. This one fits 2 a normal face with no pressure anywhere. Using the default strap this was a comfortable setup although the problem was still taking it on and off. Also there is no way to lift the headset temporarily while you look around you or type something on the computer.\n\nThe Bobo VR M3 Pro came next. It looks impressive and is a beast to install. The little Velcro tab is very hard to get in. It was also too short and offset on my to one side.\n\nI eventually got it in by sliding a piece of paper through the hook the other way and then using that to pull the Velcro tab through. I could immediately see a problem with the AMVR Facial Interface. Basically the M3 is more forward than the interface therefore the pressure is on the in the face and not on the forehead as designed. The bottom of the M3 also pressed on the top of the AMVR which created a pressure spot that didn't exist before.\n\nI also found the forehead phone on the M3 had a little fold by the way it was packed, meaning the false leather had a little kink that dug into my forehead. Hopefully it will return to normal shape in time.\n\nFirstly I tried without the facial interface like the other thread. I don't like it as the lenses do not stay with your eyes. It feels like a lag when you move your head around. But the fov was a lot better.\n\nThen I tried adjusting the facial interface and the different parts of the M3. By taking the Velcro off I could get the M3 closer to my head than the facial interface. This means the pressure is on my forehead as designed. The face was comfortable however it was now too far away and field of view is smaller.\n\nFor completeness I put the quest 3 original facial interface back on. I found it actually does not help with the spacing even though it is a few MM narrower than the AMVR. \n\nAfter a lot of adjustment I could finally get the best case of using these together which is having the AMVR and M3 on the same plan and touching my face with the same pressure.\n\nI think this is probably the best and only way to use Bobo VR M3 Pro with AMVR Facial Interface together.\n\nI use this for a few sessions and I think the balance of the pressure on the front and back are fine. The ease of taking it off and putting it back on is much better than default although it is only the same as what I got in PC VR before anyway.\n\nThe battery on the M3 has an electrical hum others have reported and it is quite distracting. The extra weight itself was not too bad although I don't play for a long time anyway.\n\nMy main problem was the two top padding, that somehow press into your head. It feels like an itch after a few minutes, then like someone resting their fingernails on your head.\n\nI don't know why M3 has this unlike every other strap that has a full pad going across. Is it a deal breaker? There are other good looking straps but have no battery.\n\nThe AMVR Facial Interface is def a keeper, but I'm not sure about the M3.","author_fullname":"t2_6zxlgo8x","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Bobo VR M3 Pro with AMVR Facial Interface Review","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18ggaqi","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1702365345.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well these are the most popular accessories for the quest 3 and I got them right away because the default facial interface and strap for the quest are terrible.

Essentially ones that will allow me to use my quest 3 as a virtual studio space to play my guitar and record vocals etc and collaborate with others on making songs and jamming. Ideally using MR, I'd also love features in a production studio that can enhance audio for track instruments (like clean up background noise, add reverb etc) and also for vocals (like reverb, echo levels, all that stuff). Extra bonus features would be being able to add virtually played instruments to build the songs up. Drums, synths, keyboard, bass etc. \n\nCurrently I am basically using the q3 to record video and have my phone open for my lyrics, I play my guitar and send my friends clips on WhatsApp within quest to get feedback and suggestions. It's quite good being able to do that but the audio is poor and having to use my phone simultaneously for lyrics isn't ideal.

Essentially ones that will allow me to use my quest 3 as a virtual studio space to play my guitar and record vocals etc and collaborate with others on making songs and jamming. Ideally using MR, I&amp;#39;d also love features in a production studio that can enhance audio for track instruments (like clean up background noise, add reverb etc) and also for vocals (like reverb, echo levels, all that stuff). Extra bonus features would be being able to add virtually played instruments to build the songs up. Drums, synths, keyboard, bass etc. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently I am basically using the q3 to record video and have my phone open for my lyrics, I play my guitar and send my friends clips on WhatsApp within quest to get feedback and suggestions. It&amp;#39;s quite good being able to do that but the audio is poor and having to use my phone simultaneously for lyrics isn&amp;#39;t ideal.
