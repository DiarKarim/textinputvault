He loves exploring Google Earth VR on my setup but he doesn\u2019t do computers so I have been trying to find a simple alternative that would provide a similar experience. I\u2019ve tried Wander, Woorld and now EarthQuest. \n\nIf you\u2019ve not heard of it, EarthQuest is available in App Lab, and is written by a teenager solo developer. It costs USD $4.99 which is quite reasonable. As it\u2019s a solo young developer making use of the expensive usage based Google Maps APIs, 5.00 one time is not going to cut it, so the developer instead has you set up your own Google Maps API key. This is not something everyone will want to do, but it\u2019s an interesting workaround to the problem since the API has a free usage tier that should supposedly be enough for one person to use daily without running over into charge territory. \n\nNow to the app itself.

Love the idea- hope it\u2019s executed well. \n\nNow for the bad:\n\nThe UI is quite awkward. You use your controllers like they are your fingertips so typing means poking at a keyboard with your controllers. And the keyboard for me often did not show up or did very far away from my position. It\u2019s a custom made keyboard that isn\u2019t very polished and I hope he can find a way to just use the standard keyboard and UI widgets and pointer or hand tracking or something.  Overall the UI could use some polish to bring it up to the level of the rest of the app. \n\nI appreciate the ability to use my own API key but I also think it will limit the success of the app. I think a subscription would be better suited to an app like this at least as an option. \n\nI never saw an option for seeing street view despite turning on that API. Not sure where that is - maybe I just missed something. \n\nThe search option was hit or miss for me. As I mentioned, sometimes the keyboard didn\u2019t show or was out of reach and sometimes when I searched for things nothing really happened. I restarted the app once and the search started working again.  \n\nI really wish there were some street names overlaid when looking down or even the city names. It was hard to figure out where I was unless there were some obvious landmarks. \n \nFinally this one is likely a limitation of the Google Earth tiles but down on the ground level the 3d tiles don\u2019t render at the quality that Google Earth VR does. I doubt this is something the developer did wrong and probably more Google crippling the service so theirs is better. But it is disappointing nonetheless when you fly in from above and zoom through streets that have a bit of a low polygon look. Feels almost like the outer parts in the movie Inception!  I remember being disappointed when trying Google earth at the detail when down low but this is actually a notch below.

I don't know where to begin, we've got lots of goodies in this one. Probably the most important one is that many Rift store games will now work again with Virtual Desktop. Meta recently changed their Unity\/Unreal SDK and it was hardcoded to only work against Link\/AirLink. So in today's update, we have a workaround to make them work again either through SteamVR's OpenXR runtime or through a new VirtualDesktopXR runtime, more on that below.\n\nMatthieu Bucchia, known for his work on OpenXR Toolkit, developed an open-source runtime called VirtualDesktopXR (VDXR) which allows you to play OpenXR games without SteamVR. In this update, we've bundled the runtime into Virtual Desktop and made it super easy to use. More information about VDXR can be found [here](https:\/\/github.com\/mbucchia\/VirtualDesktop-OpenXR\/wiki). In a nutshell, it is a highly optimized runtime which bypasses SteamVR and can improve the performance of OpenXR games. There's a new OpenXR runtime drop-down in the Streamer window with 3 choices: Automatic (default), SteamVR and VDXR. On Automatic, it will keep using SteamVR for the majority of games and will use VDXR for: MS Flight Simulator, DCS and Vail. When you select SteamVR or VDXR, it will use the selected runtime for all OpenXR games. Big thanks to \/u\/mbucchia for developing this amazing runtime!\n\nWe also have a bunch of Quest 3 specific improvements in this update: the maximum desktop streaming resolution was increased from 2560x1440 to 3840x2160 and the optimal resolution was bumped from 1920x1080 to 2560x1440. We've also improved clarity at the edges of the FOV when streaming VR games and increased the H.264+ maximum bitrate to 500 Mbps.

I don&amp;#39;t know where to begin, we&amp;#39;ve got lots of goodies in this one. Probably the most important one is that many Rift store games will now work again with Virtual Desktop. Meta recently changed their Unity\/Unreal SDK and it was hardcoded to only work against Link\/AirLink. So in today&amp;#39;s update, we have a workaround to make them work again either through SteamVR&amp;#39;s OpenXR runtime or through a new VirtualDesktopXR runtime, more on that below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matthieu Bucchia, known for his work on OpenXR Toolkit, developed an open-source runtime called VirtualDesktopXR (VDXR) which allows you to play OpenXR games without SteamVR. In this update, we&amp;#39;ve bundled the runtime into Virtual Desktop and made it super easy to use. More information about VDXR can be found &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mbucchia\/VirtualDesktop-OpenXR\/wiki\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;. In a nutshell, it is a highly optimized runtime which bypasses SteamVR and can improve the performance of OpenXR games. There&amp;#39;s a new OpenXR runtime drop-down in the Streamer window with 3 choices: Automatic (default), SteamVR and VDXR. On Automatic, it will keep using SteamVR for the majority of games and will use VDXR for: MS Flight Simulator, DCS and Vail. When you select SteamVR or VDXR, it will use the selected runtime for all OpenXR games.

If your television doesn't support this, you can, for example, buy a Chromecast stick that you plug into your television.\n\n**Tip 2: Set Quest 3 to factory settings**\n\nIf your VR headset no longer work at all, even after a restart, or you want to sell the headset and a reset via the app doesn't work, you can perform a factory reset from recovery mode. To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on. When the Meta logo is displayed, release the keys. In the menu that appears, select Factory Reset.\n\n**Tip 3: Reset view**\n\nTo reset the view of both your active app and the home menu, simply press and hold the meta button on the right controller for 2 seconds.\n\n**Tip 4: Refund app purchases**\n\nIf you purchased an app from the Meta Store, you can get a refund if you don't like it if you have used the app for less than 2 hours and purchased it no more than 14 days ago. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.\n\n**Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz**\n\nIf you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Display and activate \u201c120Hz refresh rate\u201d. Please note that it requires a little more battery power.\n\n**Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller**\n\nIf you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.\n\n**Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation**\n\nIf it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.\n\n**Tip 8: Avoid sunlight**\n\nMake sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds. The lenses are basically magnifying glasses and they can burn your display. It is therefore best not to use it outside or leave it near a window.\n\n**Tip 9: Avoid motion sickness**\n\nIf you are a VR beginner or generally prone to motion sickness, check how intensive the app is before you buy an app in the store. Green means comfortable, you can't get sick, but you should be more careful with the orange or even red category.\n\n**Tip 10: Room scan with furniture**\n\nYou can scan your entire room or even your entire apartment to prepare it for mixed reality apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Physical Room -&gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.\n\n**Tip 11: Developer Mode**\n\nFor some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode. To do this, go to the Meta developer page and change your account to a developer account. Then go to the smartphone app under Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Developer Settings and activate developer mode.\n\n**Tip 12: Controller Shortcuts**\n\nTo quickly take a photo of the current content of Quest 3, press the meta button on the right controller and the trigger button at the same time. The same thing works with video recordings; for this you also press the meta button but hold down the trigger a little longer. This also stops the recording. You can find the results if you press the camera symbol.\n\n**Tip 13: SideQuest + AppLab**\n\nTo access even more apps that are not in the official Meta Store, you can use the SideQuest PC software to install additional apps from the AppLab or APK files on your Quest 3. I made a [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY) about this.\n\n**Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC**\n\nYou can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless. I also made a [tutorial video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/14N78C3HtMU) about this.\n\n**Tip 15: Improve video recordings**\n\nThe Quest 3 can record video of the currently displayed content by going to the menu, clicking the camera icon, and then clicking Record Video.\n\nBut to set the recording quality and format, you have to go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Camera. Here you can make various recording settings.\n\n**Tip 16: Count calories**\n\nIf you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.\n\n**Tip 17: Watch films**\n\nYou can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3's integrated player. 3D films are also supported.\n\n**Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking**\n\nIf you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&gt; Motion Tracking -&gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.\n\n**Tip 19: Play in complete darkness**\n\nThe Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking. However, if you still want to use it in complete darkness, you will need infrared lights. A small module that you can plug directly into Quest 3 is available for purchase; you can find the link in the description. https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC\n\n**Tip 20: Save battery**\n\nTo extend the battery life of the Quest 3, you can, for example, switch off the WIFI function in the Quest 3 menu for single-player games. An extended battery mode can also be activated, which reduces the brightness, resolution and FPS to save battery. You can find this in the settings under System -&gt; Energy settings there you activate the \u201cextra battery mode\u201d.\n\n**Tip 21: Privacy settings**\n\nYou can adjust your Quest 3 privacy. Here you can, for example, set who sees your activities, create a private profile, manage device and app permissions or even assign a password to individual apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Privacy.\n\n**Tip 22: Smartphone notifications**\n\nYou can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.\n\n**Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard**\n\nYou can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.\n\n**Tip 24: Multitasking**\n\nYou can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.\n\n**Tip 25: Do not disturb**\n\nIf you don't want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.\n\n**Tip 26: App sharing**\n\nIf you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing. To do this, your friend must log in to your app under Settings and Account with their meta account on your Quest 3. You then activate app sharing in the same menu. Your friend will then have access to your game library on his Quest 3. Unfortunately, multiplayer games don't work with this.\n\n**Tip 27: Cross Buy List**\n\nSome games that you purchased from the Meta PC Store will automatically be available on your Quest 3 as standalone versions and vice versa, without you having to purchase them again. The games that support this are shown in a [list by Meta](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/). \n\n**Tip 28: Save with referral links**\n\nIf your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app -&gt; click on the three dots -&gt; then send referral link. You send the link to your friend, who then buys the game using it.\n\n**Tip 29: Install apps from your smartphone**\n\nYou can easily install apps on the Quest 3 from your smartphone. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app and then \u201cInstall to Headset\u201d.\n\n**Tip 30: Create an avatar**\n\nYou can create your own avatar for your meta account, which your friends can also see if you invite them to your home environment, for example. To do this, simply click on the mirror in your home environment and a window will open in which you can customize your avatar. You can turn the avatar mirror on and off in the settings under Personalization -&gt; Interactive Objects.\n\n**Tip 31: Activate passthrough mode quickly**\n\nTo activate the passthrough mode, that is the view of your real environment through the Quest 3, simply double-tap your hand against the Quest 3. If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.\n\n**Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes**\n\nThere are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly. The easiest, but least accurate, method is to use a ruler. It's better to have an app for your smartphone to measure the distance. You can find the link in the description. The safest method, however, is to go to an optician and have the distance measured. They often do this for free and it only takes a few seconds.\n\n**Tip 33: Disable Guardian System**\n\nIf you want to deactivate the Quest 3 security system, for example if you want to cover a larger area or for mixed reality apps, first activate the developer mode, I have already explained this to you in Tip 11. Then go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer and deactivate the guardian. However, be very careful when deactivating this security system!\n\n**Tip 34: WebVR games**\n\nYou can also play VR games with the Quest 3 via the built-in browser. To do this, open it and see a list of apps. In the \u201cBest of the Immersive Web\u201d category there are some good games and some free ones too. It takes a while for the games to start and you have to give the browser permission to start immersive apps.\n\n**Tip 35: Copy files from Quest 3**\n\nTo copy files from your Quest 3 to the PC, connect them to the PC with a USB-C cable. Then you have to confirm a dialog in Quest 3 and the file browser on the PC opens. You can find the recordings under Oculus-&gt;Videoshots, for example. Attention, the confirmation message no longer appears in Do Not Disturb mode!\n\n**Tip 36: Give help to beginners**\n\nIf you want to show Quest 3 to a friend and he is a complete beginner, you can support him during his VR session by, for example, starting apps via your smartphone. To do this, go to the smartphone app, then go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select an installed game and click \u201cStart\u201d. You can provide even more help by streaming the Quest 3 content to your phone. To do this, click on \u201cStream\u201d in the smartphone app under Menu -&gt; Devices -&gt; Meta Quest 3 -&gt;, select Meta Quest 3 again and press \u201cStart\u201d. Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.\n\n**Tip 37: Use hand straps**\n\nIt can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment. Especially when you throw things around in VR, you might end up throwing the controller into your window or the TV. It is therefore essential to always use the hand straps on the controllers, even if it means a few seconds more preparation time.\n\n**Tip 38: Change your virtual environment**\n\nYou can change the default home environment and, for example, beam yourself into a cyber city. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Virtual Environment and select a different environment. If you scroll all the way down, you can even use your own 360 degree image as your home environment.\n\n**Tip 39: Check for updates**\n\nYour Quest 3 does not always install the updates automatically. To check whether there is a new update, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Software Update. If an update is available here, it will be offered to you. Also activate the option \u201cAutomatically turn on the headset for updates\u201d to always have the latest updates, even if the quest is turned off.\n\n**Tip 40: Accessories**\n\nAs accessories, I can recommend the VR Cover for the facial interface, the original Elite Strap with battery or the M3 Pro Set from BoboVR. The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.\n\nIf you have time, I made a [20min video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs) about those tipps and tricks as well.  \nI hope there are some useful things for you in this list.  \nCheers  \nThomas","author_fullname":"t2_suryn","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"40 Tips And Tricks For META QUEST 3 For Beginners And Pros","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Content Creator) - Standalone"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/OculusQuest","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17fa4qo","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Content Creator) - Standalone","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1698145470.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.OculusQuest","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;br\/&gt;\nI spent many days (and nights) to gather some cool tips and tricks for the Quest 3, here you go:  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 1: Casting to other devices&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By clicking on the camera button in the Quest 3 menu, you can stream the current view of Quest 3 to a TV, a browser or your cell phone so that your friends can watch you play.

To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on.

To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &amp;gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode.

Please note that it requires a little more battery power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 8: Avoid sunlight&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds.

To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Physical Room -&amp;gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 11: Developer Mode&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode.

I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY\"&gt;video&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless.

Here you can make various recording settings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 16: Count calories&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 17: Watch films&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3&amp;#39;s integrated player. 3D films are also supported.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Motion Tracking -&amp;gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 19: Play in complete darkness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking.

To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Privacy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 22: Smartphone notifications&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 24: Multitasking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 25: Do not disturb&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 26: App sharing&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing. To do this, your friend must log in to your app under Settings and Account with their meta account on your Quest 3. You then activate app sharing in the same menu. Your friend will then have access to your game library on his Quest 3. Unfortunately, multiplayer games don&amp;#39;t work with this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 27: Cross Buy List&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some games that you purchased from the Meta PC Store will automatically be available on your Quest 3 as standalone versions and vice versa, without you having to purchase them again. The games that support this are shown in a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/\"&gt;list by Meta&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 28: Save with referral links&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store. To do this, go to Menu -&amp;gt; My Library -&amp;gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app -&amp;gt; click on the three dots -&amp;gt; then send referral link. You send the link to your friend, who then buys the game using it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 29: Install apps from your smartphone&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can easily install apps on the Quest 3 from your smartphone. To do this, go to Menu -&amp;gt; My Library -&amp;gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app and then \u201cInstall to Headset\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 30: Create an avatar&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can create your own avatar for your meta account, which your friends can also see if you invite them to your home environment, for example. To do this, simply click on the mirror in your home environment and a window will open in which you can customize your avatar. You can turn the avatar mirror on and off in the settings under Personalization -&amp;gt; Interactive Objects.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 31: Activate passthrough mode quickly&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To activate the passthrough mode, that is the view of your real environment through the Quest 3, simply double-tap your hand against the Quest 3. If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&amp;gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly. The easiest, but least accurate, method is to use a ruler. It&amp;#39;s better to have an app for your smartphone to measure the distance. You can find the link in the description. The safest method, however, is to go to an optician and have the distance measured. They often do this for free and it only takes a few seconds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 33: Disable Guardian System&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to deactivate the Quest 3 security system, for example if you want to cover a larger area or for mixed reality apps, first activate the developer mode, I have already explained this to you in Tip 11. Then go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Developer and deactivate the guardian. However, be very careful when deactivating this security system!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 34: WebVR games&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also play VR games with the Quest 3 via the built-in browser. To do this, open it and see a list of apps. In the \u201cBest of the Immersive Web\u201d category there are some good games and some free ones too. It takes a while for the games to start and you have to give the browser permission to start immersive apps.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 35: Copy files from Quest 3&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To copy files from your Quest 3 to the PC, connect them to the PC with a USB-C cable. Then you have to confirm a dialog in Quest 3 and the file browser on the PC opens. You can find the recordings under Oculus-&amp;gt;Videoshots, for example. Attention, the confirmation message no longer appears in Do Not Disturb mode!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 36: Give help to beginners&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to show Quest 3 to a friend and he is a complete beginner, you can support him during his VR session by, for example, starting apps via your smartphone. To do this, go to the smartphone app, then go to Menu -&amp;gt; My Library -&amp;gt; select an installed game and click \u201cStart\u201d. You can provide even more help by streaming the Quest 3 content to your phone. To do this, click on \u201cStream\u201d in the smartphone app under Menu -&amp;gt; Devices -&amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 -&amp;gt;, select Meta Quest 3 again and press \u201cStart\u201d. Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 37: Use hand straps&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment. Especially when you throw things around in VR, you might end up throwing the controller into your window or the TV. It is therefore essential to always use the hand straps on the controllers, even if it means a few seconds more preparation time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 38: Change your virtual environment&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can change the default home environment and, for example, beam yourself into a cyber city. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Personalization -&amp;gt; Virtual Environment and select a different environment. If you scroll all the way down, you can even use your own 360 degree image as your home environment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 39: Check for updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your Quest 3 does not always install the updates automatically. To check whether there is a new update, go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Software Update. If an update is available here, it will be offered to you. Also activate the option \u201cAutomatically turn on the headset for updates\u201d to always have the latest updates, even if the quest is turned off.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 40: Accessories&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As accessories, I can recommend the VR Cover for the facial interface, the original Elite Strap with battery or the M3 Pro Set from BoboVR. The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have time, I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs\"&gt;20min video&lt;\/a&gt; about those tipps and tricks as well.&lt;br\/&gt;\nI hope there are some useful things for you in this list.&lt;br\/&gt;\nCheers&lt;br\/&gt;\nThomas&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a0f4d7ad1b8d9ef1efc0017f1a4e150a83bc388c","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e99ced9e98c0c173af1b65d2471f89b0bd097b36","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda6f1786a827b772babe119bcc83b791ac058ce","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/bIxsZ4R47hANmkGFkzBTkWOvx_yoTmv895XZXOLIq-I.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef4e2fe968aff71a134738169740f25ab4db7ad8","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"p5gn6u-c1-vedY3PYi49g4B8NN1nVAc5ulhUpBOvw6E"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"4d71f698-13af-11ed-b06d-c62004b4372a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_p2wzd","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"17fa4qo","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"VoodooDE","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17fa4qo\/40_tips_and_tricks_for_meta_quest_3_for_beginners\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/OculusQuest\/comments\/17fa4qo\/40_tips_and_tricks_for_meta_quest_3_for_beginners\/","subreddit_subscribers":456287,"created_utc":1698145470.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"OculusQuest","selftext":"I'm trying to play Elite Dangerous through VD and Steam, but I can't get any controllers to work.

Today, I'm going to walk you through setting up GeForce Now (GFN) on your Meta Quest 2 or Quest 3. This guide assumes you have a gamepad that can be paired via Bluetooth, like a DualShock 4, DualSense, Xbox Controller or any other BT gamepad, as you will use it to play on the device. \n\nAlso, please note, you could only play \"flat\" games this way, however you can do it on a virtual screen as large as you can imagine, so I believe it worths it.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n* A working GFN account.\n* Obviously, a Meta Quest 2 or Quest 3 headset. (I actually haven't tried it with the Quest 3 but expect it to work the same) \n* A Bluetooth gamepad (I used DualShock 4, but again, I believe it should work with any other Bluetooth controller just fine)\n* SideQuest set up on your computer (There are plenty instructions online on how to do it, including the SideQuest website [https:\/\/sidequestvr.com\/setup-howto](https:\/\/sidequestvr.com\/setup-howto). Please make sure you\u2019re downloading an \u201cAdvanced\u201d installer, as the \u201cEasy Installer\u201d seems doesn\u2019t have a way to install APKs). \n\n**Now to the main course:** \n\n**Step 1. Pair Your Bluetooth Gamepad**\n\n* Go to Settings on your Quest headset.\n* Navigate to Devices &gt; Bluetooth &gt; Pair &gt; Pair New device \n* Put your controller into a pairing mode.\n* Select a gamepad from the list once it\u2019s showed up.\n\n**Step 2. Install Chrome via SideQuest**\n\n* From your computer, download Chrome APK. You can get it from APKPure or other sites.\n* Sideload Chrome APK to the headset using SideQuest (If you have never done it - there is a button for that in the SideQuest UI in the left top corner).\n\n**Step 3. Open Chrome on Quest**\n\n* Open \"App Library\" on your Quest.\n* Click on the search bar, then click on the \"All\" selector on the right-hand side.\n* Select \"Unknown Sources\" from the dropdown.\n* Find and open Chrome.\n\n**Step 4. Adjust Chrome window size**\n\n* Chrome will launch in a vertical window. Expand the window by dragging one of the corners.\n* If you can't expand, click on the clock on the dock and select \"Switch View\" to toggle between close-up and big-screen modes.\n* Please note: Switching from Chrome to another window may \u201cclose\" Chrome, so you'll need to reopen it from the App Library.\n\n**Step 4. Log into GeForce Now**\n\n* Navigate to play.geforcenow.com\n* Log in to your GFN account. I was using keyboard and mouse for that but it\u2019s not necessary. \n* (Optional but recommended) Once logged in - Go to GFN settings (three bars in the left top corner) and set your desired resolution (I use 1920x1200). Click the three bars again, then select \"Games\" to get back to the games list.\n\n**Step 5. Start a Game**\n\n* Start your game. \n* In order for Chrome to capture the controller, press Start+Select (which is Share+Options on Sony controllers). Pro-Tip: You can switch between modes (capture and release game controls) by pressing Start+Select again. This way you could use controller buttons to \u201cclick\u201d on the game you\u2019re looking at without using Quest controllers or hands, and then switch to play the game itself. \n\nA caveat: Games requiring mouse input may not work properly, even if you have an actual mouse connected to the device. That includes logging into the Xbox Store in order to play GamePass games on a device, as well as clicking on Steam or EGS popups saying that the cloud save is newer\/older than the one of the machine, etc. Sometimes you can get away with that if you connect a keyboard and \u201cTab\u201d your way to the button you need to click, but in others it doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThat should be it.
