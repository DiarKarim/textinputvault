Just to test I tried both Walking Dead Saints and Sinners and Blade and Sorcery and both run just fine with both AirLink and Virtual Desktop. It&amp;#39;s like I screwed up the settings specifically for AZ2. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anybody know what might be causing this? For context my setup is an Asus Rog Striz with an R5900hs processor, 16 gigs RAM, a laptop RTX 3070 and a WiFi 6 router with 1200Mbps transfer speed&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON

The point seems to roughly follow your index finger, and if if doesn't then it should because that seems more intuitive anyway.

There is little to no information on if this is possible for the dozens of us who still have Quest 1s and want to upgrade to a Quest 2 or 3. It is not only possible, but it\u2019s possible to both get the referral credit and keep your free bonus game, such as Asgard\u2019s Wrath 2. The Quest Referral Program, which lets you get the referral bonus within seven days of the device's purchase, and the bonus game offers work different, which is based on the account it's first activated on. I've chatted with Meta customer support and since you don't have a Quest 2 or 3, it is condoned and even suggested by their customer support since you're not self-referring yourself and you can't even have your own referral link unless you have a Quest 2\/3\/Pro attached to your account. \n\nThe only thing other than a smartphone you need is a separate email address to create a new Meta account.\n\nDisclaimer: This is based on chatting with Meta customer support and it\u2019s an official policy, it can change at any time (at the end of the day I am just a person on the internet passing knowledge along. Also, for transparency, I will post my referral links in the post.\n\nIf you are upgrading to a Quest 2, skip past the --- section since at the moment there are no bonus games for purchasing a Quest 2.\n\n---\n\nImportant - If you are getting a Quest 3 and there is a free game promotion (such as Asgard's Wrath 2): Setup your Quest 3 with your primary Oculus\/Meta account. Once you login to the Quest 3 with your primary Meta\/Oculus account, you'll get an email confirmation saying to redeem the offer. Redeem it immediately; that way, the game will be registered with that account instead of the secondary account you'll create in a few moments. You can confirm in the Quest app store that the game is attached to your account (\"redeemed with your headset purchase\"). \n\nAfter you do that, [go to this link and delete the Quest 3 from your account](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/), you'll get an email confirmation that a remote wipe has been indicated. Wait a moment and turn off\/turn on your headset. Upon bootup, the device will automatically restart on its own and will do a factory reset. (Continue with the steps below to utilize the Quest Referral Program)\n\n---\n\nIn the Meta Quest app, go to the settings section of the app and log out. You'll be prompted to login or create a Meta account. Click on \"continue with email\" and create a new Meta account, using either a spare email address including but not limited to via Gmail, iCloud+'s Hide My Email feature, or even [DuckDuckGo's email feature](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/email\/).\n\n*Before* you log into the Quest 2\/3 with your secondary Meta account, activate the referral program on your account via a referral link of your choice. [Here is my referral link if you need one or want to show your thanks for the guide.](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/referrals\/link\/darabo) :)\nMake sure you see [this page](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/bd7hYH0) showing you're ready before moving forward (try the above step again if you didn't get that page).\n\nNow that your secondary Meta account has a referral attached to it, simply set up your Quest 2\/3 with this account. Upon successfully setting up the device, go to the \"Wallet\" section in the Settings tab of the Meta Quest app to confirm the $30 has been added to your account, it should have been immediately added to your account (it'll take 30 days for the sender to receive their $30 credit).\n\nWith your $30 credit, you can gift games\/apps to your primary account no problem. To make the credit go even further, you can utilize referral links for certain apps for a 25% discount, which will even be applied to apps gifted to your primary or another Meta\/Oculus account. I'll post my recommendations, with referral links, at the end of the post. *Before* you purchase any game, click on the referral link for that app and get confirmation for the discount to work. It won't work if you do it afterwards. Many people have posted their respective referral links in different subreddits, other websites, etc. \n\n\nWhen you want to gift a game\/app to your primary Oculus\/Meta account, find your primary account via your Meta\/Oculus username or email address. It'll caution you that you two aren't friends and to be careful, but simply proceed. If you're super cautious about it, you can send it to your primary email address and redeem the code in your Quest app. You have up to 30 days to redeem the code, otherwise it'll be voided and your secondary account will get a refund.\n\nOnce you utilize all your store credit, you can either sign into your primary account in the headset (you can have up to four accounts active in your headset, including purchase sharing), or do another [factory reset](https:\/\/secure.oculus.com\/my\/devices\/) and set up the device again to have your primary account the admin for the headset. Don't worry, your purchases, gifted or not, will stay in your account.\n\nHere are some games I highly recommend for the Quest (with my referral links of course, but no pressure :) ):\n\n*[Beat Saber](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2448060205267927\/): The game so popular Facebook\/Meta acquired the studio.

All three games are well worth getting.\n\n* [Tetris Effect](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/3386618894743567\/): Think Tetris but on psychedelics. You'd think playing Tetris in VR would be kind of meh, but this game is surprisingly moving with clear passion from the developers. The developers have optimized the game for the Quest 3 with a graphics \"fidelity\" mode that makes the game look *much* better, almost exactly like the PCVR version.\n\n* [Walkabout Mini Golf](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2462678267173943\/): A fabulous mini-golf game.\n\n* [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/appreferrals\/darabo\/2010043642376517\/): A fun party game to play with others.

I've also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I've updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.\n\nIt's been a very long time since I've updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can't quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I've decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I'll only go into the main ones here.\n\n# OpenXR Update\n\n**Core SDK is now OpenXR**\n\nSo if you follow any VR news you'll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR. I've removed these and replaced them with the OpenXR system.\n\n**Advantages of OpenXR**\n\nOpenXR is in constant development with improvements that will carry down to all headsets.\n\nYou will be able to use your headset with the VR front you desire. OpenXR is fully compatible with SteamVR, Oculus Store and Windows Mixed Reality Portal. This means when using Whirligig from Steam you are not forced to use SteamVR. With direct support from each platform any performance improvements those platforms use will be filtered down into Whirligig.\n\nOpenXR implementation has meant I've removed the input options for both Oculus and Steam replacing it with a universal controller and some core controllers to use. You could select different controller skins when using Oculus. Now this feature is available on all setups.\n\nQuicker updates to other platforms. As all builds have been brought under one sdk I can now release the same version on different platforms with little change to the code. This will help to reduce bugs being introduced into other versions when updating and help my confidence that when I update I won't be breaking everyone's experience.\n\nI can develop for both PC and Mobile headsets at the same time.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nOpenXR is new and in constant flux. For development this is both advantages and crippling as currently every update to the SDK can cause issues in multiple ways. This will improve greatly over time but currently it's making supporting some headsets (mostly mobile headsets) quite difficult.\n\nSome features aren't working. Basically the UserPresent (what happens when the headset is put on or removed) feature isn't working properly. I will be implementing this back in once it's back up and running.\n\n# VLC VideoLan plugin update\n\nWhirligig offers 4 video path options to allow for the largest range of compatibility, Media Foundation, WinRT, Directshow and VideoLan. Media Foundation, WinRT and Directshow are available using the AVPro Renderheads plugin which is well supported by the developers, however the plugin that ran the VLC VideoLan support was no longer supported I have replaced the old plugin with an official VLC Video plugin made by the VideoLan guys themselves. This is much better supported and provides a host of improvements over the previous plugin.\n\n**VLC VideoLan integration improvements**\n\n* Greatly improved performance when using VLC video path (GPU decoding).\n* Using the latest VLC dlls, which provides the widest and most up to date media support.\n* Extra image support. Whirligig now supports xcf, gif, tiff, tif, ilbm, pcx, tga, bmp, pnm, webp, bpg, jpeg, jpg, jps, png, pns image formats. If there are any file types that I've not included but VLC does let me know and I'll add it to the list.\n\n# Future use of the VLC plugin\n\nThe official VLC plugin supports all the same features that the VLC player has, which allows me to open up other areas of support. The biggest one will be playback of streaming media from external locations. This will be more significant for mobile Whirligig as network playback support is often requested. There are several other additions I wish to look into but if anyone else has any ideas let me know.\n\n# Explorer improvements\n\nThe explorer in Whirligig has been functional but has needed updating for a while. I've redesigned a good part of it, worked on optimisations and fixed any bugs I've come across.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Explorer text based ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=675c0a9ceefba25524aed3da0dbe307fb48dec31)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ explorer visual explorer ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6249495f5724bf987d0acfa8ce3c7d9e1e4abff)\n\n# Audio reactive backgrounds\n\nAs I am using media playback systems that also support audio I've worked on adding audio reactive backgrounds to the player. When playing audio if you select one of these backgrounds, the environment will move and pulse to the audio as it plays. The audio backgrounds are 3D 360 environments and there are currently 7 to choose from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Audio backgrounds ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368ef53b9f67b608fe01abdc9646fd907f8bbaad)\n\nCurrently it only works with Media Foundation and WinRT video paths for playing back audio.\n\n# Optimisation\n\nA significant amount of my time has been put into optimisation of code, especially in the input detection system I've created. Whirligig should now be snappier and feel smoother.\n\n# Engine and plugin updates\n\nWith VR being in constant development, keeping everything up to date is a must to ensure compatibility and gain performance improvements from the latest OpenXR versions. This version of Whirligig is currently running on Unity 2022.3.13f1 (as of release the latest 2022 version) and OpenXR 1.9.1.\n\n# Bug fixes\n\nI've continued to fix reported bugs and any bugs I've come across as I go along. With the major updates that I've been making there is always a chance I've broken things so any reports on issues are very welcome.\n\n# Additional Releases\n\nWhirligig is available on multiple platforms and multiple headsets and this release is going to signify an update release on all of the platforms bringing every version in line with each other.\n\nWhen it comes to betas I mostly release these on Steam so for beta versions Steam is the place to go. Sadly there isn't a universal store for Standalone VR yet so I've provided Ich.io for sideloading on some headsets and will be adding Whirligig to each of the manufactures stores if I can be accepted onto them.\n\nI've always held a policy that if you own Whirligig on any other platform you can request a code of another platform for free. Here is a list of the current platforms Whirligig is on\n\n**PC VR**\n\n* Steam Store\n* Oculus Store\n* Viveport\n* Pimax Store\n\n**Mobile VR**\n\n* Applabs (Quest 2\/3)\n* Ich.io (Quest 2\/3, Oculus Go, Pico)\n* Pimax Store (Pimax Crystal)\n\nIf you have Whirligig on any of these stores and wish to access one of the other stores email me [phileday@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:phileday@yahoo.co.uk) with proof of purchase (Screenshot of it in your library or something like that) and I'll send you a code for the store you wish.\n\nHopefully all the updates I've been making will improve the ability for me to support more headsets so keep an eye out for new headset support in the future.\n\n# Your feedback\n\nI am very happy to get feedback from the people who use Whirligig and most fixes and new features come from suggestions from all of you. If you have any suggestions or issues please let me know (comment here or post in the forum) and I'll do my best to implement and fix things. I want to continue to develop Whirligig into the foreseeable future so ways I can improve it for your needs the better.\n\n# User reviews\n\nOne of the reasons I've not updated on the Oculus Store in so long is because of the chances of getting bad reviews. I'm aware I've made very large improvements and changes over the last default release but here is where the issue lies. Because it's such a big jump it can really frustrate people who were expecting to load Whirligig in the same way as before and are presented with an update. This normally throws out a few bad reviews off the bat.\n\nSo I'm just asking that if you like the update and you're happy with Whirligig please review it. If you don't a negative review is fine however please be constructive so I can address any problems you have.\n\nPositive reviews really do matter to me as it tells me that I'm continuing to improve things and make a good product. This is also true for negative feedback when it is constructive as it allows me to address the issues that are brought up. If you do write a review whether it's negative or positive I'll do my best to address any issues or improve Whirligig as best as I can. I look forward to your feedback :)\n\n# And finally\n\nI'd just like to thank everyone who has supported this project (just by purchasing you're supporting and positive reviews are always welcome). Without the community who has commented, made suggestions and reported bugs I wouldn't of continued to develop Whirligig. This is all very appreciated.\n\nI hope you like the new update and I wish everyone happiness for the future. Keep watching :)\n\nPhil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_p6s1i","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Whirligig VR media player update with some major additions","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"slategrey","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":108,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"media_metadata":{"0xxs9qk9hc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541cc0645205240670e8c735f3604d6fb4b4bb3a"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aa5620098cdd4d558cd72be5e91413581367a95"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e7dc6bd261e42a7c1026d8313c2eb96fe17a3bd"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc0abd1e34c3690776fd79351a3ab7c62d8025f"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dc5ed97aba42a4a5be88a5dac9a435017aa5d"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ac3d1e6e697b3a4a5c8e8c5cac05a9a1049003"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=675c0a9ceefba25524aed3da0dbe307fb48dec31"},"id":"0xxs9qk9hc2c1"},"4fy4bcrbhc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2672b40f6c6e05eeb716067f1fc6ca3b2358bc76"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500caf8a95f99c4e69d33e93b89dd76b6d9b0e6b"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6933c8a6402552ba4a5b0b97049a0f7bdb05f7e5"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b271957e90c29b52d7779fc449ad3579c3ab59a4"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37345e563d5a94a8a6dd510c30273244eb05c651"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0771c69e76c590f028b17cf983203b7fd66ed2ba"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6249495f5724bf987d0acfa8ce3c7d9e1e4abff"},"id":"4fy4bcrbhc2c1"},"s8uzrildhc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":86,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c24fe694c324e031003f0b65b922048e0dbff3"},{"y":173,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=753c3a7dc12ced28011b19d59941e3d791d677a4"},{"y":256,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abb3fe20a2e2a3aba88fdc5bd7b1343a6cf9f5b3"},{"y":512,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7e340b270567e8786db4b68f4a2cb56838dd01"}],"s":{"y":670,"x":836,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368ef53b9f67b608fe01abdc9646fd907f8bbaad"},"id":"s8uzrildhc2c1"}},"name":"t3_182zkhx","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":140,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/QQEHJKcXpuBNm6K-7MHTbNzHHnG3xFlvKK6bpzrFEDY.jpg","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700853118.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly before I go on, I recreated this post from the news update I did on Steam as I updated the steam default build first. I&amp;#39;ve also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I&amp;#39;ve updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a very long time since I&amp;#39;ve updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can&amp;#39;t quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I&amp;#39;ve decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I&amp;#39;ll only go into the main ones here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;OpenXR Update&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core SDK is now OpenXR&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you follow any VR news you&amp;#39;ll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR.

This normally throws out a few bad reviews off the bat.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m just asking that if you like the update and you&amp;#39;re happy with Whirligig please review it. If you don&amp;#39;t a negative review is fine however please be constructive so I can address any problems you have.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Positive reviews really do matter to me as it tells me that I&amp;#39;m continuing to improve things and make a good product. This is also true for negative feedback when it is constructive as it allows me to address the issues that are brought up. If you do write a review whether it&amp;#39;s negative or positive I&amp;#39;ll do my best to address any issues or improve Whirligig as best as I can. I look forward to your feedback :)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;And finally&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d just like to thank everyone who has supported this project (just by purchasing you&amp;#39;re supporting and positive reviews are always welcome). Without the community who has commented, made suggestions and reported bugs I wouldn&amp;#39;t of continued to develop Whirligig. This is all very appreciated.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you like the new update and I wish everyone happiness for the future. Keep watching :)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Phil&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"3bb1cc6a-a036-11ea-83a2-0e0b6f201cff","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#dadada","id":"182zkhx","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"phileday","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/182zkhx\/whirligig_vr_media_player_update_with_some_major\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/182zkhx\/whirligig_vr_media_player_update_with_some_major\/","subreddit_subscribers":493179,"created_utc":1700853118.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"oculus","selftext":"What s going on with the PC download speeds?

Spine issues, heart issues, muscle inactivity, and many more health-related as well as lifestyle-related issues have been linked to video games, possibly for a good reason. It's easy to fall into the grasp of addiction and just crash all your free time into the world's most subtle escape from reality. Buried under the pile of countless critics, gaming has had more than a fair share of judgment from all social groups. Well, I'm here to offer another perspective - an outlook on how video games changed someone's life for the better and helped them become a better human being overall.\n\nI'd like to start with the negatives. Addiction to video games? 3 times. And 3 solid recoveries. With the experience I have today, I can say that every time my life went downhill, video games substituted as life's motherly arms for all my fears and burdens. But as every baby bird has to leave its nest at some point, I did too. Along this journey, I discovered VR gaming which at first, looked like another cool way of spending my time in the virtual world. Playing games like Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Clash of Chefs, and others gave me a new perspective of how awesome gaming *could* be in the future, but also a new idea. What if I could utilize the new dimension inherent only to VR to my advantage? What if I could improve my life *while* doing something I love, and turn my prolonged gaming periods that would otherwise have a negative impact on my health into something that would improve me physically, while also helping me deal with my mental issues? What if I could turn this into a win-win situation?\n\n**Fitness games &amp; their benefits**\n\nThe \"dimension inherent to VR\" I mentioned before refers mainly to the 3rd dimension present in VR gaming that's absent in all other forms of gaming. Similarly to how the Heliocentric system changed our entire understanding of how the world around us functioned, the physicality of the VR's third dimension changed my perception of how gaming could work. Instead of being stuck to a chair and looking into a 2D, flat screen for hours, I had the opportunity to play while being active in my room, with my body as a controller. That's when I looked for ways to combine the enjoyment of playing a game with the perk of being physically active and ultimately decided on 2 games.\n\nI got myself **Beat Saber** and **PowerBeatsVR**, of which the latter provided me with an exceptional way to keep my body in shape. Just a few high intensity runs in this game made me fight for breath completely covered in sweat, even though I wasn't *that* out of shape. The most important part for me was the option to choose my own music because the music I enjoy changes depending on my mood, and when I'm not mentally well, my mood changes rather quickly. Even irl I jump between oldschool rock, blues, powermetal, and folk music literally song by song. I made a plan and stuck to it - daily runs of 30 to 60 minutes in PowerBeatsVR with my own, custom songs, and as hard as I could go. I lost a few pounds, tightened my muscles, and overall felt much more energized on a daily basis due to being physically active. The best part was that I was enjoying every moment in the game because it represented something familiar and safe to me - a *video game* with real video game features, cool sceneries, etc. If you're struggling right now with improving your physical fitness or just want to do something healthy for yourself in your free time, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game. It works even for people who are extremely out of shape or injured because you can choose your own pace.\n\nI'd also recommend Beat Saber for the same purpose. It's leaning more toward the *game* than the *fitness* part, but it'll also burn a few calories if you do the runs correctly. Just be careful not to dislocate or hurt your shoulder\/arm (it happened to me twice) and make sure to warm up properly before doing harder runs (especially if you're above 30 hahaha). Either way, you'll have a ton of fun while doing something good for yourself, and that's always a plus.\n\n**Mental health benefits**\n\nNow, this is one of the things VR games share with flatscreen games - mental health benefits - although I'd argue VR games could have an edge solely because of the unmatched immersiveness. I can't explain how much **Into the Radius** and **Resident Evil 4 VR** helped me deal with anxiety, an issue I'd been battling for years. Playing these games helped me get in touch with my anxious side and understand fear better, at least in terms of how it functions in my dysfunctional body. I could sense and tell apart real fear from anxious attacks, and subsequently deal with them before they get control over me. Plus, my fear tolerance increased significantly.\n\nThen I'd also like to mention the games like **Deisim** or **cyubeVR** that provide a cozy and fun environment to just lose yourself in, relax, and have fun. If life gets too rough, this could be the right way to deal with it, although be careful not to stray too far.\n\n**Fun &amp; Entertainment**\n\nLast but not least, VR games have always provided so much fun to me for a very affordable price. One of the reasons I became a gamer as a kid was because my family didn't do too well financially. We sometimes couldn't afford to go to lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., and I as a kid learned to cherish and save every $ we had. Video games were the cheapest form of entertainment I could have - $500 for a PC that lasted for 4 years and $10-$30 per game was so much cheaper than going out to cafes, bars, and when online games came around, I could even hang out with friends while playing games.\n\nIn today's world, VR is arguably one of the best ways to have fun and experience some things second-handedly while being in the comfort of your home and saving your money. With so many simulators and interesting apps out there, virtually anything from the real world can be done in VR with a bit of creativity. Although I'm not an expert, some games still left an oustanding impact on me -  **Wooorld**, **Bartender Simulator VR**, **Cooking Simulator VR**, **Clash of Chefs**, **Nature Treks VR**, and **The Climb**.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nTo wrap this up, I'll return to the beginning of the article and say that VR, like any other form of gaming, can impact your life negatively if used excessively. No matter how good you feel doing even some cool, extraordinary things in VR, don't do it too much or too obsessively. HOWEVER, if you want to utilize VR to your advantage, I'd say the games I mentioned in this post could be perfect for that. PowerBeatsVR will help you get in shape for sure, and you'll have a ton of fun doing it. Into the Radius could help you deal with anxiety, but don't force yourself too much if the feeling overwhelms you. The Climb is a solid climbing simulator and it'll let you experience the sport second-hand, without you risking anything. There are more examples like Nature Treks VR which lets you experience the immersiveness of nature without having to step a foot outside, or Beat Saber which will have you burning extra calories while competing for high scores in a rhythm game. And these are only some examples that I've done in the past, just imagine how much more is out there.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, VR games helped me change my life for the better and find new ways of bettering myself in things I've never thought possible before. Hope it does the same for you.\n\nCheers!\n\n\\*NOTE - I highlighted all the games so you don't have to go through the blocks of text searching for them in case you wanna look them up.","author_fullname":"t2_rzvf7gwg","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"VR games changed my life for the better and I'm tremendously thankful for experiencing this form of gaming","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"seagreen","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17viatm","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Tips &amp; Tricks","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700012233.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a stigma since the existence of gaming that video games are &amp;quot;bad for you&amp;quot;, especially if played extensively.

Setting this value to 3968 resulted in ODT reporting the encoder resolution @ 3968x2080, and NVENC was continuing to maintain frame. So. Much. Better.)*\n\n# Bonus\/Honorable Mentions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Holy hell you can disable Oculus Dash! [https:\/\/github.com\/LibreQuest\/OculusKiller\/tree\/main\/OculusKiller](https:\/\/github.com\/LibreQuest\/OculusKiller\/tree\/main\/OculusKiller) When this you cant play Rift games (unless through revive :\/) and there is some awkwardness with quitting steam vr (it auto restarts if the airlink connection is still active, so just shut down oculus home instead), but this is otherwise totally awesome. Unless you play lots of Rift Games and\/or can spare the video memory, considering disabling Dash, and then maybe also forcing the use of the SteamVR API by setting to be both the default OpenXR runtime and also enabling the experimental option in OpenVR advanced settings that attempts to force games to run in SteamVR mode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I maintain the superstition compelling me to force the OVR\\_Server process to 'High' priority, and I found a nice way to force that without having to install 'Oculus Tray Tool': [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/k6he9b\/comment\/jon4ia1\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/k6he9b\/comment\/jon4ia1\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) . You might need to allow powershell to execute scripts: [https:\/\/superuser.com\/a\/106363](https:\/\/superuser.com\/a\/106363)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Still a bit foggy on this. I enabled 'Universe Centered Rotation' in Open VR Advanced Settings in an effort to get something close to Virtual Desktop's quite effective 'Stage Centered Tracking'. This is useful if you want\/need to play SteamVR games in a more roomscale fashion, and in the case of VD, it keeps the SteamVR playspace (not the chaperone) locked in the proper place -- with Airlink the playspace is at some random rotation, but the center marker stays put, which is at least half correct.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Enabling VRSS (if your favorite game supports it) in the Nvidia Control Panel could be fun also. Were I to be on a potatoe GPU, I might also hazard an attempt at lowering the Texture Filtering to 'Performance' mode and enabling the Sample Optimization option. If even possible, that poor player is likely not going to notice the reduction in texture filtering through a hastily encoded low resolution stream anyway, and it could reduce frame times a decent amount right? Why else would standalone titles have such weak anistrophic filtering, eh? See the Crimson guide if you really need to outfit a weak system: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/uwigp9\/crimsons\\_new\\_and\\_improved\\_guide\\_to\\_optimizing\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/uwigp9\/crimsons_new_and_improved_guide_to_optimizing\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Words:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been trying to find Morpheus through the staticky fog of wireless VR for a few years now. As others may attest, through the trials and tribulations of swapping out routers, updates, update bugs, experimental features, etc, it's somewhat of a two steps forward, one step back situation, eh. I had Virtual Desktop before Airlink was a thing, but the latter seemed to work better on a crappy TP Link router, so I wasn't able to use the solution many people were making earnest claims to being better for a long time. Then I got my Asus router (mwah) and switched to VD and couldn't stop raving about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen after about a year or so of updates (juicy ones) something either changed (I think it was sliced encoding) or my want for a more smooth experience jumped up a notch, and I couldn't figure out how to iron out some pretty consistent problems with micro judder. I can reinstall VD right now, set it to low, use any of the codecs, jump down into the streets of MythOS city, wave my hands in front of my face all john cena like and get that horrible hitching. Again, I think it's sliced encoding, which might now be only disable-able in some kind of registry option? Is it tracking stutter? With my airlink setup, I glide down the tube onto the pavement and flash gang signs to the dead null men without a hitch at a frame time so low I'm pretty sure I should be running this all at a higher resolution tick in the Oculus Home slider. I'm bustin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVD has alot of convenience features I really enjoyed, for both the desktop, video playback, and vr streaming sides. You can notice the improvement in color banding when the added HEVC 10Bit, I will miss that. There are dozens upon dozens of (non game streaming) applications\/spam that aim to implement only some of what Virtual Desktop does. Were I to need to do lots of Cinema watching, or desktop work with my headset on (which I generally don't but think it's important) I would just use Virtual Desktop. Atm though, I'm back to Airlink, and it's so smooth. I also tried the recent version of ALVR (just for fun) and they're super far along in their progress, and it has lots of bells and whistles to play with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYMMV glhf","author_fullname":"t2_yknb1","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"An \"AirLink works better for me than Virtual Desktop\" VR Wireless Performance Guide","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_160deym","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1692909406.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;For a school project my teacher told me to make my wireless VR system smooth like butter and also to show my work. &lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My System Specs (midrange 90hz battered veteran):&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Ryzen 5600X, 64Gb 3600 DDR4, RTX 3060TI&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Windows 10 LTSC (very clean install: TODO)&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Asus RT-AX55 [quad core model, #2 on the VD recommended list] with 5ghz for VR only (more or less) \\&lt;\/em&gt;flawless**&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tweaks Performed&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OCULUS&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changed 72hz @ 4128x2096 (Auto) to 90hz @ 3936x1984 (one tick above the auto for 90)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I insist on 90hz for myself, but in a prior life (on Index) I was an 80hz guy from time to time.

Unless you play lots of Rift Games and\/or can spare the video memory, considering disabling Dash, and then maybe also forcing the use of the SteamVR API by setting to be both the default OpenXR runtime and also enabling the experimental option in OpenVR advanced settings that attempts to force games to run in SteamVR mode.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I maintain the superstition compelling me to force the OVR_Server process to &amp;#39;High&amp;#39; priority, and I found a nice way to force that without having to install &amp;#39;Oculus Tray Tool&amp;#39;: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/k6he9b\/comment\/jon4ia1\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3\"&gt;https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/k6he9b\/comment\/jon4ia1\/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3&lt;\/a&gt; . You might need to allow powershell to execute scripts: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/superuser.com\/a\/106363\"&gt;https:\/\/superuser.com\/a\/106363&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Still a bit foggy on this. I enabled &amp;#39;Universe Centered Rotation&amp;#39; in Open VR Advanced Settings in an effort to get something close to Virtual Desktop&amp;#39;s quite effective &amp;#39;Stage Centered Tracking&amp;#39;. This is useful if you want\/need to play SteamVR games in a more roomscale fashion, and in the case of VD, it keeps the SteamVR playspace (not the chaperone) locked in the proper place -- with Airlink the playspace is at some random rotation, but the center marker stays put, which is at least half correct.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enabling VRSS (if your favorite game supports it) in the Nvidia Control Panel could be fun also. Were I to be on a potatoe GPU, I might also hazard an attempt at lowering the Texture Filtering to &amp;#39;Performance&amp;#39; mode and enabling the Sample Optimization option. If even possible, that poor player is likely not going to notice the reduction in texture filtering through a hastily encoded low resolution stream anyway, and it could reduce frame times a decent amount right? Why else would standalone titles have such weak anistrophic filtering, eh? See the Crimson guide if you really need to outfit a weak system: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/uwigp9\/crimsons_new_and_improved_guide_to_optimizing\/\"&gt;https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/uwigp9\/crimsons_new_and_improved_guide_to_optimizing\/&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Words:&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trying to find Morpheus through the staticky fog of wireless VR for a few years now. As others may attest, through the trials and tribulations of swapping out routers, updates, update bugs, experimental features, etc, it&amp;#39;s somewhat of a two steps forward, one step back situation, eh. I had Virtual Desktop before Airlink was a thing, but the latter seemed to work better on a crappy TP Link router, so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to use the solution many people were making earnest claims to being better for a long time. Then I got my Asus router (mwah) and switched to VD and couldn&amp;#39;t stop raving about it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then after about a year or so of updates (juicy ones) something either changed (I think it was sliced encoding) or my want for a more smooth experience jumped up a notch, and I couldn&amp;#39;t figure out how to iron out some pretty consistent problems with micro judder. I can reinstall VD right now, set it to low, use any of the codecs, jump down into the streets of MythOS city, wave my hands in front of my face all john cena like and get that horrible hitching. Again, I think it&amp;#39;s sliced encoding, which might now be only disable-able in some kind of registry option? Is it tracking stutter? With my airlink setup, I glide down the tube onto the pavement and flash gang signs to the dead null men without a hitch at a frame time so low I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I should be running this all at a higher resolution tick in the Oculus Home slider. I&amp;#39;m bustin.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VD has alot of convenience features I really enjoyed, for both the desktop, video playback, and vr streaming sides. You can notice the improvement in color banding when the added HEVC 10Bit, I will miss that. There are dozens upon dozens of (non game streaming) applications\/spam that aim to implement only some of what Virtual Desktop does. Were I to need to do lots of Cinema watching, or desktop work with my headset on (which I generally don&amp;#39;t but think it&amp;#39;s important) I would just use Virtual Desktop. Atm though, I&amp;#39;m back to Airlink, and it&amp;#39;s so smooth. I also tried the recent version of ALVR (just for fun) and they&amp;#39;re super far along in their progress, and it has lots of bells and whistles to play with.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;YMMV glhf&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/KB0yiXtGPkb0rXYtijIF42bZEc6TeMfPm0_itQj4Ct0.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0420d30462802f289fd4b37c915a1b2e65199e8f","width":840,"height":448},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/KB0yiXtGPkb0rXYtijIF42bZEc6TeMfPm0_itQj4Ct0.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7034a2f016fba9f9659a449848c3b3c087839a","width":108,"height":57},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/KB0yiXtGPkb0rXYtijIF42bZEc6TeMfPm0_itQj4Ct0.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9d9d6196428242044bb001e552c2513f266c450","width":216,"height":115},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/KB0yiXtGPkb0rXYtijIF42bZEc6TeMfPm0_itQj4Ct0.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c7e512ad68cce8e0e44e2d83720e4d2033409679","width":320,"height":170},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/KB0yiXtGPkb0rXYtijIF42bZEc6TeMfPm0_itQj4Ct0.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d56a3c0ddeacdaf8adf6a73d7e2d5f0885de80d5","width":640,"height":341}],"variants":{},"id":"MNkV5I6_N65n_drq9ISbXkabqAERcYkQT2aNuy7mIu0"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"160deym","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"byteframe","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/160deym\/an_airlink_works_better_for_me_than_virtual\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/160deym\/an_airlink_works_better_for_me_than_virtual\/","subreddit_subscribers":484106,"created_utc":1692909406.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"oculus","selftext":"It\u2019s an original Indo-French series with six episodes revolving around themes of human connections, virtual worlds, metaverse identities and secret corporations.

Unbeknownst to me, my headset had actually been undergoing a core software update, and restarting it corrupted to software, and there was nothing I could do. \n\nWhy was I not warned of an update beforehand?  Why was there no indicator of an update occuring, but rather the same identical loading screen that you get every time you boot up your headset?  That just doesn't seem very fair to me.\n\nTake an iPhone for example.  You're scrolling along, maybe answering texts, and a notification shows up stating that a brand new iOS update is available.  It gives you the option to either not update, update immediately, or update next time your device is off.  On top of that, when the update is occuring, there's the little bar below the white Apple logo that shows you that something is important is happening, and you should leave your phone be for a minute. \n\nNow imagine if Apple didn't do that, but instead just automatically updated your phone next time you turned it on.  What if instead of having the little loading bar, it just showed the generic Apple logo that is always shown for 10-15 minutes straight?  You would instinctively try to restart it.\n\nIf it was any other reason that my headset broke, I would blame myself, but how am I supposed to know when my headset is updating if it doesn't even warm me?  \n\nI got stuck with tech support for hours, and every single time, they ignore my complaint, and offer me OOW replacement as an \"act of kindness\".\n\nI refuse to believe I'm the only person who has been screwed over this way, as I know boot looping is a very prominent issue in the community.  Why hasn't Oculus done anything about it?","author_fullname":"t2_2vitqoye","gilded":0,"title":"The Boot Loop Problem Needs to be Fixed","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"green","thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","score":1,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"suggested_sort":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"b193c526-b043-11e3-bcb9-12313d21b86e","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"removed_by":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","link_flair_background_color":"","id":"15wia8v","is_robot_indexable":true,"author":"KrispyPoptart","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/15wia8v\/the_boot_loop_problem_needs_to_be_fixed\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/15wia8v\/the_boot_loop_problem_needs_to_be_fixed\/","subreddit_subscribers":483886,"created_utc":1692554626,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"retrieved_utc":1692554637,"updated_utc":1692554637,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-08-20 18:03:46"},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"oculus","selftext":"So for context, I bought a KKCOBVR quest 2 battery pack about half a year ago, and it was the greatest investment I ever made.

when i las used my quest.\n\nSome days ago when i tried to use it i had to update the quest and also the oculus pc app.\n\nWhen i try to connect on the quest (HMD) it i can see my pc under available pcs to connect to under air link. it says the name of my pc and under it \"Not connected\", the button says \"Pair\" and when i click it it turns dark blue and the text greyed out and says \"Launch\", nothing happens on pc, at this point guess i am supposed to get a pairing code, i guess, but nothing happens.\n\ntried to:\n\n* Restart PC\n* Restart HMD\n* Factory reset HMD\n* Reinstall Quest PC App\n* Again with the install app click the repair button\n* Tried the  C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Oculus\\\\Support\\\\oculus-drivers\n   * Nothing happens when i click that app,\n      * my mouse flashed for 1 sec as it were to open an app in the background\n   * Run it as administrator\n      * The same happens again, i guess s running it in the background\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Restart the router\n* Changed the router from the \"Smart Mode\" to normal so it doesn't chose which internet i get for my HMD (4 or 5g) and i only connected the HMD to 5g\n* Change the SSID and password (Pc through ethernet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tried to connect to my laptop (Which i could connect to before, i even played on the poor thing)\n   * On the Quest 2 under air link i can't even see my laptop, i only see the pc\n   * I know that the pc is not printed there like an error because when i shout it down i don't see it under available pc's in air link (Not even \"Not Connected\" \n   * Both laptop and pc are in search mode for a quest (When i click add a device or set up and click air link and give me the instructions to connect from the headset)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Deactivate Air Link restart oculus restart pc and activate air link again\n* Both are version 56.x.x.x.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Deactivated ESET Protection\n   * Deactivated ESET Firewall\n   * Gave ESET Permission through firewall (Idk if correctly but i tried)\n* Contacted support, when nothing happened gave them the log files, they are still looking in to it, we were talking by chat but they tried everything and now i am waiting for an answer by email but it seems that no hope...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I stuck with an unusable Quest 2? I usually play a lot of pc games and only have 2-3 apps on the quest itself.\n\nAlso, is there a way to see if the request from the quest to connect is even being sent to the pc? it seems like nothing happens when i click \"Pair\"\n\nIsn't there like a windows event viewer where i see that a request had come to my pc? And it was blocked by firewall or anything but just to see that it arrives to the pc. Can someone teach me how to read that in the mess that is event viewer?\n\nI am no engineer so idk what's going on around there i just see a bunch of application error and stuff.","author_fullname":"t2_3zlbl9h","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Air Link not Pairing","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_15iqbzi","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.71,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":3,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":3,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1691225227.0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1691224967.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see if anyone can come up with something to my problem.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have used air link for years since about 2 months ago when i las used my quest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some days ago when i tried to use it i had to update the quest and also the oculus pc app.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When i try to connect on the quest (HMD) it i can see my pc under available pcs to connect to under air link. it says the name of my pc and under it &amp;quot;Not connected&amp;quot;, the button says &amp;quot;Pair&amp;quot; and when i click it it turns dark blue and the text greyed out and says &amp;quot;Launch&amp;quot;, nothing happens on pc, at this point guess i am supposed to get a pairing code, i guess, but nothing happens.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;tried to:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Restart PC&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Restart HMD&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Factory reset HMD&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reinstall Quest PC App&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Again with the install app click the repair button&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tried the  C:\\Program Files\\Oculus\\Support\\oculus-drivers\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Nothing happens when i click that app,\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;my mouse flashed for 1 sec as it were to open an app in the background&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run it as administrator\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The same happens again, i guess s running it in the background&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Restart the router&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changed the router from the &amp;quot;Smart Mode&amp;quot; to normal so it doesn&amp;#39;t chose which internet i get for my HMD (4 or 5g) and i only connected the HMD to 5g&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Change the SSID and password (Pc through ethernet)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tried to connect to my laptop (Which i could connect to before, i even played on the poor thing)\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On the Quest 2 under air link i can&amp;#39;t even see my laptop, i only see the pc&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I know that the pc is not printed there like an error because when i shout it down i don&amp;#39;t see it under available pc&amp;#39;s in air link (Not even &amp;quot;Not Connected&amp;quot; &lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Both laptop and pc are in search mode for a quest (When i click add a device or set up and click air link and give me the instructions to connect from the headset)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deactivate Air Link restart oculus restart pc and activate air link again&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Both are version 56.x.x.x.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deactivated ESET Protection\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deactivated ESET Firewall&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gave ESET Permission through firewall (Idk if correctly but i tried)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contacted support, when nothing happened gave them the log files, they are still looking in to it, we were talking by chat but they tried everything and now i am waiting for an answer by email but it seems that no hope...&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Am I stuck with an unusable Quest 2?

After all, you can't copy and paste text from review in the Oculus app, so why wouldn't you create a link that is easy to remember?\n\nI spent like an hour going through every game I owned, creating a shortened referral URL, then adding it to my already existing reviews. This is before Meta started cracking down on URLs.\n\nSure enough, they flooded in. So many, in fact, that I accepted the max of $600 credit for the calendar year. The list of completed referrals that are ready to redeem is so long, it takes me over a minute to scroll through them scrolling as fast as I can. I counted, and I have over 3 years of maxed out credit, meaning next year I'll redeem the next $600, and in 2025, I'll be able to redeem the next $600. They still trickle in occasionally.\n\nThe negative side of this is, people will leave glowing reviews for games they aren't fond of, simply to convince the user to use their referral link. Let me be clear by saying I did not do this. I rate using the entire scale and only edited my existing reviews.\n\nAnyway, long story short, it's very nice to be able to buy something and not worry about getting too much time out of it. If I drop $30 credit on something, I'm happy to just get 3ish hours out of it, whereas with my own money, I'd want more than that.

Download 2.1.1 Version ([Support.zip](https:\/\/support.zip\/)): [https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1dprJ7QxIzyzb4jZC-H-fQ\\_sRzOVCFA62\/view](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1dprJ7QxIzyzb4jZC-H-fQ_sRzOVCFA62\/view)\n\n2.) Download Oculus Tray Tool: [https:\/\/www.guru3d.com\/files-details\/oculus-traytool-download.html](https:\/\/www.guru3d.com\/files-details\/oculus-traytool-download.html)\n\n3.) Install Oculus Tray Tool.\n\n4.) Open Oculus Tray Tool.\n\n5.) Click \"Service &amp; Startup\", and click the Blue Square to stop the Oculus Service.\n\n6.) Exit completely out of Oculus Tray Tool.\n\n7.) Open [Support.zip](https:\/\/support.zip\/). ( [https:\/\/imgur.com\/UFE0wE6](https:\/\/imgur.com\/UFE0wE6) If you have a hard time finding the big green download button )\n\n8.) Open \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Oculus\\\\\" (or your oculus install folder) in another File Explorer window.\n\n9.) Drag the three files inside the .zip into your Oculus folder. Overwrite them all if it asks.\n\n10.) Open the newly overwritten \"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Oculus\\\\Support\\\\oculus-drivers\".\n\n11.) Run oculus-driver.exe. (If any confirmation window popup, select yes)\n\n12.) Turn your internet OFF completely. No access to the internet at all.\n\n13.) Open Oculus Tray Tool again.\n\n14.) Click \"Service &amp; Startup\", and click the Sideways Blue Triangle to start the Oculus Service.(maybe they are running after driver installation,skip this point)\n\n15.) Open the Oculus App.\n\n16.) Click \"Update\" at the top of your Oculus window (Red Bar).\n\n17.) Reload Oculus.\n\n18.) If it asks you to update firmware again, do so.\n\n19.) Find notepad in your start menu, right click it, and hit \"Run as Administrator\"\n\n20.) File &gt; Open, then navigate to \"c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\drivers\\\\etc\\\\\"\n\n21.) Open \"hosts\"\n\n22.) At the bottom of the file add the following text: [127.0.0.1](https:\/\/127.0.0.1\/) [securecdn.oculus.com](https:\/\/securecdn.oculus.com\/)\n\n(So the bottom few lines will look like this:)\n\n\\# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.\n\n\\# 127.0.0.1localhost\n\n\\# ::1 localhost\n\n[127.0.0.1](https:\/\/127.0.0.1\/) [securecdn.oculus.com](https:\/\/securecdn.oculus.com\/)\n\n22.5.) Save the file.\n\n23.) Turn your internet back on.\n\n24.) Oculus may display an error about services unavailable, but this is ok!\n\n25.) Your client will still say v12, 12.1, or whatever you are on, but it's okay because the firmware is the thing that's broken.\n\n26.) To verify that the downgrade was successful, open Oculus, hit \"Devices\".\n\n27.) It will list each component, \"Rift S, Right Touch, and Left Touch\". Click the little mask icon next to \"Rift S\".\n\n28.) A side window will pop up and \"Software Version\" should say 2.1.1.\n\n**After updating all this.

At the bottom of the file add the following text: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/127.0.0.1\/\"&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/securecdn.oculus.com\/\"&gt;securecdn.oculus.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(So the bottom few lines will look like this:)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;# 127.0.0.1localhost&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;# ::1 localhost&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/127.0.0.1\/\"&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/securecdn.oculus.com\/\"&gt;securecdn.oculus.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;22.5.) Save the file.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;23.) Turn your internet back on.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;24.) Oculus may display an error about services unavailable, but this is ok!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;25.) Your client will still say v12, 12.1, or whatever you are on, but it&amp;#39;s okay because the firmware is the thing that&amp;#39;s broken.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;26.) To verify that the downgrade was successful, open Oculus, hit &amp;quot;Devices&amp;quot;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;27.) It will list each component, &amp;quot;Rift S, Right Touch, and Left Touch&amp;quot;. Click the little mask icon next to &amp;quot;Rift S&amp;quot;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28.) A side window will pop up and &amp;quot;Software Version&amp;quot; should say 2.1.1.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After updating all this. I then took out (deleted) the DNS Hosts block address from Hosts File, --&lt;\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/127.0.0.1\/\"&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;\/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/securecdn.oculus.com\/\"&gt;securecdn.oculus.com&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Copied my own files from a back up and over write these,&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Link from my Google Drive. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1VAhsNauDgIbUSBS9HmKjbcTUvCl-8ypm\/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1VAhsNauDgIbUSBS9HmKjbcTUvCl-8ypm\/view?usp=sharing&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over write this (unzip over write) to path C:\\Program Files\\Oculus\\Support&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update firmware to latest Version 53,&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Re add the line to end of hosts file save.
