But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.","author_fullname":"t2_a7mpw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Towers and Powers Review: VR's newest tower defense game","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"slategrey","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18sup93","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (YouTuber)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703772402.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM\"&gt;https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate it if you would give my video a watch, I give some pretty good examples in it to help give you an idea of what this game is like.

I wanted to get it for him for Christmas and there is a current deal on Amazon for the 128gb version for $250 plus a $50 Amazon gift card so basically $200. I know the quest 3 is out and the best but I'm definitely not spending $500+ right now since I doubt he will get full use out of it and he would prob get pissed if I spent that much on him haha. \n\nFor the record he has expressed interest in VR it and loves new tech and has specifically brought up getting a headset someday, however, I can't see him using it while standing up much as he would prob get dizzy and fall into the TV. He has some neuropathy in his feet which causes him to lose balance occasionally in real life so I'd imagine VR wouldn't help haha, but my folks are still pretty active.  It's getting hard for him to travel overseas at this point in his life and one of the main features he wants to experience are VR walking videos and a Google Earth VR types experience which I hear can be done pretty well through the Wander app and something else I read about today called Wooorld? But yeah I would assume most of his usage would be from his recliner. \n\nI see people saying to buy it used since it's old and the 3 is out but there's a 50% chance he doesn't like it or it can make him dizzy so I'd rather buy new and have a safer return policy. Also considering it's basically $200 new right now, used cant be much cheaper. \n\nSo a few questions...\n\nDoes anyone know how Amazon handles returns with Meta Quest? I know they're pretty great about 95% of products but not sure if he opens it tries it and doesn't like it if I can just return it. They have the same deal at Best Buy and target if that helps but I figure Amazon is the easiest and most reliable for returns.\n\nDoes anyone either have parents or grandparents or are actually older themselves in life that use this and really enjoy it? Like I said I can't see him using it outside of sitting on a recliner 90% of the time so I want to make sure it's usable sitting down. \n\nIs it super complicated? He is prob the most tech-savvy 80-year-old I know but he has his moments haha. Is he going to have to call me every time he uses it?\n\nOne concern I have regarding posts here is that people are saying Facebook might drop support for early next year. Does anyone have any info regarding that? I don't want to spend money on it only to find nothing new will be made for it in a few months. However, I doubt the Meta Quest 2 will drop in price significantly any time soon.\n\nHow does it handle multiple accounts? Like we all have Facebook accounts, can I sign in under mine and use it, and then he signs in under his and uses it? How does all that work? If I ordered it for him for Christmas and got it early, could I and should I open it up myself to set things up and load on some games and apps before giving it to him so he can use it more out of the box on Christmas day, or will that screw things up since it would be on my account and not his?\n\nHow does it work with TV? I'm pretty sure it can mirror the image onto the TV so others can see but is that a wired-only thing or can the display be casted somehow? They have a brand new TV in one room but an old old TV in the living room where they usually are. Having to plug the headset into HDMI or anything would be a big hassle but would be cool for my mom to be able to see. \n\nLastly, Any advice tips, or suggestions for apps or games that older people could enjoy without having to stand much? Just cool experiences and visuals and whatnot. I'd love for him to play games as well but I'm not sure how much he can do from a recliner. He definitely wants to explore the world, but he definitely has a few issues with heights so I'm not trying to have him walk a plank over a city as much. \n\nAny other tips or help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nHappy Holidays!","author_fullname":"t2_e1bap","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Meta Quest 2 worth it for elderly parents at current deal?

When I ran them, the refresh rate would be very slow, and if I turned too quickly, I would see a black wall at the end of the image. If I played them too long, they would run slower until I had to restart my PC.

I've also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I've updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.\n\nIt's been a very long time since I've updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can't quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I've decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I'll only go into the main ones here.\n\n# OpenXR Update\n\n**Core SDK is now OpenXR**\n\nSo if you follow any VR news you'll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR. I've removed these and replaced them with the OpenXR system.\n\n**Advantages of OpenXR**\n\nOpenXR is in constant development with improvements that will carry down to all headsets.\n\nYou will be able to use your headset with the VR front you desire. OpenXR is fully compatible with SteamVR, Oculus Store and Windows Mixed Reality Portal. This means when using Whirligig from Steam you are not forced to use SteamVR. With direct support from each platform any performance improvements those platforms use will be filtered down into Whirligig.\n\nOpenXR implementation has meant I've removed the input options for both Oculus and Steam replacing it with a universal controller and some core controllers to use. You could select different controller skins when using Oculus. Now this feature is available on all setups.\n\nQuicker updates to other platforms. As all builds have been brought under one sdk I can now release the same version on different platforms with little change to the code. This will help to reduce bugs being introduced into other versions when updating and help my confidence that when I update I won't be breaking everyone's experience.\n\nI can develop for both PC and Mobile headsets at the same time.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n\nOpenXR is new and in constant flux. For development this is both advantages and crippling as currently every update to the SDK can cause issues in multiple ways. This will improve greatly over time but currently it's making supporting some headsets (mostly mobile headsets) quite difficult.\n\nSome features aren't working. Basically the UserPresent (what happens when the headset is put on or removed) feature isn't working properly. I will be implementing this back in once it's back up and running.\n\n# VLC VideoLan plugin update\n\nWhirligig offers 4 video path options to allow for the largest range of compatibility, Media Foundation, WinRT, Directshow and VideoLan. Media Foundation, WinRT and Directshow are available using the AVPro Renderheads plugin which is well supported by the developers, however the plugin that ran the VLC VideoLan support was no longer supported I have replaced the old plugin with an official VLC Video plugin made by the VideoLan guys themselves. This is much better supported and provides a host of improvements over the previous plugin.\n\n**VLC VideoLan integration improvements**\n\n* Greatly improved performance when using VLC video path (GPU decoding).\n* Using the latest VLC dlls, which provides the widest and most up to date media support.\n* Extra image support. Whirligig now supports xcf, gif, tiff, tif, ilbm, pcx, tga, bmp, pnm, webp, bpg, jpeg, jpg, jps, png, pns image formats. If there are any file types that I've not included but VLC does let me know and I'll add it to the list.\n\n# Future use of the VLC plugin\n\nThe official VLC plugin supports all the same features that the VLC player has, which allows me to open up other areas of support. The biggest one will be playback of streaming media from external locations. This will be more significant for mobile Whirligig as network playback support is often requested. There are several other additions I wish to look into but if anyone else has any ideas let me know.\n\n# Explorer improvements\n\nThe explorer in Whirligig has been functional but has needed updating for a while. I've redesigned a good part of it, worked on optimisations and fixed any bugs I've come across.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Explorer text based ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=675c0a9ceefba25524aed3da0dbe307fb48dec31)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ explorer visual explorer ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6249495f5724bf987d0acfa8ce3c7d9e1e4abff)\n\n# Audio reactive backgrounds\n\nAs I am using media playback systems that also support audio I've worked on adding audio reactive backgrounds to the player. When playing audio if you select one of these backgrounds, the environment will move and pulse to the audio as it plays. The audio backgrounds are 3D 360 environments and there are currently 7 to choose from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ Audio backgrounds ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368ef53b9f67b608fe01abdc9646fd907f8bbaad)\n\nCurrently it only works with Media Foundation and WinRT video paths for playing back audio.\n\n# Optimisation\n\nA significant amount of my time has been put into optimisation of code, especially in the input detection system I've created. Whirligig should now be snappier and feel smoother.\n\n# Engine and plugin updates\n\nWith VR being in constant development, keeping everything up to date is a must to ensure compatibility and gain performance improvements from the latest OpenXR versions. This version of Whirligig is currently running on Unity 2022.3.13f1 (as of release the latest 2022 version) and OpenXR 1.9.1.\n\n# Bug fixes\n\nI've continued to fix reported bugs and any bugs I've come across as I go along. With the major updates that I've been making there is always a chance I've broken things so any reports on issues are very welcome.\n\n# Additional Releases\n\nWhirligig is available on multiple platforms and multiple headsets and this release is going to signify an update release on all of the platforms bringing every version in line with each other.\n\nWhen it comes to betas I mostly release these on Steam so for beta versions Steam is the place to go. Sadly there isn't a universal store for Standalone VR yet so I've provided Ich.io for sideloading on some headsets and will be adding Whirligig to each of the manufactures stores if I can be accepted onto them.\n\nI've always held a policy that if you own Whirligig on any other platform you can request a code of another platform for free. Here is a list of the current platforms Whirligig is on\n\n**PC VR**\n\n* Steam Store\n* Oculus Store\n* Viveport\n* Pimax Store\n\n**Mobile VR**\n\n* Applabs (Quest 2\/3)\n* Ich.io (Quest 2\/3, Oculus Go, Pico)\n* Pimax Store (Pimax Crystal)\n\nIf you have Whirligig on any of these stores and wish to access one of the other stores email me [phileday@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:phileday@yahoo.co.uk) with proof of purchase (Screenshot of it in your library or something like that) and I'll send you a code for the store you wish.\n\nHopefully all the updates I've been making will improve the ability for me to support more headsets so keep an eye out for new headset support in the future.\n\n# Your feedback\n\nI am very happy to get feedback from the people who use Whirligig and most fixes and new features come from suggestions from all of you. If you have any suggestions or issues please let me know (comment here or post in the forum) and I'll do my best to implement and fix things. I want to continue to develop Whirligig into the foreseeable future so ways I can improve it for your needs the better.\n\n# User reviews\n\nOne of the reasons I've not updated on the Oculus Store in so long is because of the chances of getting bad reviews. I'm aware I've made very large improvements and changes over the last default release but here is where the issue lies. Because it's such a big jump it can really frustrate people who were expecting to load Whirligig in the same way as before and are presented with an update. This normally throws out a few bad reviews off the bat.\n\nSo I'm just asking that if you like the update and you're happy with Whirligig please review it. If you don't a negative review is fine however please be constructive so I can address any problems you have.\n\nPositive reviews really do matter to me as it tells me that I'm continuing to improve things and make a good product. This is also true for negative feedback when it is constructive as it allows me to address the issues that are brought up. If you do write a review whether it's negative or positive I'll do my best to address any issues or improve Whirligig as best as I can. I look forward to your feedback :)\n\n# And finally\n\nI'd just like to thank everyone who has supported this project (just by purchasing you're supporting and positive reviews are always welcome). Without the community who has commented, made suggestions and reported bugs I wouldn't of continued to develop Whirligig. This is all very appreciated.\n\nI hope you like the new update and I wish everyone happiness for the future. Keep watching :)\n\nPhil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_p6s1i","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Whirligig VR media player update with some major additions","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"slategrey","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":108,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"media_metadata":{"0xxs9qk9hc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=541cc0645205240670e8c735f3604d6fb4b4bb3a"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aa5620098cdd4d558cd72be5e91413581367a95"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e7dc6bd261e42a7c1026d8313c2eb96fe17a3bd"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fc0abd1e34c3690776fd79351a3ab7c62d8025f"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a95dc5ed97aba42a4a5be88a5dac9a435017aa5d"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95ac3d1e6e697b3a4a5c8e8c5cac05a9a1049003"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0xxs9qk9hc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=675c0a9ceefba25524aed3da0dbe307fb48dec31"},"id":"0xxs9qk9hc2c1"},"4fy4bcrbhc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":83,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2672b40f6c6e05eeb716067f1fc6ca3b2358bc76"},{"y":166,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500caf8a95f99c4e69d33e93b89dd76b6d9b0e6b"},{"y":247,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6933c8a6402552ba4a5b0b97049a0f7bdb05f7e5"},{"y":494,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b271957e90c29b52d7779fc449ad3579c3ab59a4"},{"y":741,"x":960,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37345e563d5a94a8a6dd510c30273244eb05c651"},{"y":833,"x":1080,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0771c69e76c590f028b17cf983203b7fd66ed2ba"}],"s":{"y":921,"x":1193,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4fy4bcrbhc2c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6249495f5724bf987d0acfa8ce3c7d9e1e4abff"},"id":"4fy4bcrbhc2c1"},"s8uzrildhc2c1":{"status":"valid","e":"Image","m":"image\/png","p":[{"y":86,"x":108,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=31c24fe694c324e031003f0b65b922048e0dbff3"},{"y":173,"x":216,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=753c3a7dc12ced28011b19d59941e3d791d677a4"},{"y":256,"x":320,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=abb3fe20a2e2a3aba88fdc5bd7b1343a6cf9f5b3"},{"y":512,"x":640,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f7e340b270567e8786db4b68f4a2cb56838dd01"}],"s":{"y":670,"x":836,"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s8uzrildhc2c1.png?width=836&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=368ef53b9f67b608fe01abdc9646fd907f8bbaad"},"id":"s8uzrildhc2c1"}},"name":"t3_182zkhx","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":140,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/QQEHJKcXpuBNm6K-7MHTbNzHHnG3xFlvKK6bpzrFEDY.jpg","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700853118.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly before I go on, I recreated this post from the news update I did on Steam as I updated the steam default build first. I&amp;#39;ve also added to it to draw context to the default update on the Oculus store. This is because Steam has a good feedback system so I can iron out any major bugs before the release here. Well now I&amp;#39;ve updated the Steam default, the Oculus and applabs versions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a very long time since I&amp;#39;ve updated the Oculus Store build. I find it the most scary one to do as I can&amp;#39;t quite address the feedback as efficiently than when I update on Steam. But you have to take the dive at some point and I&amp;#39;ve decided now. This does mean there are many many updates that have appeared since the last Oculus Store release but I&amp;#39;ll only go into the main ones here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;OpenXR Update&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Core SDK is now OpenXR&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you follow any VR news you&amp;#39;ll know that OpenXR is a big deal and will help to ease development for porting, new headsets being compatible out of the box and overall improving the VR experience. Whirligig up until now has had two SDK implementations, Oculus and SteamVR. I&amp;#39;ve removed these and replaced them with the OpenXR system.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of OpenXR&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR is in constant development with improvements that will carry down to all headsets.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will be able to use your headset with the VR front you desire. OpenXR is fully compatible with SteamVR, Oculus Store and Windows Mixed Reality Portal. This means when using Whirligig from Steam you are not forced to use SteamVR. With direct support from each platform any performance improvements those platforms use will be filtered down into Whirligig.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR implementation has meant I&amp;#39;ve removed the input options for both Oculus and Steam replacing it with a universal controller and some core controllers to use. You could select different controller skins when using Oculus. Now this feature is available on all setups.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Quicker updates to other platforms. As all builds have been brought under one sdk I can now release the same version on different platforms with little change to the code. This will help to reduce bugs being introduced into other versions when updating and help my confidence that when I update I won&amp;#39;t be breaking everyone&amp;#39;s experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can develop for both PC and Mobile headsets at the same time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OpenXR is new and in constant flux. For development this is both advantages and crippling as currently every update to the SDK can cause issues in multiple ways. This will improve greatly over time but currently it&amp;#39;s making supporting some headsets (mostly mobile headsets) quite difficult.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some features aren&amp;#39;t working. Basically the UserPresent (what happens when the headset is put on or removed) feature isn&amp;#39;t working properly. I will be implementing this back in once it&amp;#39;s back up and running.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;VLC VideoLan plugin update&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whirligig offers 4 video path options to allow for the largest range of compatibility, Media Foundation, WinRT, Directshow and VideoLan. Media Foundation, WinRT and Directshow are available using the AVPro Renderheads plugin which is well supported by the developers, however the plugin that ran the VLC VideoLan support was no longer supported I have replaced the old plugin with an official VLC Video plugin made by the VideoLan guys themselves. This is much better supported and provides a host of improvements over the previous plugin.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VLC VideoLan integration improvements&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Greatly improved performance when using VLC video path (GPU decoding).&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using the latest VLC dlls, which provides the widest and most up to date media support.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Extra image support.

I've heard about Blood Trail and Bone Labs as some violent VR titles that I can enjoy. And I also want to play older games again via EmuVr.\n\nBut when I say I'm a first time Quest owner... I'm more or less a new owner of a modern console, in general. The last console I've had is a N64, and even before that, it's been years since I've played and owned a PS4.\n\nI don't have, or ever had, a Steam account. I don't have a Quest account set up (yet), and all these things about \"having a virtual desktop\" and \"linq cable\" are pretty much throwing me off.

Will I be able to use the passthrough while streaming my headset live to Discord, while also doing things like watching youtube or listening to spotify.\n2. Will I be able to watch movies\/shows\/etc in a VR setting while also streaming and talking on discord.\n3. Am I able to use my own headset\/ear buds\/IEMs?\n4. Am I able to use my own microphone? (Via usb\/bluetooth\/3.5\/etc)\n5. I have a fairly solid PC, as well as a laptop... is there anyway to allow my PC\/Laptop to handle any of the processing load while also keeping the headset wireless? Would there be much benefit in this for the types of things I am interested in?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance for anybody willing to answer any of these questions!","author_fullname":"t2_hfcob","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Interested in Quest 3, have a few general questions...","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17sx8ue","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1699717976.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve always been interested in VR Headsets, but never really made the leap to purchase one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#39;m particularly tempted to pick up a Quest 3, and just wanted to make sure I&amp;#39;ll be able to do the kinds of things I&amp;#39;m interested in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, I&amp;#39;m pretty much interested in the Passthrough\/Mixed Reality, and also just being more connected socially via VR with friends.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I did have a handful of questions I would love to run by you guys for anybody who is willing to answer :D&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Will I be able to use the passthrough while streaming my headset live to Discord, while also doing things like watching youtube or listening to spotify.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Will I be able to watch movies\/shows\/etc in a VR setting while also streaming and talking on discord.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Am I able to use my own headset\/ear buds\/IEMs?&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Am I able to use my own microphone?

I am a wabbajack author with over 10,000 unique downloads on Nexus for:\n\nSkyrim VR Ultra Modded - [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YQ\\_Kfuv07dQ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YQ_Kfuv07dQ)\n\nFallout 4 VR Ultra Modded - [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kLgZ-IKHPFQ](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kLgZ-IKHPFQ)\n\n**TLDR - If you have a Quest 2, just buy this now, it is the equivalent of upgrading your 3080\/90 to 4090.**\n\n**Screen and FOV**\n\nWhy do we upgrade GPU's? Quite simply, to run our device at higher and higher resolutions. The ultra modded modlists I pasted above, can technically be played on 1070 if you lower the headset to potato resolution in Virtual Desktop. And why do we want to run at higher resolutions? It is for image clarity, not more visual effects.\n\nUpgrading to pancake lenses alone, is the equivalent of going from Virtual Desktop medium to Virtual Desktop ultra. Virtual Desktop ultra is actually wasted on Quest 2, as it is quite a bit more than the 150% device resolution needed to handle barrel distortion. I can confidently say Quest 3 with Virtual Desktop medium, looks as good, if not better than Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop ultra. Quest 3 with Virtual Desktop ultra, is absolutely gorgeous. You notice all the little details you didn't before, and it is far more forgiving on viewing angle so when you pass it around at a party you don't need to spend a lot of time adjusting it for kids.\n\nBecause Virtual Desktop normalizes resolutions, Virtual Desktop ultra is about as many pixels on Quest 3 as on Quest 2, it DOES NOT require 30% more GPU power UNLESS you use the godlike resolution, which is too much for my 3090 and ultra modded games.\n\nThe increased CPU\/GPU from Quest 3 is very noticeable. I don't have a true Wifi 6e router, just a trusty Asus AX86U, but even then, 200 MBPS HEVC looked really solid, I can tell Quest 2 couldn't quite handle this level of encoding before, now there is far more headroom, resulting in lower latency and less compression artifacts. If you have a 40x0 that supports AV1, and Wifi 6E router, wired VR is obsolete.\n\nFOV upgrade is a nice bump, not night and day, but a noticeable difference especially if you go back to a Quest 2 right after. I have never tried Pico 4 or Quest Pro before, given they are already pancake lenses, I would say don't bother until you are REALLY into mixed reality stuff. However if you only have a Quest 2, this is the no brainer choice with most upside from future software support.\n\nConsider your Quest 2 can probably still be sold for $150, the trust cost of upgrade is $350, far cheaper than going from 3080\/90 to 4090!\n\n**Comfort**\n\nThe headset like many reviewers said is better balanced so it feels lighter than it weighs. I absolutely can not stand adjusting rope straps so I bought a cheap ZyberVR from Amazon which does the job: [https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CHPDYLW1](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CHPDYLW1) The default face cover is much better than previous ones, when pushed all the way in it gives you a very nice FOV boost, comparable to thin VR cover.

I am a wabbajack author with over 10,000 unique downloads on Nexus for:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skyrim VR Ultra Modded - &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YQ_Kfuv07dQ\"&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YQ_Kfuv07dQ&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fallout 4 VR Ultra Modded - &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kLgZ-IKHPFQ\"&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kLgZ-IKHPFQ&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR - If you have a Quest 2, just buy this now, it is the equivalent of upgrading your 3080\/90 to 4090.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Screen and FOV&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why do we upgrade GPU&amp;#39;s? Quite simply, to run our device at higher and higher resolutions. The ultra modded modlists I pasted above, can technically be played on 1070 if you lower the headset to potato resolution in Virtual Desktop. And why do we want to run at higher resolutions? It is for image clarity, not more visual effects.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Upgrading to pancake lenses alone, is the equivalent of going from Virtual Desktop medium to Virtual Desktop ultra. Virtual Desktop ultra is actually wasted on Quest 2, as it is quite a bit more than the 150% device resolution needed to handle barrel distortion. I can confidently say Quest 3 with Virtual Desktop medium, looks as good, if not better than Quest 2 with Virtual Desktop ultra. Quest 3 with Virtual Desktop ultra, is absolutely gorgeous. You notice all the little details you didn&amp;#39;t before, and it is far more forgiving on viewing angle so when you pass it around at a party you don&amp;#39;t need to spend a lot of time adjusting it for kids.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because Virtual Desktop normalizes resolutions, Virtual Desktop ultra is about as many pixels on Quest 3 as on Quest 2, it DOES NOT require 30% more GPU power UNLESS you use the godlike resolution, which is too much for my 3090 and ultra modded games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The increased CPU\/GPU from Quest 3 is very noticeable. I don&amp;#39;t have a true Wifi 6e router, just a trusty Asus AX86U, but even then, 200 MBPS HEVC looked really solid, I can tell Quest 2 couldn&amp;#39;t quite handle this level of encoding before, now there is far more headroom, resulting in lower latency and less compression artifacts. If you have a 40x0 that supports AV1, and Wifi 6E router, wired VR is obsolete.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FOV upgrade is a nice bump, not night and day, but a noticeable difference especially if you go back to a Quest 2 right after. I have never tried Pico 4 or Quest Pro before, given they are already pancake lenses, I would say don&amp;#39;t bother until you are REALLY into mixed reality stuff. However if you only have a Quest 2, this is the no brainer choice with most upside from future software support.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Consider your Quest 2 can probably still be sold for $150, the trust cost of upgrade is $350, far cheaper than going from 3080\/90 to 4090!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The headset like many reviewers said is better balanced so it feels lighter than it weighs. I absolutely can not stand adjusting rope straps so I bought a cheap ZyberVR from Amazon which does the job: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CHPDYLW1\"&gt;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CHPDYLW1&lt;\/a&gt; The default face cover is much better than previous ones, when pushed all the way in it gives you a very nice FOV boost, comparable to thin VR cover. When fully extended it leaves good room for glasses but I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy using it that way until I got Zanni&amp;#39;s. The FOV is really bad when you wear glasses and fully extend that thing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed Reality&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PCVR failed to make VR relevant, so I actually do believe Meta, and especially Apple&amp;#39;s take in mixed reality is the right direction.

If you have a tonne of disposable income and can afford the 512GB model without even thinking about it, this post isn't for you. If you're someone who has to save and pinch pennies to afford it, because you think you need the highest end model, read on for a few reasons why you might not actually need it.\n\nReason 1) The 512GB model of the Quest 3 is a joke. I'm Australian, so all prices are in Australian dollars but the general idea should translate. The 128GB Quest 3 is $799 while the 512GB model is $1049. That's a difference of $250 for 384GB. For reference, here are some NVME SSDs that cost less than $250 here in the land down under (prices are from au.pcpartpicker.com)\n\n- 2TB Samsung 980 Pro - $239\n- 2TB Crucial P5 Plus - $199\n- 2TB WD Black SN770 - $227.95\n\nSo the 512GB model is a scam, the more who buy into it the more Meta will do it, because it'll just show them that people are happy to get scammed. Don't get me wrong, the 128GB base model isn't any less of a scam, but I'll get to why it's enough for most users next.\n\nReason 2) Quest games are mobile games. They're small. Even Asgard's Wrath 2, potentially the biggest game to come to the Quest platform yet, is [currently reported to have an install size of 21GB](https:\/\/mixed-news.com\/en\/a-side-effect-of-aaa-gaming-quest-3-storage-tips\/). Games from the Quest 2 generation were also quite small, these are sizes from the Quest store:\n\n* Contractors - 9.6GB\n* Resident Evil 4 - 8.15\n* The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners - 6.8GB\n* Blade and Sorcery Nomad - 2.35GB\n* Into the Radius - 4.34GB\n* Pistol Whip - 1.59\n* Beat Saber - 1.45\n* Bonelab - 6.64\n\nThe trend goes on, and while the Quest 3 does enable higher fidelity graphics which could inflate install sizes, it's still manageable through...\n\nReason 3) Smart storage management. Basically, if you're playing a single player story driven game like Asgard's Wrath 2 and you've fully exhausted the content available, uninstall it. Obviously I'm privileged to live in a city, in a country where unlimited internet plans are the norm, so if you have restrictions on bandwidth this may not be something you want to do. However, for anyone who can do it, cleaning out large games that you've completed or don't play anymore is an easy way to save space. If you're the type of person who watches a lot of movies or 8k BaDoinkVR videos then maybe try this next thing...\n\nReason 4) Media shares and servers. If you're relaxing at home and want to enjoy the fine minutiae of an 8k BaDoinkVR video you may or may not have obtained through dubious means, for the love of God please don't store it on your headset. Media can be a massive space hog for any device, so I'd encourage everyone to do the bare minimum of using their PC or laptop to host a media server using Plex or Jellyfin or Emby. You can find tonnes of resources online to help you set one up. You don't need to go out and buy enterprise server equipment, if you have a laptop or a desktop you can likely use that to start with. If you have an old, unused laptop lying around you can even convert that into a 24\/7 NAS. This is great for enjoying your porn at home, how to enjoy it while travelling though? \n\nReason 5) Travel routers and or wireless hard drives. You can plug a hard drive into a travel router and it will create a wireless network for you to jack into, this is still probably cheaper than buying the higher end Quest 3 model by the way. Let me check... So for the router we have a TP-Link AC750 Wireless Travel Router for $50, and for storage we have a 2TB Seagate Expansion Portable hard drive for $98. So $148 which is still $100 less than buying the 512GB model of the Quest 3. Now, this router is probably not beefy enough to run a Plex media server, but it can host a network drive that you can access using the Quest 3, combining that with a viewer like Pigasus, you've got a portable, congratulations.\n\nAnyway, I've said my piece. Please don't buy a 512GB Quest 3. This is an unacceptable trend in tech with every phone, laptop and device manufacturer overpricing storage. Buying the base model Quest 3 still makes us complicit in it, but we don't want to deprive ourselves of cool new tech. We can however show we aren't willing to pay such a hefty premium for a measly 384GB when NAND prices are so low. The manufacturing price difference between the 128GB model and the 512GB model is likely measured in pennies, so don't overpay.","author_fullname":"t2_i3m80xkx6","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"You don't need 512GB (unless you do)","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"green","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_172forw","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":null,"upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1696709640.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of comments or posts about the new Quest 3 with people lamenting on the cost of the end 512GB model as if it is the only viable choice.

keeping track of all the VR games I\u2019ve played this year to catalogue them in hopes that they may give fellow VR gamers some fresh games to try out, or reasons to revisit older games that have had big updates. I'm currently up to 73 different VR games played this year. The first 22 that I played from January to March can be found [here](https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/there-are-no-games-to-play-january-march-2023-edition\/) and the 30 games I played from April to May are [here](https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/quick-thoughts-on-30-different-vr-games\/).\n\nSome of the games listed below, I can see playing all year long, others are not my cup of tea, but they may interest you enough to try them out. In either case, here are my quick thoughts on the 21 games I played during from June through August 2023.\n\n*TLDR: My top 5 games to check out from this list are at the bottom and so is some info for a game giveaway.*\n\n**1. Espire 2**$29.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/3529713943716002\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** More of the same, but with a few more fun gadgets to play with.\n\n***From the store:*** Experience unparalleled stealth action in two unique story campaigns with Espire 2, a full-fledged VR first person shooter on Meta Quest 2!  After intel from an anonymous whistleblower reveals the terrorist cell OPHIS\u2019 plot for global domination, Espire Operative Poe once again finds themselves at the center of the Espire program. With the entire world hanging in the balance, it\u2019s up to Poe and their Espire frames  to dismantle OPHIS from the inside.\n\n***My thoughts:*** A solid second entry. If you enjoyed the first, you\u2019ll like the second. Fun gunplay, stealth and new ideas to try here. Worth a pickup if you want a solid VR experience. The story is just okay though, and follows the first. I did run into some tricky spots with movement and figuring out where to go, but not enough to sour the experience. Worth a buy.\n\n**2. We Are One**$19.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4052099231581371) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1669500\/We_Are_One\/) \/ [Demo](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4089073041145597\/) (free)\n\n***My quick take:*** If you like score chasing and The Last Clockwinder, give this a go.\n\n***From the store:*** Team up with your greatest ally - YOURSELF - in this VR puzzle shooter where mind-bending challenges meet action-packed FPS gameplay! Plan ahead and clone versions of yourself that flawlessly execute your previous moves in multiple time loops. Battle your way across increasingly complex levels set against the backdrop of a vibrant, hand drawn VR world.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I played this one back on the App Lab days and was so excited to finally see it come to the full store. It met all my high-score chasing expectations. The gunplay, movement, story and progression are so fine tuned and dialed in that when you make a mistake, you know it was on you. It has a unique gameplay mechanic similar to The Last Clockwinder that is both intuitive and quite special. If you just go through the game straight through, you\u2019ll finish in a couple hours and have a fun time, if you stick around for some high-score chasing, you\u2019ll find many more hours of precision gameplay ahead of you. One of my favorites this year. A true gem in the store.\n\n**3. Shuttle Maze**$11.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4055335517833878\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A neat maze adventure with a cute story.\n\n***From the store:*** Step into a retro 80s arcade-inspired game with Shuttle Maze proudly made by Ayayu Games! The year is 2062 and Glow is trapped by Maze Phreak - a crazy AI, gone wild. Help Glow, the renegade space racing pilot, to get her license back by finding the famous genius AI-computer-scientist, Dr. Harris. Featuring a rich story line with animated cutscenes and phenomenal voice acting, Shuttle Maze feels like a rich blend of 80s retro arcade and watching your favorite Saturday morning cartoon.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I only played the game trial for 15 minutes and got to experience the first level. While I enjoyed the graphics and what I saw of the story, I didn\u2019t feel compelled to buy the full game. I\u2019m sure there was plenty more to experience, but escaping a maze and its traps just did not pull me in. Try out the demo for sure to see if you may enjoy it.\n\n**4. Coffee Shop Simulator VR**$14.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5905492699487778\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** If you want to be a barista and run your own store, you\u2019ll have to put up with a bunch of jank first.\n\n***From the store:*** Become a Coffee Shop owner with Coffee Shop Simulator VR! Start small with easy recipes and extend your business by ordering more ingredients and light food end expanding the shop building. Never forget to pay the bills for the shop! Be a world class level barista and a great owner but never be afraid of other small jobs in the coffee shop. Follow the recipes to serve well-known coffee drinks or add your own touch but remember, the customers satisfaction is all about a great coffee taste! Enjoy one of the best graphics on Quest!\n\n***My thoughts:*** Still rough around the edges despite having seen some updates. I enjoy simulation games and there\u2019s a lot to do here, place orders for food, coffee and ingredients, create a variety of drinks and deliver them in a timely manner. The issue is there is just a lot of jank still, and maybe in six months this one could be a solid experience, as for now, it\u2019s just a bit too rough to recommend.\n\n**5. Ghosts of Tabor**$19.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/7614022262006379\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957780\/Ghosts_of_Tabor\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** For a game still in beta, this one really shines.\n\n***From the store:*** Ghosts of Tabor is the only extraction based VR FPS PVP and PVE survival game where you will have to use your wits, skills and resources to survive. Inspired by games such as Escape from Tarkov and Day Z, the game features a variety of scenarios from scavenging, looting to crafting. Make your safehouse your own by building your personal collection weapons and gear to display in your armory.\n\n***My thoughts:*** There has been a ton of buzz around the survival game Ghosts of Tabor, and rightfully so. With the lead of the game focusing on hyper realism with gunplay, ammo types and gear, I highly recommend jumping in with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing to show you the ropes. The tutorial (when I played it), lacked quite a bit of the details, and when I went in solo for my first game, I was quite lost. A few games later after playing with some people from the Tabor community, I had my feet under me. With the game still in beta, lots of testing, full game wipes and changes are happening, but they seem to be listening to their community and doing a great job. Pick this up if you\u2019re into games like Escape from Tarkov and DayZ.\n\n**6. Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Hung Parliament**$11.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4624529214241452\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A fun collaborative who-done-it, but with some technical issues.\n\n***From the store:*** Don your deerstalker and step into the shoes of the world\u2019s most famous sleuth in this gripping live-action 1-4 player point-and-click mystery detective adventure. With three cabinet members already murdered by hanging and Sherlock Holmes missing in action, it is up to you to find the killer before Big Ben strikes midnight. Interrogate suspects, analyze crime scenes, collect evidence, and enter your \u2018Mind Palace\u2019 to construct a compelling case in this \u2018Whodunit\u2019 that will push your deduction skills to their limits. Play alone or with friends to make this a social sleuthing experience you will never forget.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I played with three other people and right away the game stated that the multiplayer was still in beta. Well, that was true because only two of the four people could see the story playing out at times, and missed some audio in other parts. It was a neat time being in different real-life 360 degree scanned rooms all looking for clues before the timer runs out. There were lively discussions within our group as to who did the crime. All that being said, we had to take a vote who we thought did the crime and ended up getting it wrong. An acceptable outcome, but none of us have revisited it to try again as everything was time locked and you had to spend a certain amount of time in each room and couldn\u2019t skip through if you had already played it once. A mixed bag, but a decent night with friends for the cost.\n\n**7. Moss: Book II**$19.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4395292760584049\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2059670\/Moss_Book_II\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** New worlds and gameplay all wrapped in a familiar, yet fresh approach.\n\n***From the store:*** Quill is back\u2014and she\u2019s being hunted. Those who seek to unmake this world are desperate for the Glass she holds, and they\u2019ll stop at nothing to claw it from her grasp. But the young hero has a plan of her own, one that could finally end the merciless rule of the Arcane and restore peace to Moss once more. To stand a chance, Quill will need a true partner by her side\u2014and we hope that partner is you. With her, you\u2019ll venture deep inside the hexed castle of the Arcane where dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel await.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I quite enjoyed the first Moss game and finally played the second. I recommend you play the first if you haven\u2019t, as this picks up right after the first one ends. It\u2019s a lot of the same platforming, action and puzzling as the first, but there is a unique twist which I quite enjoyed and will not spoil here. The scenery and sense of traversal across the world is spectacular and the levels are a real treat. While the swordplay and puzzles aren\u2019t always the most exciting, it\u2019s still a grand time. If you haven\u2019t played this series, or this game yet, it\u2019s one of the best VR experiences and series on the Quest.\n\n**8. BallisticVR**$9.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5814904788638794\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A sometimes frustrating puzzle game where every minute adjustment matters.\n\n***From the store:*** It's a puzzle game where you start by taking a tutorial to teach you how to use the input system to control the missiles before launch them to hit the targets. The directions that the player inputs is relative to the missile's axis all the time and the player can hit the targets with so many variations of inputs.\n\n***My thoughts:*** This looked like an interesting puzzle game to plan out your route, get your coordinates dialed in and fine tune each movement. The bones of a solid game are here but I think there are some real opportunities for quality of life updates that hold this back. Dials should interact differently, and more options for comfort and movement need to be added as well. All that being said, if you want to think, tinker and play a solo game, each level takes a good amount of time and lots of trial and error.\n\n**9. Task Force 9 Demo**Free [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/7182152818468130\/?utm_source=sidequest)\n\n***My quick take:*** An ambitious game, but just too rough around the edges.\n\n***From the store:*** Task Force 9 is a cutthroat VR game where players must ruthlessly take out enemies using any means necessary, whether it be through brute force or sneaky tactics. You'll have to strategically maneuver your AI partner while relying on cover, explosives, rappelling, wall breaching, and ambushes to gain the upper hand. This game is not for the faint of heart, as it it not just one more tactical shooter but we aims to sharpen your instincts in the brutal world of close-quarters combat. Are you ready to put your skills to the test?\n\n***My thoughts:*** This is an ambitious game that has a Breachers single player feel, but without any of the polish. It may get there, but I found myself flailing around struggling to get things to work. My AI partner got stuck and the controls just didn\u2019t feel intuitive. Might be worth checking back in to see how it has progressed in a few months.\n\n**10. Escape Room Online**$1.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/9023860981020066\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A $1.99 co-op horror escape room that is absolutely worth the price of admission.\n\n***From the store:*** There is only one purpose, Open the door and escape! The cursed doll's room. Everything in the room is a hint. Like a tightly closed child's heart, this room is locked by itself and cannot be opened anymore.\n\n***My thoughts:*** For a $1.99 game I wasn\u2019t expecting much. Is there some jank? Yes. Is it detrimental to the experience? No. In fact, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fans of escape rooms. There\u2019s currently only the tutorial and one room, with more promised, but honestly if there\u2019s never any more, I still feel okay about it. The nice highlight is that you can play the game co-op - which I did, along with solo. Chatting through puzzles and experiencing the horror together was a fun experience. Buy this for you and a friend, and have fun together for 30-60 minutes.\n\n**11. Expansion**Free to play [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5803116093043612\/?utm_source=sidequest)\n\n***My quick take:*** A solid start on Tower Defense\n\n***From the store:*** Get into the shoes of a tactical warlord genius. Strategize, explore, and conquer as you build your own intergalactic empire. Engage in ultimate warfare and venture beyond the observable universe. Mastermind crucial decision-making and employ indirect control of units, relying on your strategic brilliance to outwit opponents.\n\n***My thoughts:*** A really solid foundation for a tower defense game. You get a lot for the free entry price. Bring a friend, or try the PVE against the computer. I felt the lack of details about what units do and how the items you could place felt a bit limiting, but if you like tower defense\/attack gameplay, it\u2019s pretty polished for what it is.\n\n**12. Vertigo 2**$29.99 [PCVR](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/843390\/Vertigo_2\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** Bigger, longer and more ambitious than the first, but without the magic of the first.\n\n***From the store:*** Vertigo 2 is a single-player adventure built from the ground up for VR. Deep underground in the reaches of Quantum Reactor VII, you awake to finish your journey home. You\u2019ll have to face bizarre alien flora and fauna leaking from other universes - and deadly android security forces whose job is to purge the reactor of all life. Try to determine who to trust as sinister agents lurk just out of sight.\n\n***My thoughts:*** Controversial, I know, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy Vertigo 2 as much as the first. Perhaps it was the newness of the first, the upgrades that felt a bit more meaningful and that gave me a sense of initial wonder. I certainly did quite enjoy the second game, just for the movement update alone, but there lacked a sense of \u201cnewness\u201d for me. All that being said, this really is a dynamite game, I can\u2019t deny that - perhaps one of the most ambitious and best of the year for VR. Absolutely give this one a go if you\u2019ve been feeling that VR games can\u2019t be epic, funny, long and interesting.\n\n**13. Hyperbolica**$11.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4873486596022103\/) \/ $16.99 [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1256230\/Hyperbolica\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A trippy adventure, but not for those who experience motion sickness.\n\n***From the store:*** Travel through Hyperbolica, a true Non-Euclidean curved space like you've never experienced before. Hyperbolic space allows more volume to fit in the same 'space' than you'd expect. This allows you to explore enormous areas while taking very little time to walk anywhere. Building a mental map of your surroundings becomes impossible. Straight lines don't stay parallel. Traversing the map can result in unexpected rotations. And many more strange consequences that make you question reality.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I really enjoy new experiences in VR, that\u2019s a big part of the appeal to me. This one certainly was something completely new. The movement and concept of traversal in this game was just mind bending. I don\u2019t get motion sick, but this really pushed the limits of it. The mini games and objectives ranged from very easy to needing exacting perfection to complete. I ended up falling off the game because of the latter. If you enjoy new experiences, watch the trailer and see if this is something that you might enjoy. It really is something quite different.\n\n**14. The Atlas Mystery**$14.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4287544621341628\/) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1787320\/The_Atlas_Mystery_A_VR_Puzzle_Game\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** A very polished escape room experience.\n\n***From the store:*** Immerse yourself in a thrilling supernatural murder mystery set in the twilight years of classic Hollywood. The Atlas Mystery combines challenging escape-room style puzzles with a riveting investigative narrative full of shocking twists and haunting revelations, plunging players into a detailed and captivating world inspired by classic cinema.\n\n***My thoughts:*** I really enjoyed this game. It was smart, the puzzles were just hard enough, and the story was unique and interesting. With a setting in an old-timey cinema, it felt unique and just a bit creepy. It took two to three hours to finish, but my biggest complaint is that it felt like there could have been more done with the puzzles they gave you. There were other items and mechanics that just seemed like they could be a puzzle as well, and weren\u2019t. I do recommend the game, but felt like there could have been a bit more.\n\n\\*\\*15. INVERSE (Early Access)\\*\\*Free [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4647145325362105\/?store=quest&amp;item_id=4647145325362105)\n\n***My quick take:*** A more \u201crealistic\u201d take on Among Us.\n\n***From the store:*** The Foundation wanted to advance teleportation technology. What they found was a pathway to a dangerous world beyond our own, and they opened the door to the creatures that inhabit it. Play together or die alone in INVERSE! INVERSE is played in 4-v-1 matches. Play co-op as the Agents, working together to restore power to the control terminals. Or play solo as the Nul monster, corrupting and incapacitating anyone you can find.\n\n***My thoughts:*** There\u2019s no question that this wears its inspiration of Among Us on its sleeve. The characters, mechanics and gameplay are very similar, with the twist of the enemy out in the open and hunting. There was a sense of tension, but in the games I played the monster had a distinct advantage. Maybe that will be ironed out when the game comes out of early access, which should be in September. It\u2019s free, so if the game looks interesting to you and you enjoy the concept of Among Us, give it a go.\n\n**16. Niftons Arena**$9.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4904605882894028\/?store=quest&amp;item_id=4904605882894028)\n\n***My quick take:*** A fully featured Lemmings-like strategy game that rewards the patient.\n\n***From the store:*** Step into the vibrant and fiercely competitive world of Niftons Arena - a real-time multiplayer strategy game that will test your wits, tactics, and quick thinking in virtual reality. Command your Niftons as they emerge from the mystical door into the arena. Your mission? To guide them safely through the chaotic battlefield to their exit gate. With matches lasting 20 or 30 minutes, you'll need to keep your eyes on the prize and your strategy sharp. The player who escorts the highest number of Niftons to the exit gate is the winner!\n\n***My thoughts:*** You can tell the amount of care that was put into this game. It has a ton of features and strategies that you can utilize to get your characters from point A to B while trying to stop your three other opponents from doing the same. The tutorial is exhaustive, and a bit daunting. The controls, while snappy, are a bit finicky due to needing to be placed in exact spots with certain requirements. This game really is deep, and the strategies and ways to progress are almost limitless. My biggest complaint was the lack of players. The A.I. is available, but real human competition is where it\u2019s at. If you can get a friend or two into this game, or find some people on their Discord to go against, I could see playing this for quite a while. This one looks simple, but it is deceptively hardcore.\n\n**17. Crimen - Mercenary Tales**$14.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4835782143201594\/?utm_source=crimen-vr.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect&amp;store=quest&amp;item_id=4835782143201594)\n\n***My quick take:*** A visually fun, but ultimately boring hack and slash.\n\n***From the store:*** Raise yer glasses high, me hearties! Embark on a (bloody!) journey through eight swashbucklin' tales of grandeur, riches, and legendary feats! Slash your way through eerie castles, ancient temples, forsaken shipwrecks, and other astonishing locations while wielding a variety of historically accurate weapons directly from the 17th-century.\n\n***My thoughts:*** The unique cartoon style graphics pulled me into this game, but by the end, I was hate-finishing it. The repetitive gameplay and lack of fresh ideas did not keep me interested for very long. That being said, I did finish it, in hopes of seeing something new or unique. It lasted about three hours, but aside from the occasional new mechanic sprinkled in, it was ultimately the same game 15 minutes in and 3 hours in.\n\n**18. Epic Roller Coasters**Free [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/2299465166734471\/?store=quest&amp;item_id=2299465166734471) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/787790\/Epic_Roller_Coasters\/)\n\n***My quick take:*** It\u2019s a roller coaster game, but boy did I enjoy it.\n\n***From the store:*** In Epic Roller Coasters you'll get the same feeling of real roller coasters in places and situations that probably you will never have in the real life! There are so many possibilities: magic, world of dinosaurs, haunted houses and so many others!\n\n***My thoughts:*** I get it, this is a game you show to someone who is new to VR, not a seasoned player. For some reason or another, I thought I\u2019d download this and give it a go, since I missed it when I first got my Quest. I can\u2019t say exactly why, but it just hit me in the right spot. I paid the $1.99 DLC for the faster cart and just sat back and enjoyed the scenery, while experiencing a bit of motion sickness - the good kind though that makes you feel like you\u2019re moving or somewhere else. I actually ended up buying all the rest of the DLC (there\u2019s quite a bit actually), and when I want to chill for 5 minutes, pop this on. It won\u2019t be for everyone, but even a hardcore VR player like me found quite a bit of joy in the simplicity of this game.\n\n**19. Glassbreakers**Free [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/9270732869663327\/?store&amp;item_id=9270732869663327) \/ [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/887330\/Glassbreakers_Champions_of_Moss\/) (releasing 2023)\n\n***My quick take:*** A beautiful looking game, but 1v1 is just not my jam.\n\n***From the store:*** Lead your squad of Champions into an immersive arena in this exciting game of strategy, magic, and power! From the developers of the Game Awards\u2019 2022 VR\/AR Game of the Year Moss: Book II, this 1v1 real-time battler puts you face to face with your opponent and their squad for action-packed gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.\n\n***My thoughts:*** From my note above, you\u2019d think I love everything Moss, but alas, this one was a real miss for me. I think it will be a big hit, with the strategies, characters and gameplay evolving to be a complex back and forth battle. Unfortunately, from what I played, it just wasn\u2019t very strategic and I won just by going headlong into my opponent. There are a lot of tutorials and unlockables, but I won\u2019t be revisiting it. It\u2019s free, so if you like 1v1 games and want to put in the time to learn, I think there\u2019s a lot of meat on the bone here.\n\n**20. A Knight in the Attic**$9.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4297523073681259\/?store=quest&amp;item_id=4297523073681259)\n\n***My quick take:*** A hidden gem that isn\u2019t as simple as it looks.\n\n***From the store:*** Guide Guinevere on a quest to save the kingdom from darkness. Find mysterious objects in a living labyrinth board to solve unique puzzles and defeat the evil Mordred, all from the comfort of your grandmother\u2019s attic. Take the world in your hands, and roll Guinevere through puzzle-filled levels, filled with strange objects that help guide you along your journey, from cranks and hammers to scrolls and an old notebook that tells the story of Camelot.\n\n***My thoughts:*** Essentially this game is like one of those wooden maze puzzles with the metal ball that you try to get into the right hole. But it\u2019s so much more than that. The puzzles are larger mazes that you can only see a part of. You get different abilities that you need to combine to progress, and it\u2019s sometimes a bit of a thinker. It\u2019s not a hardcore game by any means, but I certainly had to think about how to tackle certain areas. With a cute story, dialed in physics and just the right amount of difficulty, I highly recommend this one for all players.\n\n**21. VR 8 Ball Pool**$2.99 [Quest](https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5176354602393267\/?store=quest&amp;item_id=5176354602393267)\n\n***My quick take:*** Nothing mind blowing, just a solid pool game.\n\n***From the store:*** Sharp Forks is here with a mission to provide you with the most graphically realistic, and intuitive Pool game in the business. Crafted around the unique theme of the 1920s. The game integrates advanced physics simulations to deliver high realism in gameplay mechanics, making players feel as if they were physically present in a pool hall.\n\n***My thoughts:*** There\u2019s no shortage of pool games in the store, and this one kind of falls in the middle of the pack currently. I believe I got this for free, and now it\u2019s $2.99, so improvements or new features may have been added since I played. I know that more are planned. I will say that the graphics look much better than ForeVR Pool. The physics felt on point and the A.I. competition was solid. If you don\u2019t have a pool game and want to try it, the entry price is fair, especially if the planned updates come through.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI hope you find a few games on this list that you might not have heard of, or that you might find worth revisiting.

I&amp;#39;m currently up to 73 different VR games played this year. The first 22 that I played from January to March can be found &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/there-are-no-games-to-play-january-march-2023-edition\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt; and the 30 games I played from April to May are &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.rufftalkvr.com\/blog\/quick-thoughts-on-30-different-vr-games\/\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the games listed below, I can see playing all year long, others are not my cup of tea, but they may interest you enough to try them out. In either case, here are my quick thoughts on the 21 games I played during from June through August 2023.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: My top 5 games to check out from this list are at the bottom and so is some info for a game giveaway.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Espire 2&lt;\/strong&gt;$29.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/3529713943716002\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; More of the same, but with a few more fun gadgets to play with.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Experience unparalleled stealth action in two unique story campaigns with Espire 2, a full-fledged VR first person shooter on Meta Quest 2!  After intel from an anonymous whistleblower reveals the terrorist cell OPHIS\u2019 plot for global domination, Espire Operative Poe once again finds themselves at the center of the Espire program. With the entire world hanging in the balance, it\u2019s up to Poe and their Espire frames  to dismantle OPHIS from the inside.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A solid second entry. If you enjoyed the first, you\u2019ll like the second. Fun gunplay, stealth and new ideas to try here. Worth a pickup if you want a solid VR experience. The story is just okay though, and follows the first. I did run into some tricky spots with movement and figuring out where to go, but not enough to sour the experience. Worth a buy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. We Are One&lt;\/strong&gt;$19.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4052099231581371\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1669500\/We_Are_One\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4089073041145597\/\"&gt;Demo&lt;\/a&gt; (free)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; If you like score chasing and The Last Clockwinder, give this a go.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Team up with your greatest ally - YOURSELF - in this VR puzzle shooter where mind-bending challenges meet action-packed FPS gameplay! Plan ahead and clone versions of yourself that flawlessly execute your previous moves in multiple time loops. Battle your way across increasingly complex levels set against the backdrop of a vibrant, hand drawn VR world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I played this one back on the App Lab days and was so excited to finally see it come to the full store. It met all my high-score chasing expectations. The gunplay, movement, story and progression are so fine tuned and dialed in that when you make a mistake, you know it was on you. It has a unique gameplay mechanic similar to The Last Clockwinder that is both intuitive and quite special. If you just go through the game straight through, you\u2019ll finish in a couple hours and have a fun time, if you stick around for some high-score chasing, you\u2019ll find many more hours of precision gameplay ahead of you. One of my favorites this year. A true gem in the store.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Shuttle Maze&lt;\/strong&gt;$11.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4055335517833878\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A neat maze adventure with a cute story.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Step into a retro 80s arcade-inspired game with Shuttle Maze proudly made by Ayayu Games! The year is 2062 and Glow is trapped by Maze Phreak - a crazy AI, gone wild. Help Glow, the renegade space racing pilot, to get her license back by finding the famous genius AI-computer-scientist, Dr. Harris. Featuring a rich story line with animated cutscenes and phenomenal voice acting, Shuttle Maze feels like a rich blend of 80s retro arcade and watching your favorite Saturday morning cartoon.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I only played the game trial for 15 minutes and got to experience the first level. While I enjoyed the graphics and what I saw of the story, I didn\u2019t feel compelled to buy the full game. I\u2019m sure there was plenty more to experience, but escaping a maze and its traps just did not pull me in. Try out the demo for sure to see if you may enjoy it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Coffee Shop Simulator VR&lt;\/strong&gt;$14.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5905492699487778\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; If you want to be a barista and run your own store, you\u2019ll have to put up with a bunch of jank first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Become a Coffee Shop owner with Coffee Shop Simulator VR! Start small with easy recipes and extend your business by ordering more ingredients and light food end expanding the shop building. Never forget to pay the bills for the shop! Be a world class level barista and a great owner but never be afraid of other small jobs in the coffee shop. Follow the recipes to serve well-known coffee drinks or add your own touch but remember, the customers satisfaction is all about a great coffee taste! Enjoy one of the best graphics on Quest!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Still rough around the edges despite having seen some updates. I enjoy simulation games and there\u2019s a lot to do here, place orders for food, coffee and ingredients, create a variety of drinks and deliver them in a timely manner. The issue is there is just a lot of jank still, and maybe in six months this one could be a solid experience, as for now, it\u2019s just a bit too rough to recommend.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Ghosts of Tabor&lt;\/strong&gt;$19.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/7614022262006379\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957780\/Ghosts_of_Tabor\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; For a game still in beta, this one really shines.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Ghosts of Tabor is the only extraction based VR FPS PVP and PVE survival game where you will have to use your wits, skills and resources to survive. Inspired by games such as Escape from Tarkov and Day Z, the game features a variety of scenarios from scavenging, looting to crafting. Make your safehouse your own by building your personal collection weapons and gear to display in your armory.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; There has been a ton of buzz around the survival game Ghosts of Tabor, and rightfully so. With the lead of the game focusing on hyper realism with gunplay, ammo types and gear, I highly recommend jumping in with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing to show you the ropes. The tutorial (when I played it), lacked quite a bit of the details, and when I went in solo for my first game, I was quite lost. A few games later after playing with some people from the Tabor community, I had my feet under me. With the game still in beta, lots of testing, full game wipes and changes are happening, but they seem to be listening to their community and doing a great job. Pick this up if you\u2019re into games like Escape from Tarkov and DayZ.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Sherlock Holmes: The Case of the Hung Parliament&lt;\/strong&gt;$11.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4624529214241452\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A fun collaborative who-done-it, but with some technical issues.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Don your deerstalker and step into the shoes of the world\u2019s most famous sleuth in this gripping live-action 1-4 player point-and-click mystery detective adventure. With three cabinet members already murdered by hanging and Sherlock Holmes missing in action, it is up to you to find the killer before Big Ben strikes midnight. Interrogate suspects, analyze crime scenes, collect evidence, and enter your \u2018Mind Palace\u2019 to construct a compelling case in this \u2018Whodunit\u2019 that will push your deduction skills to their limits. Play alone or with friends to make this a social sleuthing experience you will never forget.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I played with three other people and right away the game stated that the multiplayer was still in beta. Well, that was true because only two of the four people could see the story playing out at times, and missed some audio in other parts. It was a neat time being in different real-life 360 degree scanned rooms all looking for clues before the timer runs out. There were lively discussions within our group as to who did the crime. All that being said, we had to take a vote who we thought did the crime and ended up getting it wrong. An acceptable outcome, but none of us have revisited it to try again as everything was time locked and you had to spend a certain amount of time in each room and couldn\u2019t skip through if you had already played it once. A mixed bag, but a decent night with friends for the cost.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Moss: Book II&lt;\/strong&gt;$19.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4395292760584049\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/2059670\/Moss_Book_II\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; New worlds and gameplay all wrapped in a familiar, yet fresh approach.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Quill is back\u2014and she\u2019s being hunted. Those who seek to unmake this world are desperate for the Glass she holds, and they\u2019ll stop at nothing to claw it from her grasp. But the young hero has a plan of her own, one that could finally end the merciless rule of the Arcane and restore peace to Moss once more. To stand a chance, Quill will need a true partner by her side\u2014and we hope that partner is you. With her, you\u2019ll venture deep inside the hexed castle of the Arcane where dangerous terrain, challenging puzzles, and enemies twisted in fire and steel await.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I quite enjoyed the first Moss game and finally played the second. I recommend you play the first if you haven\u2019t, as this picks up right after the first one ends. It\u2019s a lot of the same platforming, action and puzzling as the first, but there is a unique twist which I quite enjoyed and will not spoil here. The scenery and sense of traversal across the world is spectacular and the levels are a real treat. While the swordplay and puzzles aren\u2019t always the most exciting, it\u2019s still a grand time. If you haven\u2019t played this series, or this game yet, it\u2019s one of the best VR experiences and series on the Quest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. BallisticVR&lt;\/strong&gt;$9.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5814904788638794\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A sometimes frustrating puzzle game where every minute adjustment matters.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s a puzzle game where you start by taking a tutorial to teach you how to use the input system to control the missiles before launch them to hit the targets. The directions that the player inputs is relative to the missile&amp;#39;s axis all the time and the player can hit the targets with so many variations of inputs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; This looked like an interesting puzzle game to plan out your route, get your coordinates dialed in and fine tune each movement. The bones of a solid game are here but I think there are some real opportunities for quality of life updates that hold this back. Dials should interact differently, and more options for comfort and movement need to be added as well. All that being said, if you want to think, tinker and play a solo game, each level takes a good amount of time and lots of trial and error.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Task Force 9 Demo&lt;\/strong&gt;Free &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/7182152818468130\/?utm_source=sidequest\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; An ambitious game, but just too rough around the edges.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Task Force 9 is a cutthroat VR game where players must ruthlessly take out enemies using any means necessary, whether it be through brute force or sneaky tactics. You&amp;#39;ll have to strategically maneuver your AI partner while relying on cover, explosives, rappelling, wall breaching, and ambushes to gain the upper hand. This game is not for the faint of heart, as it it not just one more tactical shooter but we aims to sharpen your instincts in the brutal world of close-quarters combat. Are you ready to put your skills to the test?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; This is an ambitious game that has a Breachers single player feel, but without any of the polish. It may get there, but I found myself flailing around struggling to get things to work. My AI partner got stuck and the controls just didn\u2019t feel intuitive. Might be worth checking back in to see how it has progressed in a few months.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Escape Room Online&lt;\/strong&gt;$1.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/9023860981020066\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A $1.99 co-op horror escape room that is absolutely worth the price of admission.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; There is only one purpose, Open the door and escape! The cursed doll&amp;#39;s room. Everything in the room is a hint. Like a tightly closed child&amp;#39;s heart, this room is locked by itself and cannot be opened anymore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; For a $1.99 game I wasn\u2019t expecting much. Is there some jank? Yes. Is it detrimental to the experience? No. In fact, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fans of escape rooms. There\u2019s currently only the tutorial and one room, with more promised, but honestly if there\u2019s never any more, I still feel okay about it. The nice highlight is that you can play the game co-op - which I did, along with solo. Chatting through puzzles and experiencing the horror together was a fun experience. Buy this for you and a friend, and have fun together for 30-60 minutes.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Expansion&lt;\/strong&gt;Free to play &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5803116093043612\/?utm_source=sidequest\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A solid start on Tower Defense&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Get into the shoes of a tactical warlord genius. Strategize, explore, and conquer as you build your own intergalactic empire. Engage in ultimate warfare and venture beyond the observable universe. Mastermind crucial decision-making and employ indirect control of units, relying on your strategic brilliance to outwit opponents.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A really solid foundation for a tower defense game. You get a lot for the free entry price. Bring a friend, or try the PVE against the computer. I felt the lack of details about what units do and how the items you could place felt a bit limiting, but if you like tower defense\/attack gameplay, it\u2019s pretty polished for what it is.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Vertigo 2&lt;\/strong&gt;$29.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/843390\/Vertigo_2\/\"&gt;PCVR&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Bigger, longer and more ambitious than the first, but without the magic of the first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Vertigo 2 is a single-player adventure built from the ground up for VR. Deep underground in the reaches of Quantum Reactor VII, you awake to finish your journey home. You\u2019ll have to face bizarre alien flora and fauna leaking from other universes - and deadly android security forces whose job is to purge the reactor of all life. Try to determine who to trust as sinister agents lurk just out of sight.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Controversial, I know, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy Vertigo 2 as much as the first. Perhaps it was the newness of the first, the upgrades that felt a bit more meaningful and that gave me a sense of initial wonder. I certainly did quite enjoy the second game, just for the movement update alone, but there lacked a sense of \u201cnewness\u201d for me. All that being said, this really is a dynamite game, I can\u2019t deny that - perhaps one of the most ambitious and best of the year for VR. Absolutely give this one a go if you\u2019ve been feeling that VR games can\u2019t be epic, funny, long and interesting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Hyperbolica&lt;\/strong&gt;$11.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4873486596022103\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ $16.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1256230\/Hyperbolica\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A trippy adventure, but not for those who experience motion sickness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Travel through Hyperbolica, a true Non-Euclidean curved space like you&amp;#39;ve never experienced before. Hyperbolic space allows more volume to fit in the same &amp;#39;space&amp;#39; than you&amp;#39;d expect. This allows you to explore enormous areas while taking very little time to walk anywhere. Building a mental map of your surroundings becomes impossible. Straight lines don&amp;#39;t stay parallel. Traversing the map can result in unexpected rotations. And many more strange consequences that make you question reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I really enjoy new experiences in VR, that\u2019s a big part of the appeal to me. This one certainly was something completely new. The movement and concept of traversal in this game was just mind bending. I don\u2019t get motion sick, but this really pushed the limits of it. The mini games and objectives ranged from very easy to needing exacting perfection to complete. I ended up falling off the game because of the latter. If you enjoy new experiences, watch the trailer and see if this is something that you might enjoy. It really is something quite different.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. The Atlas Mystery&lt;\/strong&gt;$14.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4287544621341628\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1787320\/The_Atlas_Mystery_A_VR_Puzzle_Game\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A very polished escape room experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Immerse yourself in a thrilling supernatural murder mystery set in the twilight years of classic Hollywood. The Atlas Mystery combines challenging escape-room style puzzles with a riveting investigative narrative full of shocking twists and haunting revelations, plunging players into a detailed and captivating world inspired by classic cinema.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I really enjoyed this game. It was smart, the puzzles were just hard enough, and the story was unique and interesting. With a setting in an old-timey cinema, it felt unique and just a bit creepy. It took two to three hours to finish, but my biggest complaint is that it felt like there could have been more done with the puzzles they gave you. There were other items and mechanics that just seemed like they could be a puzzle as well, and weren\u2019t. I do recommend the game, but felt like there could have been a bit more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;**15. INVERSE (Early Access)**Free &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4647145325362105\/?store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=4647145325362105\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A more \u201crealistic\u201d take on Among Us.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; The Foundation wanted to advance teleportation technology. What they found was a pathway to a dangerous world beyond our own, and they opened the door to the creatures that inhabit it. Play together or die alone in INVERSE! INVERSE is played in 4-v-1 matches. Play co-op as the Agents, working together to restore power to the control terminals. Or play solo as the Nul monster, corrupting and incapacitating anyone you can find.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; There\u2019s no question that this wears its inspiration of Among Us on its sleeve. The characters, mechanics and gameplay are very similar, with the twist of the enemy out in the open and hunting. There was a sense of tension, but in the games I played the monster had a distinct advantage. Maybe that will be ironed out when the game comes out of early access, which should be in September. It\u2019s free, so if the game looks interesting to you and you enjoy the concept of Among Us, give it a go.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Niftons Arena&lt;\/strong&gt;$9.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4904605882894028\/?store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=4904605882894028\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A fully featured Lemmings-like strategy game that rewards the patient.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Step into the vibrant and fiercely competitive world of Niftons Arena - a real-time multiplayer strategy game that will test your wits, tactics, and quick thinking in virtual reality. Command your Niftons as they emerge from the mystical door into the arena. Your mission? To guide them safely through the chaotic battlefield to their exit gate. With matches lasting 20 or 30 minutes, you&amp;#39;ll need to keep your eyes on the prize and your strategy sharp. The player who escorts the highest number of Niftons to the exit gate is the winner!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; You can tell the amount of care that was put into this game. It has a ton of features and strategies that you can utilize to get your characters from point A to B while trying to stop your three other opponents from doing the same. The tutorial is exhaustive, and a bit daunting. The controls, while snappy, are a bit finicky due to needing to be placed in exact spots with certain requirements. This game really is deep, and the strategies and ways to progress are almost limitless. My biggest complaint was the lack of players. The A.I. is available, but real human competition is where it\u2019s at. If you can get a friend or two into this game, or find some people on their Discord to go against, I could see playing this for quite a while. This one looks simple, but it is deceptively hardcore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. Crimen - Mercenary Tales&lt;\/strong&gt;$14.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4835782143201594\/?utm_source=crimen-vr.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect&amp;amp;store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=4835782143201594\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A visually fun, but ultimately boring hack and slash.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Raise yer glasses high, me hearties! Embark on a (bloody!) journey through eight swashbucklin&amp;#39; tales of grandeur, riches, and legendary feats! Slash your way through eerie castles, ancient temples, forsaken shipwrecks, and other astonishing locations while wielding a variety of historically accurate weapons directly from the 17th-century.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; The unique cartoon style graphics pulled me into this game, but by the end, I was hate-finishing it. The repetitive gameplay and lack of fresh ideas did not keep me interested for very long. That being said, I did finish it, in hopes of seeing something new or unique. It lasted about three hours, but aside from the occasional new mechanic sprinkled in, it was ultimately the same game 15 minutes in and 3 hours in.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. Epic Roller Coasters&lt;\/strong&gt;Free &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/2299465166734471\/?store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=2299465166734471\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/787790\/Epic_Roller_Coasters\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; It\u2019s a roller coaster game, but boy did I enjoy it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; In Epic Roller Coasters you&amp;#39;ll get the same feeling of real roller coasters in places and situations that probably you will never have in the real life! There are so many possibilities: magic, world of dinosaurs, haunted houses and so many others!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; I get it, this is a game you show to someone who is new to VR, not a seasoned player. For some reason or another, I thought I\u2019d download this and give it a go, since I missed it when I first got my Quest. I can\u2019t say exactly why, but it just hit me in the right spot. I paid the $1.99 DLC for the faster cart and just sat back and enjoyed the scenery, while experiencing a bit of motion sickness - the good kind though that makes you feel like you\u2019re moving or somewhere else. I actually ended up buying all the rest of the DLC (there\u2019s quite a bit actually), and when I want to chill for 5 minutes, pop this on. It won\u2019t be for everyone, but even a hardcore VR player like me found quite a bit of joy in the simplicity of this game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. Glassbreakers&lt;\/strong&gt;Free &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/9270732869663327\/?store&amp;amp;item_id=9270732869663327\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt; \/ &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/887330\/Glassbreakers_Champions_of_Moss\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\/a&gt; (releasing 2023)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A beautiful looking game, but 1v1 is just not my jam.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Lead your squad of Champions into an immersive arena in this exciting game of strategy, magic, and power! From the developers of the Game Awards\u2019 2022 VR\/AR Game of the Year Moss: Book II, this 1v1 real-time battler puts you face to face with your opponent and their squad for action-packed gameplay that will keep you coming back for more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; From my note above, you\u2019d think I love everything Moss, but alas, this one was a real miss for me. I think it will be a big hit, with the strategies, characters and gameplay evolving to be a complex back and forth battle. Unfortunately, from what I played, it just wasn\u2019t very strategic and I won just by going headlong into my opponent. There are a lot of tutorials and unlockables, but I won\u2019t be revisiting it. It\u2019s free, so if you like 1v1 games and want to put in the time to learn, I think there\u2019s a lot of meat on the bone here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. A Knight in the Attic&lt;\/strong&gt;$9.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/4297523073681259\/?store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=4297523073681259\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; A hidden gem that isn\u2019t as simple as it looks.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Guide Guinevere on a quest to save the kingdom from darkness. Find mysterious objects in a living labyrinth board to solve unique puzzles and defeat the evil Mordred, all from the comfort of your grandmother\u2019s attic. Take the world in your hands, and roll Guinevere through puzzle-filled levels, filled with strange objects that help guide you along your journey, from cranks and hammers to scrolls and an old notebook that tells the story of Camelot.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Essentially this game is like one of those wooden maze puzzles with the metal ball that you try to get into the right hole. But it\u2019s so much more than that. The puzzles are larger mazes that you can only see a part of. You get different abilities that you need to combine to progress, and it\u2019s sometimes a bit of a thinker. It\u2019s not a hardcore game by any means, but I certainly had to think about how to tackle certain areas. With a cute story, dialed in physics and just the right amount of difficulty, I highly recommend this one for all players.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. VR 8 Ball Pool&lt;\/strong&gt;$2.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/quest\/5176354602393267\/?store=quest&amp;amp;item_id=5176354602393267\"&gt;Quest&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My quick take:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Nothing mind blowing, just a solid pool game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the store:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; Sharp Forks is here with a mission to provide you with the most graphically realistic, and intuitive Pool game in the business. Crafted around the unique theme of the 1920s. The game integrates advanced physics simulations to deliver high realism in gameplay mechanics, making players feel as if they were physically present in a pool hall.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; There\u2019s no shortage of pool games in the store, and this one kind of falls in the middle of the pack currently. I believe I got this for free, and now it\u2019s $2.99, so improvements or new features may have been added since I played. I know that more are planned. I will say that the graphics look much better than ForeVR Pool. The physics felt on point and the A.I. competition was solid. If you don\u2019t have a pool game and want to try it, the entry price is fair, especially if the planned updates come through.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_______________&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you find a few games on this list that you might not have heard of, or that you might find worth revisiting.

However, the actual performance is usually much worse than that, and when I look at the Virtual Desktop performance overlay, it shows that my frametime is apparently much slower, sometimes more than 2 times as slow than what I see on the SteamVR graph!  I just don't get why my actual performance is so much slower when I can clearly see that my GPU (an RTX 4070, for the record) is handling the game just fine.\n\nHere's a few things I tried to troubleshoot this problem:\n\n* Turning off Nvidia overlay\n* Using OpenVR Advanced settings\n* Changing the OpenXR runtime from SteamVR to Oculus\n* Changing settings on the Nvidia Control Panel\n   * Changing Virtual Reality pre-rendered frames from 1 to 4\n   * Changing Virtual Reality - Variable Rate Super Sampling from Off to Always On\n* Turning on WiFi (I always use Ethernet so I didn't think that I needed a WiFi connection, so I turned it off)\n* Using WiFi instead of Ethernet\n* Switching the network profile type from public network to private network\n* Other stuff that I can't remember, I tried a lot of different things\n\nOne thing that I'd like to note is that even though it says in the provided screenshots that my PC is connected via ethernet, it is connected to a range extender rather than my router. My router is upstairs while my PC is downstairs, so I had to opt for connecting my PC to an extender. I don't know if the problem is network related, but I just thought to write that information here anyways.\n\nSo what could be the problem? Is there even a problem? Is it normal to get a performance degradation when using Virtual Desktop? Any help is very appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here I'm in Rec Room testing the performance. As you can see, the SteamVR graph on the bottom reports a stable frametime graph, while the \\\\\"Game\\\\\" reading shows that I'm getting a frametime of 11 ms. Occasionally the Game reading will increase to 12 ms or even 13 ms, leading to a frame drop.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yimbap82bihb1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78ac7aa72d0c5bf820934d58c6788c32e63e8643)\n\n[Here's another screenshot showing me testing the performance, this time using the scope on a sniper, which I found is intensive. Again, the SteamVR graph reports a stable frametime of 7.9 ms, while the Virtual Desktop overlay reports a frametime of 14 ms. You can also see that my framerate is dropping into the 70s, even though I should be getting 90 with plenty of headroom. It isn't a problem with stuttering either, since the SteamVR graph is almost completely green.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tm2lf66mbihb1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3e3dd1037bd860c1bb1309d88c46c06502cc75c)\n\n[This is my normal system configuration whenever I use SteamVR and Virtual Desktop. Whenever I'm not playing anything, the In-Game Overlay is set to on, the User Scenario is set to Balanced \\(Extreme Performance is the same as the Ultimate Performance power plan, and Balanced is the

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I use Virtual Desktop on my Quest 2 to play on SteamVR, the SteamVR graph shows that I&amp;#39;m getting a smooth and stable frametime. However, the actual performance is usually much worse than that, and when I look at the Virtual Desktop performance overlay, it shows that my frametime is apparently much slower, sometimes more than 2 times as slow than what I see on the SteamVR graph!  I just don&amp;#39;t get why my actual performance is so much slower when I can clearly see that my GPU (an RTX 4070, for the record) is handling the game just fine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a few things I tried to troubleshoot this problem:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turning off Nvidia overlay&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using OpenVR Advanced settings&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changing the OpenXR runtime from SteamVR to Oculus&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changing settings on the Nvidia Control Panel\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changing Virtual Reality pre-rendered frames from 1 to 4&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Changing Virtual Reality - Variable Rate Super Sampling from Off to Always On&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Turning on WiFi (I always use Ethernet so I didn&amp;#39;t think that I needed a WiFi connection, so I turned it off)&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using WiFi instead of Ethernet&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Switching the network profile type from public network to private network&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other stuff that I can&amp;#39;t remember, I tried a lot of different things&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing that I&amp;#39;d like to note is that even though it says in the provided screenshots that my PC is connected via ethernet, it is connected to a range extender rather than my router. My router is upstairs while my PC is downstairs, so I had to opt for connecting my PC to an extender. I don&amp;#39;t know if the problem is network related, but I just thought to write that information here anyways.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what could be the problem? Is there even a problem? Is it normal to get a performance degradation when using Virtual Desktop? Any help is very appreciated.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yimbap82bihb1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=78ac7aa72d0c5bf820934d58c6788c32e63e8643\"&gt;Here I&amp;#39;m in Rec Room testing the performance. As you can see, the SteamVR graph on the bottom reports a stable frametime graph, while the \\&amp;quot;Game\\&amp;quot; reading shows that I&amp;#39;m getting a frametime of 11 ms. Occasionally the Game reading will increase to 12 ms or even 13 ms, leading to a frame drop.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tm2lf66mbihb1.jpg?width=1024&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a3e3dd1037bd860c1bb1309d88c46c06502cc75c\"&gt;Here&amp;#39;s another screenshot showing me testing the performance, this time using the scope on a sniper, which I found is intensive. Again, the SteamVR graph reports a stable frametime of 7.9 ms, while the Virtual Desktop overlay reports a frametime of 14 ms. You can also see that my framerate is dropping into the 70s, even though I should be getting 90 with plenty of headroom. It isn&amp;#39;t a problem with stuttering either, since the SteamVR graph is almost completely green.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/tw8k3n33cihb1.jpg?width=1600&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=23435bf2916a982f5dde8535333d5e759181df18\"&gt;This is my normal system configuration whenever I use SteamVR and Virtual Desktop.

The idea behind this is just purely entertainment-based, I just wanted to have some fun and have a chat here. Here's the analysis:  \nImmersive environments: In VR, this is usually the number one thing that comes to mind, and with good reason. Immersion in VR is unmatched when compared to other platforms, and it is no surprise that the feeling you get when playing is second to none. With that said, like in any other game, the level of immersion isn\u2019t the same. It depends on several factors; mostly design, graphics, and sound, and in my book, Into the Radius, MS Flight Simulator Skyrim and Star Wars: Squadrons excel in this category. \n\nStory and storytelling: Very important category, although it doesn\u2019t apply to every game since some simply don\u2019t have a storyline. Speaking about those that do, Alyx and Skyrim have the storyline and the way it unravels that I like more than the others. \n\nWeapons design: Under this category, I count everything from graphics to fidelity and physics. Basically, everything relevant related to weapons; from how they look to how they behave. In this segment, games that shine the most are H3VR and Into the Radius with the first title having a slight advantage in the physics department (ITR can be clunky at times), but ITR looks better while also having an admirable sense of realism.\n\nGameplay depth and progression: From the number of things you can do to the ways you progress through the game, and all the additional elements in between. Naturally, open-world games have a very different approach from linear ones, so I will divide the games by type. When we talk about open-world, Fallout 4, and Into the Radius I consider them to be the champions, while in a linear category, Alyx takes the crown.\n\nMusic and sound design: Pretty self-explanatory, and no further breakdown needed :) That said, sound is one of the most important categories in a game so I wasn\u2019t going to leave it out. Music and sound affect our feelings the most, and when done right in a game, they add to the overall experience tremendously. In that sense, Beat Saber is truly amazing but, since it is literally based on sound, perhaps it\u2019s not the best example. From games not based on sound, I love how it was done in Alyx and Alien: Isolation. Not that other games don\u2019t have great sound, but these two appeal the most to me.  \nI am an analytical person and love doing breakdowns like this one. Goes without saying that this is my list and is ultimately based on my taste and preference. However, I\u2019d also very much love to hear other people\u2019s opinions on my analysis, so please tell me if I should have done anything differently, or added some games.
