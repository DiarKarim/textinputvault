I lost their username after I pressed 'post' and wasn't sure if they'd see the response so I figured I'd share it here. It might be useful for other people too who are in need of this info.\n\nCheers \ud83d\ude4f\n\nOriginal Comment:\n\nHmm... I can't say definitively, and it might be worth looking for specific games (or [communities](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/disabledgamers\/comments\/xh6jln\/vr_and_the_disabled_community\/) ([2](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/disabledgamers\/comments\/m3pu4c\/discord_for_disabled_gamers\/))\/mods\/[applications](https:\/\/www.walkinvrdriver.com\/), and even reddit\/x\/discord searches for [existing discussion from other people](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/152uj71\/virtual_reality_and_accessibility_for_short_and\/)) that have this in mind specifically... but there are some games that can be played with just a controller\/mouse and keyboard, especially if you have a PC (GTA:V and Subnautica are fantastic in VR with controller, most VR platformers like Moss or Lucky's Tale should work, and the UEVR mod for most Unreal Engine games is going to open up the list of controller-supported games a ***lot*** more)\n\nIf you want to try just going the normal route with motion-tracked VR controllers, I think you could get away with playing some shooters with one hand... but only the ones that have more automatic reloading (Robo Recall comes to mind, but I'd make another thread asking specifically about this) unless  you have some creative solution for how to work around that (using your feet, for example, which you may need to do for movement regardless depending on the game. I've certainly seen some very creative\/dexterous people who are disabled or partially-abled in gaming, sports, [shooting irl](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/M2UvmfsiCR4) \\[this person is also DIYing solutions with what looks like [Sugru](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=sugru&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss) or a similar molding-plastic\\], and whatever else you can imagine)\n\nPSVR2 also has eye tracking, and may have additional accessibility features utilizing that added input vector. Apple Vision Pro will also have that, but the first generation is going to be quite expensive and not really geared toward gaming- though I think with time it will be and Apple is a fantastic company when it comes to accessibility.\n\nThere are also some games you might be surprised by that don't just *require* only one arm, but actually *benefit* from only holding one controller. Walkabout Mini Golf, Golf+, and Eleven Table Tennis come to mind. I am someone who spends probably 60% of my gaming time playing shooters, but I have a blast with these games, especially with friends, so I definitely recommend checking them out. VR can definitely make games more interesting and engaging than they might be for you on a screen.\n\n**I know Meta is currently running a 30 day 'trial', and Amazon allows returns all the way through January 31st right now... so if nothing else it's worth trying if you don't mind the amazon return process (personally I find it super easy).**\n\nYou can also automatically refund any game played under 2 hours and purchased less than 14 days prior to the return, both on Quest and Steam. You can additionally contact support if you go a bit over those limits... and I'm sure if you explained your situation and told them that you spent some of those 2 hours trying to find workarounds for your needs, etc... that they would accept the return.\n\nBest of luck! Hope you can find some accessible games or ways to adapt them to your needs. Even if you don't, keep in mind that it's all still very new, and small in the grand scheme of the tech\/gaming world. Accessibility will improve with increased adoption, so if you find there's not enough to easily enjoy now... it's still worth checking back in a year or two to see if it hasn't improved!\n\nCheers \ud83d\ude4f","author_fullname":"t2_2l6nw03b","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"To the person who deleted their post on accessibility in VR","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"green","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_182vg4z","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1700842049.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/182u9r9\/is_vr_accessible\/\"&gt;this post&lt;\/a&gt; about playing VR with only one arm got deleted, and I just wanted to make sure OP saw my comment.

I can&amp;#39;t say definitively, and it might be worth looking for specific games (or &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/disabledgamers\/comments\/xh6jln\/vr_and_the_disabled_community\/\"&gt;communities&lt;\/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/disabledgamers\/comments\/m3pu4c\/discord_for_disabled_gamers\/\"&gt;2&lt;\/a&gt;)\/mods\/&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.walkinvrdriver.com\/\"&gt;applications&lt;\/a&gt;, and even reddit\/x\/discord searches for &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/152uj71\/virtual_reality_and_accessibility_for_short_and\/\"&gt;existing discussion from other people&lt;\/a&gt;) that have this in mind specifically... but there are some games that can be played with just a controller\/mouse and keyboard, especially if you have a PC (GTA:V and Subnautica are fantastic in VR with controller, most VR platformers like Moss or Lucky&amp;#39;s Tale should work, and the UEVR mod for most Unreal Engine games is going to open up the list of controller-supported games a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/strong&gt; more)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to try just going the normal route with motion-tracked VR controllers, I think you could get away with playing some shooters with one hand... but only the ones that have more automatic reloading (Robo Recall comes to mind, but I&amp;#39;d make another thread asking specifically about this) unless  you have some creative solution for how to work around that (using your feet, for example, which you may need to do for movement regardless depending on the game. I&amp;#39;ve certainly seen some very creative\/dexterous people who are disabled or partially-abled in gaming, sports, &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shorts\/M2UvmfsiCR4\"&gt;shooting irl&lt;\/a&gt; [this person is also DIYing solutions with what looks like &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=sugru&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss\"&gt;Sugru&lt;\/a&gt; or a similar molding-plastic], and whatever else you can imagine)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PSVR2 also has eye tracking, and may have additional accessibility features utilizing that added input vector. Apple Vision Pro will also have that, but the first generation is going to be quite expensive and not really geared toward gaming- though I think with time it will be and Apple is a fantastic company when it comes to accessibility.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also some games you might be surprised by that don&amp;#39;t just &lt;em&gt;require&lt;\/em&gt; only one arm, but actually &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;\/em&gt; from only holding one controller. Walkabout Mini Golf, Golf+, and Eleven Table Tennis come to mind. I am someone who spends probably 60% of my gaming time playing shooters, but I have a blast with these games, especially with friends, so I definitely recommend checking them out. VR can definitely make games more interesting and engaging than they might be for you on a screen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know Meta is currently running a 30 day &amp;#39;trial&amp;#39;, and Amazon allows returns all the way through January 31st right now... so if nothing else it&amp;#39;s worth trying if you don&amp;#39;t mind the amazon return process (personally I find it super easy).&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also automatically refund any game played under 2 hours and purchased less than 14 days prior to the return, both on Quest and Steam. You can additionally contact support if you go a bit over those limits... and I&amp;#39;m sure if you explained your situation and told them that you spent some of those 2 hours trying to find workarounds for your needs, etc... that they would accept the return.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Best of luck! Hope you can find some accessible games or ways to adapt them to your needs. Even if you don&amp;#39;t, keep in mind that it&amp;#39;s all still very new, and small in the grand scheme of the tech\/gaming world. Accessibility will improve with increased adoption, so if you find there&amp;#39;s not enough to easily enjoy now... it&amp;#39;s still worth checking back in a year or two to see if it hasn&amp;#39;t improved!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers \ud83d\ude4f&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/MuVkI3V68U_fZ6ebgl39pwqgnHvf6Y0_2P5aosDz7bk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=62cd1c66fa46c1d492bb566c355697111d4cdf75","width":782,"height":582},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/MuVkI3V68U_fZ6ebgl39pwqgnHvf6Y0_2P5aosDz7bk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5eafb06ab257714e819bec79122560bc26b95a97","width":108,"height":80},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/MuVkI3V68U_fZ6ebgl39pwqgnHvf6Y0_2P5aosDz7bk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=599c5eb4b69dface80f0c31cd226ac8f69ae9790","width":216,"height":160},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/MuVkI3V68U_fZ6ebgl39pwqgnHvf6Y0_2P5aosDz7bk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=62fcf872c1f60c9b56c23c7f7d73910038376cdf","width":320,"height":238},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/MuVkI3V68U_fZ6ebgl39pwqgnHvf6Y0_2P5aosDz7bk.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49b30004d8017f886d4fa5b90835f42d04aff285","width":640,"height":476}],"variants":{},"id":"iMl35buMTIU3kQ4RWe5al5DZLHQxRc9Ex0WLUapyJO4"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"b193c526-b043-11e3-bcb9-12313d21b86e","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"182vg4z","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"jPup_VR","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/182vg4z\/to_the_person_who_deleted_their_post_on\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/182vg4z\/to_the_person_who_deleted_their_post_on\/","subreddit_subscribers":493162,"created_utc":1700842049.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"oculus","selftext":"","user_reports":[],"saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"[SKYBOX VR] Quest v1.1.6(beta): Multi-language keyboard, deleting SMB files","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"slategrey","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_180dhrq","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"author_fullname":"t2_159wfl","secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"default","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":false,"mod_note":null,"crosspost_parent_list":[{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"SKYBOXVR","selftext":"Hi everyone,\n\nThe new beta v1.1.6 for SKYBOX is being rolled out on Quest store.

If your television doesn't support this, you can, for example, buy a Chromecast stick that you plug into your television.\n\n**Tip 2: Set Quest 3 to factory settings**\n\nIf your VR headset no longer work at all, even after a restart, or you want to sell the headset and a reset via the app doesn't work, you can perform a factory reset from recovery mode. To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on. When the Meta logo is displayed, release the keys. In the menu that appears, select Factory Reset.\n\n**Tip 3: Reset view**\n\nTo reset the view of both your active app and the home menu, simply press and hold the meta button on the right controller for 2 seconds.\n\n**Tip 4: Refund app purchases**\n\nIf you purchased an app from the Meta Store, you can get a refund if you don't like it if you have used the app for less than 2 hours and purchased it no more than 14 days ago. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.\n\n**Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz**\n\nIf you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Display and activate \u201c120Hz refresh rate\u201d. Please note that it requires a little more battery power.\n\n**Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller**\n\nIf you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.\n\n**Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation**\n\nIf it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.\n\n**Tip 8: Avoid sunlight**\n\nMake sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds. The lenses are basically magnifying glasses and they can burn your display. It is therefore best not to use it outside or leave it near a window.\n\n**Tip 9: Avoid motion sickness**\n\nIf you are a VR beginner or generally prone to motion sickness, check how intensive the app is before you buy an app in the store. Green means comfortable, you can't get sick, but you should be more careful with the orange or even red category.\n\n**Tip 10: Room scan with furniture**\n\nYou can scan your entire room or even your entire apartment to prepare it for mixed reality apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Physical Room -&gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.\n\n**Tip 11: Developer Mode**\n\nFor some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode. To do this, go to the Meta developer page and change your account to a developer account. Then go to the smartphone app under Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Developer Settings and activate developer mode.\n\n**Tip 12: Controller Shortcuts**\n\nTo quickly take a photo of the current content of Quest 3, press the meta button on the right controller and the trigger button at the same time. The same thing works with video recordings; for this you also press the meta button but hold down the trigger a little longer. This also stops the recording. You can find the results if you press the camera symbol.\n\n**Tip 13: SideQuest + AppLab**\n\nTo access even more apps that are not in the official Meta Store, you can use the SideQuest PC software to install additional apps from the AppLab or APK files on your Quest 3. I made a [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY) about this.\n\n**Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC**\n\nYou can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless. I also made a [tutorial video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/14N78C3HtMU) about this.\n\n**Tip 15: Improve video recordings**\n\nThe Quest 3 can record video of the currently displayed content by going to the menu, clicking the camera icon, and then clicking Record Video.\n\nBut to set the recording quality and format, you have to go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Camera. Here you can make various recording settings.\n\n**Tip 16: Count calories**\n\nIf you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.\n\n**Tip 17: Watch films**\n\nYou can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3's integrated player. 3D films are also supported.\n\n**Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking**\n\nIf you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&gt; Motion Tracking -&gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.\n\n**Tip 19: Play in complete darkness**\n\nThe Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking. However, if you still want to use it in complete darkness, you will need infrared lights. A small module that you can plug directly into Quest 3 is available for purchase; you can find the link in the description. https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC\n\n**Tip 20: Save battery**\n\nTo extend the battery life of the Quest 3, you can, for example, switch off the WIFI function in the Quest 3 menu for single-player games. An extended battery mode can also be activated, which reduces the brightness, resolution and FPS to save battery. You can find this in the settings under System -&gt; Energy settings there you activate the \u201cextra battery mode\u201d.\n\n**Tip 21: Privacy settings**\n\nYou can adjust your Quest 3 privacy. Here you can, for example, set who sees your activities, create a private profile, manage device and app permissions or even assign a password to individual apps. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Privacy.\n\n**Tip 22: Smartphone notifications**\n\nYou can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &gt; Devices &gt; Meta Quest 3 &gt; Headset Settings &gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.\n\n**Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard**\n\nYou can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.\n\n**Tip 24: Multitasking**\n\nYou can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.\n\n**Tip 25: Do not disturb**\n\nIf you don't want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.\n\n**Tip 26: App sharing**\n\nIf you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing. To do this, your friend must log in to your app under Settings and Account with their meta account on your Quest 3. You then activate app sharing in the same menu. Your friend will then have access to your game library on his Quest 3. Unfortunately, multiplayer games don't work with this.\n\n**Tip 27: Cross Buy List**\n\nSome games that you purchased from the Meta PC Store will automatically be available on your Quest 3 as standalone versions and vice versa, without you having to purchase them again. The games that support this are shown in a [list by Meta](https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/). \n\n**Tip 28: Save with referral links**\n\nIf your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app -&gt; click on the three dots -&gt; then send referral link. You send the link to your friend, who then buys the game using it.\n\n**Tip 29: Install apps from your smartphone**\n\nYou can easily install apps on the Quest 3 from your smartphone. To do this, go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select the game in the Meta smartphone app and then \u201cInstall to Headset\u201d.\n\n**Tip 30: Create an avatar**\n\nYou can create your own avatar for your meta account, which your friends can also see if you invite them to your home environment, for example. To do this, simply click on the mirror in your home environment and a window will open in which you can customize your avatar. You can turn the avatar mirror on and off in the settings under Personalization -&gt; Interactive Objects.\n\n**Tip 31: Activate passthrough mode quickly**\n\nTo activate the passthrough mode, that is the view of your real environment through the Quest 3, simply double-tap your hand against the Quest 3. If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.\n\n**Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes**\n\nThere are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly. The easiest, but least accurate, method is to use a ruler. It's better to have an app for your smartphone to measure the distance. You can find the link in the description. The safest method, however, is to go to an optician and have the distance measured. They often do this for free and it only takes a few seconds.\n\n**Tip 33: Disable Guardian System**\n\nIf you want to deactivate the Quest 3 security system, for example if you want to cover a larger area or for mixed reality apps, first activate the developer mode, I have already explained this to you in Tip 11. Then go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Developer and deactivate the guardian. However, be very careful when deactivating this security system!\n\n**Tip 34: WebVR games**\n\nYou can also play VR games with the Quest 3 via the built-in browser. To do this, open it and see a list of apps. In the \u201cBest of the Immersive Web\u201d category there are some good games and some free ones too. It takes a while for the games to start and you have to give the browser permission to start immersive apps.\n\n**Tip 35: Copy files from Quest 3**\n\nTo copy files from your Quest 3 to the PC, connect them to the PC with a USB-C cable. Then you have to confirm a dialog in Quest 3 and the file browser on the PC opens. You can find the recordings under Oculus-&gt;Videoshots, for example. Attention, the confirmation message no longer appears in Do Not Disturb mode!\n\n**Tip 36: Give help to beginners**\n\nIf you want to show Quest 3 to a friend and he is a complete beginner, you can support him during his VR session by, for example, starting apps via your smartphone. To do this, go to the smartphone app, then go to Menu -&gt; My Library -&gt; select an installed game and click \u201cStart\u201d. You can provide even more help by streaming the Quest 3 content to your phone. To do this, click on \u201cStream\u201d in the smartphone app under Menu -&gt; Devices -&gt; Meta Quest 3 -&gt;, select Meta Quest 3 again and press \u201cStart\u201d. Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.\n\n**Tip 37: Use hand straps**\n\nIt can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment. Especially when you throw things around in VR, you might end up throwing the controller into your window or the TV. It is therefore essential to always use the hand straps on the controllers, even if it means a few seconds more preparation time.\n\n**Tip 38: Change your virtual environment**\n\nYou can change the default home environment and, for example, beam yourself into a cyber city. To do this, go to Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Virtual Environment and select a different environment. If you scroll all the way down, you can even use your own 360 degree image as your home environment.\n\n**Tip 39: Check for updates**\n\nYour Quest 3 does not always install the updates automatically. To check whether there is a new update, go to Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Software Update. If an update is available here, it will be offered to you. Also activate the option \u201cAutomatically turn on the headset for updates\u201d to always have the latest updates, even if the quest is turned off.\n\n**Tip 40: Accessories**\n\nAs accessories, I can recommend the VR Cover for the facial interface, the original Elite Strap with battery or the M3 Pro Set from BoboVR. The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.\n\nIf you have time, I made a [20min video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs) about those tipps and tricks as well.  \nI hope there are some useful things for you in this list.  \nCheers  \nThomas","author_fullname":"t2_suryn","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"40 META QUEST 3 Tips And Tricks For Beginners And Pros","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"seagreen","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17fa4w2","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Tips &amp; Tricks","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1698145485.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;br\/&gt;\nI spent many days (and nights) to gather some cool tips and tricks for the Quest 3, here you go:  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 1: Casting to other devices&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By clicking on the camera button in the Quest 3 menu, you can stream the current view of Quest 3 to a TV, a browser or your cell phone so that your friends can watch you play. If your television doesn&amp;#39;t support this, you can, for example, buy a Chromecast stick that you plug into your television.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 2: Set Quest 3 to factory settings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your VR headset no longer work at all, even after a restart, or you want to sell the headset and a reset via the app doesn&amp;#39;t work, you can perform a factory reset from recovery mode. To do this, turn off Quest 3 completely. Then press the on\/off button and volume down button at the same time for a few seconds until the Quest 3 switches on. When the Meta logo is displayed, release the keys. In the menu that appears, select Factory Reset.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 3: Reset view&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To reset the view of both your active app and the home menu, simply press and hold the meta button on the right controller for 2 seconds.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 4: Refund app purchases&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you purchased an app from the Meta Store, you can get a refund if you don&amp;#39;t like it if you have used the app for less than 2 hours and purchased it no more than 14 days ago. To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Purchase in your Meta app on your smartphone &amp;gt; Click on the three dots next to the app you want to return and then click on \u201cRequest a refund\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 5: Smoother display with 120Hz&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the home environment and some apps and games that support it with a smoother display, then activate the 120Hz mode. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Display and activate \u201c120Hz refresh rate\u201d. Please note that it requires a little more battery power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 6: Pair Quest Pro Controller&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have purchased the Quest Pro Controller (you can find the link in the description), you can pair it by going to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Controller in the smartphone app and then clicking \u201cPair new controller \u201c. Do this with both controllers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 7: Turn off automatic activation&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If it bothers you that the Quest 3 automatically turns on when you put it on, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Power Settings in the smartphone app and deactivate the \u201cAutomatic activation\u201d option.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 8: Avoid sunlight&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure that sunlight never shines on the lenses of your VR headset, even for a few seconds. The lenses are basically magnifying glasses and they can burn your display. It is therefore best not to use it outside or leave it near a window.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 9: Avoid motion sickness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are a VR beginner or generally prone to motion sickness, check how intensive the app is before you buy an app in the store. Green means comfortable, you can&amp;#39;t get sick, but you should be more careful with the orange or even red category.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 10: Room scan with furniture&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can scan your entire room or even your entire apartment to prepare it for mixed reality apps. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Physical Room -&amp;gt; Set Up Room in Quest 3. Then scan your room. You can even place additional furniture such as tables and shelves, which can then also be used for mixed reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 11: Developer Mode&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For some things (like sideloading) you need a developer account and mode. To do this, go to the Meta developer page and change your account to a developer account. Then go to the smartphone app under Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Developer Settings and activate developer mode.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 12: Controller Shortcuts&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To quickly take a photo of the current content of Quest 3, press the meta button on the right controller and the trigger button at the same time. The same thing works with video recordings; for this you also press the meta button but hold down the trigger a little longer. This also stops the recording. You can find the results if you press the camera symbol.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 13: SideQuest + AppLab&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To access even more apps that are not in the official Meta Store, you can use the SideQuest PC software to install additional apps from the AppLab or APK files on your Quest 3. I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/bX5qC_QdqrY\"&gt;video&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 14: Access thousands more VR games via PC&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also connect the Quest 3 to a gaming PC and play all PCVR games from the Meta PC Store or Steam. This can be done via cable or wireless. I also made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/14N78C3HtMU\"&gt;tutorial video&lt;\/a&gt; about this.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 15: Improve video recordings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 can record video of the currently displayed content by going to the menu, clicking the camera icon, and then clicking Record Video.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But to set the recording quality and format, you have to go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Camera. Here you can make various recording settings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 16: Count calories&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you use the Meta Quest 3 as a fitness device, you can display an app overlay that shows you your current calorie status. To do this, install the Move app from the library, set it up with your values and start it. You can then view the statistics in the smartphone app.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 17: Watch films&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can watch films on Quest 3. This can be done, for example, with the apps Skyplayer, Bigscreen, a virtual cinema, with Virtual Desktop, which you can also use to stream films from your PC, or simply with the Quest 3&amp;#39;s integrated player. 3D films are also supported.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 18: Switch between controller and hand tracking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to switch between controller and hand tracking, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Motion Tracking -&amp;gt; Hand Tracking and activate \u201cHand and Body Tracking\u201d. You can also activate automatic switch here, then the Quest 3 automatically switches to hand tracking when you put the controllers down.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 19: Play in complete darkness&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 requires light to enable good tracking. However, if you still want to use it in complete darkness, you will need infrared lights. A small module that you can plug directly into Quest 3 is available for purchase; you can find the link in the description. &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC\"&gt;https:\/\/amzn.eu\/d\/7cxTGxC&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 20: Save battery&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To extend the battery life of the Quest 3, you can, for example, switch off the WIFI function in the Quest 3 menu for single-player games. An extended battery mode can also be activated, which reduces the brightness, resolution and FPS to save battery. You can find this in the settings under System -&amp;gt; Energy settings there you activate the \u201cextra battery mode\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 21: Privacy settings&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can adjust your Quest 3 privacy. Here you can, for example, set who sees your activities, create a private profile, manage device and app permissions or even assign a password to individual apps. To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Privacy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 22: Smartphone notifications&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can display notifications from your smartphone in the Quest 3. To do this, go to Menu &amp;gt; Devices &amp;gt; Meta Quest 3 &amp;gt; Headset Settings &amp;gt; Phone Notifications in the Meta smartphone app and activate it there.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 23: Connect mouse and keyboard&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can connect a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard to the Quest 3 to use the web browser. To do this, go to the settings under Bluetooth and add the relevant devices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 24: Multitasking&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can use 3 apps at the same time on the Quest 3. To do this, simply hold down an app with the trigger and drag it to a free app space.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 25: Do not disturb&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t want to be disturbed at all during your VR session, you can switch on Do Not Disturb mode in the settings under Notifications.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 26: App sharing&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to share your game library with a family member or friend, you can do this with App Sharing.

The games that support this are shown in a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.meta.com\/experiences\/section\/2335732183153590\/\"&gt;list by Meta&lt;\/a&gt;. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 28: Save with referral links&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your friend buys a game using your referral link, they save 25% and you get \u20ac5 for the meta store.

If the setting is not activated, do this in the settings under Physical Space -&amp;gt; Passthrough and activate \u201cDouble tap for passthrough\u201d.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 32: Measure the distance between your eyes&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are several methods to measure the distance between your eyes, which you have to adjust in Quest 3 with the small wheel under your headset in order to see everything clearly.

Then you can see on your smartphone what is currently being displayed in Quest 3 and you can also start apps, activate passthrough or reset the view.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 37: Use hand straps&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It can happen incredibly quickly that you become so immersed in your VR experience that you forget the real environment.

To do this, go to Settings -&amp;gt; Personalization -&amp;gt; Virtual Environment and select a different environment. If you scroll all the way down, you can even use your own 360 degree image as your home environment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 39: Check for updates&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your Quest 3 does not always install the updates automatically. To check whether there is a new update, go to Settings -&amp;gt; System -&amp;gt; Software Update. If an update is available here, it will be offered to you. Also activate the option \u201cAutomatically turn on the headset for updates\u201d to always have the latest updates, even if the quest is turned off.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip 40: Accessories&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As accessories, I can recommend the VR Cover for the facial interface, the original Elite Strap with battery or the M3 Pro Set from BoboVR. The AMVR Battery Strap, which you hang around your shoulder, might also be interesting for some people.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have time, I made a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9lOdqDLmaFs\"&gt;20min video&lt;\/a&gt; about those tipps and tricks as well.&lt;br\/&gt;\nI hope there are some useful things for you in this

This is my first post actually.\n\nI have a fairly new Oculus Quest 2, fully up to date, and have zero issues with any other apps (other than the device itself can be slow to download stuff at times even though I have an excellent WiFi connection to ultrafast internet).\n\nA friend invited me to play Vegas Infinite (formerly known as PokerStars VR, I understand). I have had an extremely frustrating experience with this game. It's been now about 2 weeks since I've initially installed this game on my device and I can't get past the login screens.\n\nSince I've installed the game there have been 3 major updates. The last 2 occurred in the last 3 days or so, the first one was about a 3GB update, and then another one today, which was 1.7GB in size. I hoped on any of those updates that they would resolve my issue, but they have not. I basically cannot play this game on the VR headset. So, having STEAM, I logged in using STEAM. From there I was able to link my e-mail account to the account, and I CAN play the game on STEAM, but that's not what I want to do. I want to play it on the VR!\n\nAnyway, here is the issue, in detail, that I'm having:\n\nWhen I load the game in VR, the main screen loads, which gives me the option of \"PLAY\", in a big, blank gray square option on the left side, or \"Login\", on the big square option on the right side, which has the Vegas Infinite logo, and my e-mail address, since it is now linked.\n\nIf I click on the \"login\" option, it blinks while I click the trigger, but nothing happens. Over and over I can click it and it does not respond other than the \"blink\" from squeezing the trigger.\n\nIf I select the gray \"PLAY\" option on the left side, then the swirly infinity symbol appears and spins around, and then the Vegas Infinite logo appears. Underneath the logo, a statement says \"You are now joining a table with a streamer. Behave yourself.\"\n\nAnd then it hangs. Nothing happens after that, no matter how long I wait, and no button functions. I have to force close the app to get out of it.\n\nSo. Below the \"login\" option, there is the option that says \"Email already linked? Join with name and password\". If you click that option, a username and password page shows up with a virtual keyboard.\n\nSo, I try putting in my email address and password, and click the action button (I think it says \"join\"). And... nothing happens. If I click it a second time too quickly, it will say \"Error. Try again in 4 seconds\". After a second or two it disappears, and if I click \"join\" again, then again, nothing happens. Etc.\n\nSo this is my experience with the game in VR. EXTREMELY frustrating. To the right at all times on either of those screens is the \"need support\" button, which if you click on it, it gives you a website to go to for support. That address is a weird address for some reason, a lovely thing to deal with when wearing your VR headset, but it ports to [support.vegasinfinite.com](https:\/\/support.vegasinfinite.com\/).\n\nFrom there, it has been another excruciatingly frustrating experience... they take DAYS to get back to you. I sent them an e-mail explaining what I just explained above. After THREE DAYS they responded with \"what's your username\"? Even though in the e-mail, I provided them with my e-mail address, which is unique. So, I replied with my username, and again confirmed my e-mail address to them for the account. I also updated them that I could in fact log in with STEAM, although that's not what I want to do. After another FOUR DAYS they responded with \"There are multiple users using that username (they allow multiple people to have the same username?!!! WHY?!), and they wanted my \"account balance and how many coins I have\". I don't even know what they mean by \"coins\" because I am new to the game! So, I replied to them with my account balance and what I THINK are my \"coins\", which I think have the infinite logo next to a number. That was FOUR DAYS AGO, and I still don't have a reply. So I'm into this tech support e-mail chain over a WEEK and they still haven't even \"verified\" my account to troubleshoot the issue with me. I mean... I've dealt with support people from India and China with people who can barely speak English and gotten better customer service than I'm getting from these people. They obviously don't care, and I think they are stalling because I think they know damn well what the problem is and they don't have a solution to the problem. Oh yes. I should note: YES, I have tried completely uninstalling and re-installing the game several times. Verifying all files were deleted. That didn't do anything to fix this problem. And, as I said, I am NOT having any issues with any other apps on my Oculus. JUST THIS ONE.\n\nSo. Anyone else having this same issue? Do you also have an Oculus?\n\nOh. I guess I should note, that my friend that invited me to play this... has had the game on his Oculus Quest 2 for quite a while, I think he started playing it before it was called Vegas Infinite, and he does not have any problems logging into his game.","author_fullname":"t2_lredetkq2","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Problems with Oculus playing Vegas Infinite","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"purple","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_177vdo3","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Software","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1697306922.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.oculus","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this in \/VRGaming as well but not sure that was the right spot so posting it here as well, hope that is ok.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m new to Reddit so may not be searching correctly, but I can&amp;#39;t find much info about this issue so am posting here.

That address is a weird address for some reason, a lovely thing to deal with when wearing your VR headset, but it ports to &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/support.vegasinfinite.com\/\"&gt;support.vegasinfinite.com&lt;\/a&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, it has been another excruciatingly frustrating experience... they take DAYS to get back to you. I sent them an e-mail explaining what I just explained above. After THREE DAYS they responded with &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s your username&amp;quot;? Even though in the e-mail, I provided them with my e-mail address, which is unique. So, I replied with my username, and again confirmed my e-mail address to them for the account. I also updated them that I could in fact log in with STEAM, although that&amp;#39;s not what I want to do. After another FOUR DAYS they responded with &amp;quot;There are multiple users using that username (they allow multiple people to have the same username?!!! WHY?!), and they wanted my &amp;quot;account balance and how many coins I have&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t even know what they mean by &amp;quot;coins&amp;quot; because I am new to the game! So, I replied to them with my account balance and what I THINK are my &amp;quot;coins&amp;quot;, which I think have the infinite logo next to a number. That was FOUR DAYS AGO, and I still don&amp;#39;t have a reply. So I&amp;#39;m into this tech support e-mail chain over a WEEK and they still haven&amp;#39;t even &amp;quot;verified&amp;quot; my account to troubleshoot the issue with me. I mean... I&amp;#39;ve dealt with support people from India and China with people who can barely speak English and gotten better customer service than I&amp;#39;m getting from these people. They obviously don&amp;#39;t care, and I think they are stalling because I think they know damn well what the problem is and they don&amp;#39;t have a solution to the problem. Oh yes. I should note: YES, I have tried completely uninstalling and re-installing the game several times. Verifying all files were deleted. That didn&amp;#39;t do anything to fix this problem. And, as I said, I am NOT having any issues with any other apps on my Oculus. JUST THIS ONE.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So. Anyone else having this same issue? Do you also have an Oculus?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh. I guess I should note, that my friend that invited me to play this... has had the game on his Oculus Quest 2 for quite a while, I think he started playing it before it was called Vegas Infinite, and he does not have any problems logging into his game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"4c9ef228-aec0-11e3-923d-12313d0901f7","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"177vdo3","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Vap0r1970","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/177vdo3\/problems_with_oculus_playing_vegas_infinite\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/177vdo3\/problems_with_oculus_playing_vegas_infinite\/","subreddit_subscribers":487478,"created_utc":1697306922.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"oculus","selftext":"So as a sim gamer, I often keep controllers to the side and use just mouse and keyboard inbetween drives\/flights.

Contacting oculus support (good but didn&amp;#39;t help) well it helped for a month or 2 until a oculus app update came and made it worse.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve turned off &amp;quot;let the pc turn off this device to save power&amp;quot; on all USBs. I&amp;#39;ve don&amp;#39;t everything in my power to fix the app and nothing work. And after uninstalling the oculus app some USB issues still occur. The only way that I know to fix this is A FRESH INSTALL OF WINDOWS. I had a point where my USBs would go out every like 10 minutes or so I check event viewer FUCKING 4000 ERROS MADE OF JUST UBS SHIT and it was unique errors every time. (This only starts happening when using the oculus app)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if one of these USB disconnects happen it permenetly disconnects it until you ethier unplug and plug in back in the keyboard and mouse and stuff or restart you pc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the first time I incounterd with one of these USB disconnects I though nothing of it, it kept happening later on so I check event viewer and see, like USB connection errors. I tried to do some like USB fixing stuff on device manager nothing worked it still happened. I ended up getting a fresh copy of windows 10.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 week goes by and I want to play some vr on f1 2022 I got a steering wheel to play with and it was fun. Until I stop playing and started playing pc fps games. In a match BOOM USB disconnects, forgot to mention this disconnects my mic, keyboard, mouse, camera ligit every thing that is plugged in except the monitors and audio.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a idea of checking event viewer again and see USB errors.

I don't know a lot about tech and bought the quest for my kids for Christmas (they are young, 7 and 9). My 7 year old gets very upset when he hears the N word and he apparently \"VR punched\" someone in Horizons when was just repeating the N word over and over. He immediately got suspended for that, but now we can't log in and play any of the other games, literally thousands of dollars of games and in-game purchases? Is this really a legit thing? There is absolutely no way that can be legal. I'll be buying another VR headset, but in the meantime is there a way to get around it so the kids can play their other games?

It worked for a couple days no problem, and then I started tweaking some of my in game strings, oculus debug tool, and nvidia settings to get a better performance in iRacing. After this it started freezing randomly. I emailed oculus support and requested a call back. They called me a few hours later and after about an hour of trouble shooting nothing worked. I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has ever had this problem and would know how to fix it, or if anyone has an idea on what could be the problem. Below is the trouble shooting methods I tried \n\nUpdating drivers \n\nUninstalling intel drivers I had installed for some reason \n\nHere\u2019s the methods I got from oculus\n\nAfter reviewing the log files, I see that there are some updates needed which can cause the issue you are experiencing.\n \nCheck for any pending Windows updates (even optional ones) by visiting the Microsoft website here.\nUpdate your graphics card drivers by following the direct link to the manufacturers website\nClick here for the NVIDIA driver update page: GeForce Game Ready Driver\n\nIf you are using Oculus Tray Tool or other third party software that can make modifications to graphics or settings, please uninstall for troubleshooting purposes as these programs can cause conflicts that effect performance and display.\n \nPlease disconnect any extra devices connected to the PC leaving only the product hardware, mouse, keyboard and one primary monitor\nThe next thing that I would like to ask is to check if Game Mode is enabled on your system. Follow the steps below:\n \nOpen the Windows Settings menu\nClick on Gaming\nClick Game Mode\nToggle Game Mode off if it\u2019s turned on\n \nIf you require further assistance with any of these steps, you can receive chat support by clicking here and selecting the chat button in the bottom right corner.\nKindly enable the Public Test Channel: \n \nOpen the Oculus app on your PC computer.\nSelect Settings in the left menu.\nSelect the Beta tab.\nNext to Public Test Channel, click to enroll.\n \nOnce you are able to complete these updates, let me know the results.

This makes Beat Saber a lot more fun with friends. This guide glosses over some of the details; you can find better details via Google for some specific things. I'm tired and I'm typing most of this from memory.\n\n1. Connect your Steam Deck to your TV using an HDMI dongle; preferably a hub with USB ports and stuff, like the official dock. Get the picture up and running and get a mouse and keyboard before proceeding.\n2. In Steam Deck's display settings make sure your TV is set as the primary monitor (this ensures you get a full screen image).\n3. Install Sidequest on your Steam Deck. This can be done in Desktop mode via the web browser. Just go to Sidequest's website, download the \"advanced\" version, then extract the resulting archive and run the file named \"sidequest\". (You can also right click this, copy the path to it, then create a new link on your desktop so you don't have to go find it again.)\n4. With Sidequest running, do all the stuff required to connect your Quest 2 via a cable. There's a whole process that Sidequest tries to walk you through. Once you've done the configuration it's plug-n-play after that.\n5. After you're fully connected, click the WiFi icon on the top right of the Sidequest window, then follow the prompts to connect wirelessly to the Quest 2. Once you're connected you can pop the cable loose. I'm pretty sure this process just runs some adb commands that you might find in other instructionals; fine with me, I prefer not to type them.\n6. Install guiscrcpy from Discover, and launch it. You should see your Quest 2 listed. There's a little field where you can add additional scrcpy parameters (scrcpy is the app this one is based on). In that field, put this text: `--crop 1600:900:2017:510`\n7. Uncheck all the options for status bars and whatnot, and select the Fullscreen option. (Alt-F3 will enable the menu later if you need it; Alt-F4 will quit the cast.) I keep the bitrate at default and I set the resolution to about 1000px (I think?).\n8. At this point you should be able to select your Quest 2 then click the Start button, and the casting should begin. It didn't work the first time for me; I may have repeated some of the steps and then suddenly it was working great.\n\nThe first time you do all that stuff it's a bit of a headache. But you'll have less to do next time around:\n\n1. Launch Sidequest\n2. Plug in cable, switch to wireless mode, unplug\n3. Launch guiscrcpy\n4. Click the Start button\n\nThis feature is video-only, so you'll want to crank up the volume on your Quest 2 or maybe figure out how to connect it to a bluetooth speaker.\n\nPro tip: I found this process much easier after I ripped off a tiny piece of sticky note and covered up the between-the-eyes sensor on the Quest 2. I don't know why it so aggressively blanks the display when you remove it; it already has a \"no activity\" timeout that makes this mostly redundant anyway.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"oculus","subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","subreddit_subscribers":475125,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Low-latency wireless casting to your TV via Steam Deck","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.67,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/11nhx1m\/lowlatency_wireless_casting_to_your_tv_via_steam\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"TurfMerkin","author_created_utc":1593305821,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_72vjzvt5","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":true,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1677926809,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.oculus","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"11hwfnr","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"purple","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"4c9ef228-aec0-11e3-923d-12313d0901f7","link_flair_text":"Software","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_11hwfnr","no_follow":true,"num_comments":6,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/11hwfnr\/looking_for_assistance_with_assetto_corsa_via\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1681021163,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Having just purchased AC, I\u2019m having trouble with the experience in VR.

For me as a leftie it's the correct use of left handed support but VR and left handed support is a hole that goes way deeper.\n\nIn this thread I try to explain the struggle for left handed players in the VR universe and how those problems might be solved.\n\nAs experience told me many developers don't think of left handed support at all and even with left handed developers on the team it often is for one or another leftie the wrong implementation.\n\nThere are a few variations of left handed players to begin with:- Lefties like me that wants to have inputs (and sticks) swapped\n\n\\- Lefties that are used to non-vr gamepad controls and able to play with right handed layout\n\n\\- And even right handed players that want to swap sticks, so movement is on the right controller.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what exactly is left handed support? For many it's just \"Why? You can hold the item\/weapons with the left hand.\" That is true but that's not left handed support and just \"normal\" VR interaction where you always should be able to interact with both hands. If your item\/weapon is hardcoded to the right hand, then a **part** of left handed support would be swapping hands. If it's a shooter or you have an inventory things like ammo pouch, shoulder position for melee weapons, watches or tables should swap accordingly.\n\nFor those things you have to remember, we lefties use our **dominant** hand. And often the those points of interaction on the body are made for right handed players that have...wel a right dominant hand. Therefore this should be an option inside the game for itself.\n\nNow let's get to movement and actions (jumping, crouch, use, ect.). I myself play shooters on consoles too and there I play with the default right handed layout but in VR it's a complete different beast. My head and muscles just go into sync and it feels simply wrong. Reading the before mentioned post other lefties don't think that way. But there are plenty that feel the way I do. So what could we do to solve that?\n\nAt the moment or the way I always saw and still see button layouts in VR are as follows:- main hand -&gt; turning (right stick for right handed, left stick for left handed)\n\n\\- off-hand -&gt; movement (left stick for right handed, right stick for left handed)\n\nOn top actions like jumping and crouchin should be swapped too, because if you only swap sticks and I want to move with the right stick, jumping is still on the right controller. Impossible to use both at the same time.\n\nPersonally I can't play if movement is on the left stick because with controller directional movement and aiming at the same time I would constantly move left and right and hard to keep a straight direction I want to go. That's why movement should be on the off-hand at least for me personally.\n\nThe easiest way to experience the struggle of plenty lefties like me. Play in left handed mode (where movement is on the right controller) and feel it for yourself.\n\nI hope this gives you developers an idea that left handed isn't just left handed. So what could be the solution?\n\nSimple put, as many accessibility options as possible.\n\n\\- seperate option for swap sticks\n\n\\- seperate options for swap inputs (jumping, crouching, use, etc.)\n\n\\- option to swap layout on player character (position of weapon, ammo, tools, etc. on body)\n\n\\- when items\/weapons are hardcored onto one hand, an option to swap hands. Or how many devs do with the option \"choose dominant hand\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end agressivly complaining \"I want this\/I don't want that\" doesn't fix it. Yes it might fix it for that one group of lefties, but there is the other group that might want those options.\n\nAccessibility has to improve in VR. Where rebindable keys on keyboard or buttons on gamepad are common and standart in non-vr games, those options should come to VR too. If this happens everyone can play to their liking.\n\nI really hope some developers might read this because VR gaming can be very frustrating as a left handed player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n(sorry for possible typos. English is not my main language)  \n\n\nEdit:   \nForgot one solution that was mentioned in the comments:  \n\n\n\\- Meta adding those swap\/input functions directly in their OS like it's already done with for example SteamVR controller settings.  \n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"oculus","subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","subreddit_subscribers":472429,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Dear (solo) developers, let us talk about left handed support","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/10gxvnb\/dear_solo_developers_let_us_talk_about_left\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Better-Librarian7997","author_created_utc":1602978630,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_73fxslrf","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1674045834,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.oculus","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10f6im8","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10f6im8","no_follow":true,"num_comments":11,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/10f6im8\/the_quest_pro_controller_straps_specifically_are\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676235996,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Why have I seen no one else complain about these poorly designed wrist straps that the new quest pro controllers come with and the only reason that they made them detachable is so that you will eventually have to buy replacements, which you *will* have to buy because they are such a tacky material and feel gross to play anything sweaty like Beatsaber or Creed. I've had mine like what a month and a bit maybe two? The thing that locks them to your wrists already doesn't hold itself anymore which leaves them loose and hitting my wrist when I play games like Beatsaber. Them also being rectangular in nature than the rope-like cylinder ones of the original controllers make them incredibly annoying to actually put on properly without them feeling tangled or inside out. The feeling of them also just feels so, plastic-y(?) I'm not sure how to put it they just don't feel good to wear. Now I just have to buy new ones which I don't even think I can yet???

Close the Oculus app.\n2. Press the **Windows key + R** on your keyboard to open the **Run** command box.\n3. Enter **C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Oculus\\\\Support\\\\oculus-drivers**\n4. Open **oculus-driver**\n5. Open the Oculus app and then try to connect your headset again.\n\n* Unplug all USB devices from your computer except for your keyboard, mouse, and headset.\n* Plug your headset USB cable in to the back of your PC, not the front or anywhere else.\n* Disable USB Selective Suspend Setting:\n\n1. right-click **Start**\n2. click **Power Options**\n3. click **Additional Power Settings**\n4. click **Change plan settings**\n5. click **Change Advanced Power Settings**\n6. find **USB Settings**\n7. make sure that **Selective Suspend Setting** is set to **Disabled**\n\n* Ensure that USB power saving settings in **Windows Device Manager** are not enabled for your USB ports:\n\n1. right-click the **Windows Start** button and open **Device Manager**\n2. find your USB ports\n3. right-click and select **Properties**\n4. go to **Power Management**\n5. make sure that options to save power are deselected (please note that it is normal that some of them will not have any checkbox for power saving settings).\n6. repeat this for each of the listed USB ports\n\nOnce all that has been confirmed, please restart your computer.  \nYou should also uninstall the PC app completely and reinstall a new setup that can be downloaded [here](https:\/\/store.facebook.com\/quest\/setup\/).\u00a0  \nTo completely uninstall the app:  \n1: Uninstall oculus using the setup\/installer.  \n2: in your local disk, program files\/program files x## delete the \"oculus\" folder.  \n3: go to in File Explorer, then users&gt;your name&gt;%appdata%.  \n4: in all 3 folders \"Roaming\", \"Local\" and \"Local Low\", delete all \"Oculus\" folders and also \"Oculusclient\" folders if present.  \n5: restart the PC.  \n6: get a fresh new oculus setup installer from the oculus website and run it and install.  \nInstall the oculus software with both wires in the whole time while uninstalling, restarting and fresh installing.   \n\n\nHope this fix works for everyone else! I've never had a support agent from ANY brand give me steps that I hadn't already tried. Most of the time they give me steps to do something I literally already told them I tried, and usually multiple times at that. This is a big first!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"oculus","subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","subreddit_subscribers":470234,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"FIX

And after seeing that post it inspired me to talk to Oculus myself. \n\nAfter 3 days of emailing back and forth with customer support, last night they agreed to fulfill my RMA request so I should be getting a new cable in the mail in a few weeks :)\n\n Anyway, to get down to the bulk of how I did it  [This link will take you to the oculus rift support page on meta's support website](https:\/\/store.facebook.com\/help\/support\/quest\/product\/2563666403961687\/)\n\nAfter you click through the menus you should be given an option to either chat, email or have a phone call from someone from Meta. All of my communication with meta was between their chat client and email. \n\nAfter I got in touch with someone from meta they asked me some simple questions about what was wrong with it.  \n \nSupport guy then asked me to take pictures of the cable, all the connectors, and any visible damage\n\nAnd finally for the diagnostic phase they asked for some oculus logs through software meta has installed to the oculus files, I had to do this twice, the second time I had to unplug everything from my computer  that wasn't a keyboard, mouse, my VR headset, and a monitor and also make sure all my device drivers were up to date. \n\nAfter the diagnostic phase was done all **they needed was the Headset serial number AND the serial number of the box it came in, and the original purchasing invoice\/receipt** (this is why I prefaced by post by saying if you bought a refurbished rift, you probably can't get an RMA cable, having the box, and original invoice is probably not something most are buying when buying a refurbished rift) \n\nWithin a few minutes of sending that  + shipping information, I got an email from their RMA team saying they were processing my request and it should be shipped out in a few days :) \n\nAll CV1s should be out of warranty by now, getting a new cable from meta support, in theory, should be easier than ever assuming they have a decent supply of them as any left are probably just taking up space. \n\nHope this helps anyone with a rift CV1 :)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"oculus","subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","subreddit_subscribers":470245,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Now may be a good time to request an RMA with meta support for CV1 cables (detailed instructions within on how to get a replacement for original rift cv1 owners)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/zmkn10\/now_may_be_a_good_time_to_request_an_rma_with\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"PossibleExamination1","author_created_utc":1596207585,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_59hc02xi","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1671047204,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.oculus","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"zm0ayg","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_zm0ayg","no_follow":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/zm0ayg\/go_straight_into_game\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1673184364,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I use my headset for nothing else but a display for when Im using my Racing sim.

That's when I knew it might be a bumpy ride.\n\nLet me get this out of the way, there is some real genius to this headset and then there's some questionable stupidity that over shadows it.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\nThe pancake lens' live up to the hype. They are legit amazing and super clear.\n\nThe return of proper IPD is great\n\nYou can wear glasses with this headset\n\nTracking is solid and the controllers track much better\n\nAudio is improved in the speakers\n\nEye tracking is super accurate in the set up system\n\nHand tracking is improved\n\nColor pass through is nice\n\nThe docking station is actually nice to have but it's just another thing to figure out how to travel with... actually this might belong in the \"step backwards\" category...\n\nThe bad stuff:\n\n**Comfort** is a step backwards. Everyone wants to talk about the comfort and if you are still rocking a quest 2 with the jock strap... sure it is way better. But compared to the elite strap, it's a major step backwards IMHO. Headstraps need to have the top strap as at least an option. Not all foreheads are the same or that round at the back of your head. This strap will cause neck strain to a significant number of players, myself included. Not letting me have an option for the top strap to better distribute the weight, well... I guess it's good that battery sucks cause I won't be in the HMD for long sessions.\n\n**Battery** \\- uh... it's bad... it's like really bad. The controller batteries aren't much better. This goes back to the question about travel and portability. That charging station is going with you everywhere. For some reason they give you ONE usb charger for the controllers... let me repeat that for the low mathematicians in the back... you get ONE proprietary charging cable for your TWO controllers with your $1500 HMD. \\[To clarify\\] You can charge everything with the docking station... I just don't understand why you would supply only one backup cable for one controller, it just doesn't make sense.\n\n**Mixed Reality -** laughably bad... this is NOT a mixed reality headset. The passthrough camera is grainy. Look at the pass through in your Quest 2, imagine it 20% clearer and with color... that's it. The waviness is still there and it's just NOT what they sell in the video. It's not even 720 webcam quality.\n\n**Light leak -**  and here is where all common sense breaks apart. If you are going to make a proof of concept mixed reality headset into a commercial item, you better be darn sure it at least does the VR part better than your $400 counterpart. Even with the side blinders, this is pathetic. You get basically two sloppy attempts at something rather than 1 good something... and triple the price. Yes, there is a full face mask coming for $50... a month later. Can you imagine being the person in the office trying to explain this. Meta has to ship a crappy VR experience for their first premium price because they couldn't get rubber masks with a couple magnets in time. They got a whole new chip and lens' and cameras... but couldn't get a latex face mask? Congrats, you got a crap AR and a crappy VR headset out at launch at the same time. That is depressingly impressive.\n\nThe stupid stuff:\n\n**Packaging -**  at the start I warned that unboxing was a red flag. Fact is, everything in the box is the same color. It's surprisingly difficult to know if you have removed everything. I'm specifically talking about the stylus tips. They are so hidden that I'm certain people will think they are missing like I did or will get tossed by mistake. There was just no thought into the unboxing process or set up. Normally not a big deal, but it paved the way for a mediocre arrival.\n\n**Protector -**  the front is glass, so they supply a latex covering to protect it when traveling or not in use. But it covers the charging connectors, soooooo.\n\n**Build quality -** Lots of thin bendy plastic going on. It's too soon to say, but I see lots of repair requests in the Meta future.\n\n**No pad tilt -** pretty basic, the comfort pads don't adjust or tilt at all. Unless you have a Zuck shaped head, YMMV.\n\n**Software -** if you are going to make some killer features, ship it with a demo or something useful. The eye tracking works amazingly well and the only way I know this is because you can test it in the calibration. There's NOTHING that highlights the potential here. Same with face tracking... not even a mirror in the avatar creator. Literally could not be bothered to improve the avatar creator with all the bragging they did at release.\n\n**Horizons -** this is getting embarrassing. If anyone at Meta reads this and gets this far... here's the part you are missing and why Horizons is a let down for even VR noobs as soon as they open it. If your world building social platform looks WORSE than the pretty default world that you use your main menu in... you've lost. Nothing else matters. There's a ton wrong with Horizons but none of it matters if you can't clear that hurdle. It will always be seen as a step backwards.\n\n**The lying stuff:**\n\n**Workrooms -** All that multi screen \"office of the future talk\"... total bull crap if you are on a windows machine. Which the majority of Oculus early adopters, influencers, and developer\/designers are... seriously what in the world. If you ship this for enterprise without any actual enterprise solutions, what are you even doing here? Also, no keyboard support for the last couple years on the Mac Book Pro line??? seriously?\n\n**Demos** \\- Everything presented in their videos of the \"vision\" for the quest pro is a lie at launch. It's not real, the software doesn't exist, and somethings like improved AR passthrough are just flat out lies... kind of like the whole \"legs\" thing. Sure some stuff may come in time, but that's not how you sell a $1500 enterprise or creative tool at launch. All the marketing of the last 2 months just smacks of magic leap marketing tactics.\n\n**TLDR**: I can't suggest this headset over the Quest 2 and it has nothing to do with price. I know Meta has said who they intend this product to be for... I'm in that category. This was purchased by my company for me (thankfully) to use professionally. I don't like it. I can't use it... and I've owned every Oculus headset ever released. They can say who they WANT to use it... but this headset doesn't successfully target anyone. It's a mixed bag of brilliance and stupidity rushed out at a premium price. The Quest Pro makes no logical sense.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"oculus","subreddit_id":"t5_2uni5","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/oculus","subreddit_subscribers":463812,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"a negative Quest Pro review... who is the target market really?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/oculus\/comments\/ydlvsn\/a_negative_quest_pro_review_who_is_the_target\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"lollobis","author_created_utc":1558294619,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3sub3mhx","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1666287796,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.oculus","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"y94rgr","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"purple","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"4c9ef228-aec0-11e3-923d-12313d0901f7","link_flair_text":"Software","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_y94rgr","no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/oculus\/comments\/y94rgr\/any_virtual_keyboard_for_quest_2_hand_tracking\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1668027955,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I was wondering if there was a keyboard app that allows you to type normally using hand tracking.
