{"data":[{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Vive","selftext":"Hi all, I wanted to provide a review and some insights into my Quest 3, and more specifically how it compares to my HTC VIVE Pro 2. Both are high resolution headsets and I haven't seen many comparisons or answers to if it\u2019s worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to\/from. My intent isn\u2019t to compare the hard specs, anyone can easily Google the numerical differences, but instead look at the more qualitative aspects. As such, obviously all the below is my opinion and just how I feel, right or wrong. Also, if I missed something or there is anything you would like to know, just ask. Finally, my apologies if this post is long and rambly.\r  \n\r  \nJust some background on my reasons for purchasing the Quest. I previously lived in an apartment where I had a dedicated playspace to use the VIVE. However, last year I moved and my new place didn't have a convenient space to use the headset that was near my PC (I also got married and started a family, so space and time to play was very limited). So naturally, I stopped using the headset and it sat dormant for over a year. Fast forward to present day, the hype, specs, and reviews of the Quest 3 caught my attention, especially its ability to play PCVR anywhere with Air Link, so I talked myself into buying the headset. Prior to this, I had never seriously looked at Oculus headsets after Meta purchased them.\r  \n\r  \nMy VIVE setup: I purchased my HTC VIVE Pro 2 shortly after its release in June 2021. I have 4x HTC\/Valve base stations, 2 Valve knuckle controllers, and the HTC VIVE wireless adapter (I ran the headset both wired and wireless). FYI, I also had a Valve Index, but only for a very short period of time.\r  \n\r  \nMy Quest 3 setup: Quest 3 (128GB version), stock controllers, and using Air Link and standalone (I\u2019ve never tried the Link Cable).\r  \n\r  \nI use SteamVR for PCVR, running on a system with an RTX 3080, i7-10700, 32GB of memory, and 1TB M.2 NVMe. My network is ran on a WiFi-6 ASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8) mesh system.\r  \n\r  \nNow, let\u2019s get into the comparisons and my thoughts:\n\n# Lenses, Screens, &amp; Resolution\n\n\rThe Quest has pancake lenses while the VIVE has Fresnel lenses. The pancake lenses are amazing and all future headsets should have these. The clarity across the Quest\u2019s FOV is so much better compared to the VIVE. There is some slight blurriness at the edges and when moving my head. The Quest has a very large and forgiving sweetspot while the VIVE has a very small and unforgiving one; the VIVE gets blurry fast if you\u2019re slightly outside the sweetspot. From a purely performance perspective, if you're perfectly in the sweetspot, then I give the advantage to the VIVE, it\u2019s clear and able to pullout more details with its resolution...but you have to be perfectly in it to get that advantage. With the VIVE, I constantly found myself adjusting the headset\u2019s position on my face while in game, re-centering the sweetspot. I don\u2019t find myself doing this with the Quest. From actual real world usage, I get a great visual experience with the Quest, that is more enjoyable.\r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t notice any god rays or reflections on the Quest. Unfortunately, this is the VIVE\u2019s Achilles heel, the god rays\/reflections really take away from the high resolution and overall picture enjoyment. For both headsets, I didn\u2019t notice any screen door effect, mura, or aliasing (I\u2019ve seen others mention aliasing on the Quest due to the canted screen panels, but it hasn\u2019t been noticeable to me).\r  \n\r  \nInterestingly, with the Quest, I have a hard time focusing on objects held closer to the headset (not sure what the Quest\u2019s focal range is) and have a hard time with the vergence-accommodation conflict. Example, while playing Half-Life Alex, I am unable to read the labels on items that I am holding at arms length while having both eyes open. This was not an issue on the VIVE.\r  \n\r  \nI haven't noticed any dead pixels on either headset (I\u2019m not going out of my way to look for them, such as using solid color screens. If I don't notice it during normal usage, then I don\u2019t care, nor do I want to know it's there).\r  \n\r  \nFOV &amp; Binocular\/Stereo Overlap\r  \nThe VIVE has a wider FOV feeling compared to the Quest. However, due to my face shape, both headsets give me a wearing a scuba mask feel. On the Quest, I have the rye relief in the furthest out position to help with vergence-accommodation noted above (and due to some discomfort of the edges of the lens pushing on my nose), which cuts down on the FOV further and makes the scuba mask feeling more pronounced.\r  \n\r  \nBoth headsets have pretty poor binocular overlap, but it is a little less noticeable on the VIVE.\r  \n\r\n\n# Comfort\n\n\rThe VIVE is far more comfortable and I able have the lenses very close to my eyes without any issues. It\u2019s no contest, however, my hot take is I don't think the Quest\u2019s stock strap is as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It\u2019s not the best but it\u2019s also not this torture device its made out to be. My only issue is I get hotspot pressure points on the back of my head where the two adjustable sliders sit. I actually have more discomfort from the lens siting on the bridge of my nose, I have a narrow IPD of 59\/60, so the lenses are pretty close (I guess I have a wider nose as well). My only relief is to have the eye relief set to the furthest setting away from my face (which unfortunately narrows the FOV). The Quest\u2019s facial interface fabric seemed fine but its not as soft as the VIVE's.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*Note: I did try the BOBOVR halo strap, but I didn't find it comfortable and it seemed loose\/moved around too much for my liking (I hear this is common for halo style straps). I would tighten the strap down (a lot) to help, but then the pressure on my forehead painful. I know I\u2019m in the minority for this. I ended up returning it to Amazon. Funny\/odd thing with the BOBO, the color wasn\u2019t really white, it was more of a very light gray (haven't seen anyone else mention this). I recently ordered the official Meta Quest 3 Elite Strap. I find it far more comfortable. I recently saw Meta halted the sale of these due to battery issues...I haven\u2019t had an issue yet, but its something to be aware of.\r  \n\r\n\n# Controllers\n\n\rThis is a mixed bag when compared to the Valve knuckles. I really miss my knuckles. I feel they had better ergonomics, comfort, and were a joy to use. The straps that hold your hands to the controller, so you don\u2019t always have to grip the controller, are so comfortable (these should be standard on all controllers). The finger tracking is nice as it just feels more natural to use your hands\/fingers to grab and throw things without pushing a button. The only downside is the curved hand guards where the sensors are located; they are a bit big and will bang into one another when your hands a close together.\r  \n\r  \nI like that the Quest\u2019s controllers are smaller and don\u2019t interfere\/ knock into each other when the controllers are next to each other. I just wish they felt a little better in the hand, were more ergonomic, and had the same hand straps as Valve\u2019s. I know Meta sells aftermarket hand straps, but $40 for a piece of fabric and Velcro is absurd. I did try some cheaper ones from AMVR, but there is a metal disc on the top of the strap dug into my hand, making it uncomfortable; and the forced hand placement, when the straps were tightened, placed your fingers in odd position with regards to the buttons. Valve controllers addresses this by having three different adjustable angle settings for the straps (I cant find any Quest add-ons that does this).\r  \n\r\n\n# \rSoftware User Interface and Ease of Use\n\nMeta really nailed this, it just works and seems well put together. I haven\u2019t had any big breaking issues or ran into major glitches (every so often the menu screen\/tablet will appear 10 yards away from me, vice being next to me\/or where I left it previously). The interface doesn\u2019t seem bloated. Boundary setup was easy, and worked as intended. I really like when you break a boundary, the passthrough actives and you can see your actual room. My only annoyance is I can\u2019t permanently delete an app that I purchased\/downloaded to my library (I can only uninstall them). E.g. I downloaded the Beat Saber demo and later purchased the full game and for some reason, Meta wont let me permanently remove the demo from my library (the demo is always visible in my apps library, even though its uninstalled).\r  \n\r  \nRegarding SteamVR and the VIVE, I didn\u2019t have many issues, but there were more than a few times where I would have to reset my headset to be recognized, reload SteamVR, base stations not being recognized, and I would have to reestablish my playarea every couple days, etc. (small things that just added up). The playspace boundaries never worked quite right on my VIVE\/SteamVR; sometimes it would activate and sometimes it wouldn't. At the end of the day, I always seemed to be tinkering with the setup before I was able to get into VR (I realize this is one\u2019s \u201clot in life\u201d when they are an earlier adapter of new tech, but just comparing that to where we are now with the ease of Quest 3). I also now have a family, so between them and my work, I don't have a lot of time to game anymore. So when I do get a few minutes or hour to do so, the last thing I want to do is waste time trying to get it running. This is one of the best selling points for the Quest, it just works without any fuss.\r  \n\r\n\n# Air Link &amp; VIVE Wireless Adapter\n\n\rI originally bought the quest so I could play my PCVR library in a different room from my PC, and Air Link seemed like the answer. When Air Link works, its actually very impressive. It seems to have minimal compression and I hardly noticed any artifacts. But sometimes it will lag and the graphics look like shit, which causes me to change over to a standalone game. It\u2019s inconsistent (even when right next to my PC and router), so the issues may be due to interference from other devices\/busy times of the day.\r  \n\r  \nBesides this, the biggest issue I have with Air Link is connecting it to SteamVR. Sometime I can connect the Quest 3 quickly and be in my SteamVR \u201chome\u201d in minutes, while other times I have to restart\/reconnect the Quest to my PC or restart Steam (sometimes multiple times). I just can\u2019t get the connection process to be consistent. \\*EDIT: Just saw the Valve released a Steam Link app for the Quest, I\u2019ll start testing that shortly.\r  \n\r  \nThe VIVE wireless adapter is a mix bag. Unlike Air Link, I need to be near my PC for the VIVE wireless adapter to register. I never had issues with stuttering, lag, or the wireless adapter overheating. It worked exactly how HTC designed it to, although getting the HTC software to recognize it could be a chore. However, the biggest issue I had with it was the amount of compression; the graphics took too big of a hit for me. So I only used it for a short time before going back to wired. I was swapping between wired and wireless based on the game I was playing, but changing out the cords on the headset is a pain in the ass. At the end of the day, the VIVE Pro 2 visuals and resolution are meant for wired to get the most out of the headset graphically (it\u2019s really the reason why you would buy this headset in the first place). On any other prior VIVE headset, the wireless adapter would be acceptable and worth it.\n\n# \rPassthrough\n\n\rNever used it on the VIVE (never had a reason to). The passthrough on the Quest is really cool and has so much potential, and it\u2019s good enough for doing basic everyday things without needing to remove the headset. It\u2019s one of the features that I was really intrigued and excited about, however, I feel that reviewers (especially VR YouTube reviewers that I follow), over-hyped and over sold it\u2019s capability. The passthrough is very grainy and has a lot of noise, and the warping near edges of items can be nauseating. I\u2019ve tried the Quest in different lighting, outside (careful to avoid direct sunlight on the inside lenses), in my kitchen, and living room and can\u2019t seem to improve it\u2019s visual quality (all these places look the same, quality wise, in passthrough). Its like a step below an 80\u2019s\/90\u2019s VHS camcorder.\r  \n\r\n\n# Sound\n\n\rBoth are good. The VIVE has a little interference background noise but it\u2019s not noticeable when in a game. This comparison comes down to, do you like something covering your ears or not. I prefer the VIVE version more, it offers a little more privacy and helps with immersion by blocking out outside noise. Earbuds are an option for the Quest but I\u2019m not a fan of having them in my ears for longer periods of time.\r  \n\r\n\n# Battery\n\n\rThe battery life of the quest is one of its biggest weakness. It drains fast and I usually get an hour or so out of it. This isn\u2019t a huge issue because I don\u2019t have time to play longer than an hour at most. But it is annoying when I forget to recharge it. The battery of the VIVE wireless is a power bank that straps to your waist. I had no issues with it and it held a charge for decent amount of time. Its quality is top -notch as it hasn\u2019t noticeably degraded over the years and it maintains a charge even when stored for a long period of time.\r  \n\r\n\n# Cost\n\n\rBoth are expensive. I paid $800 just for the Pro 2 headset alone. Add on the additional costs of the Valve controllers and base stations; and your looking at a small fortune just to play VR. In comparison, the Quest is a steal. But in fairness, there\u2019s about a two and a half year difference between the products, so the price should drop as the technology matures. The Quest 3 only seems expensive because the previous Quest 2 was so much cheaper. To give credit to Meta, it looks like they are selling the base 128GB model at cost, or more likely at a loss (so you are getting a lot of tech for the price of the 128GB model). But Meta really gouges you with their official aftermarket accessories. Their accessories are overly expensive, and all seem to be roughly double the price of the non-official variants (really taking a page out of Apple\u2019s book).\r  \n\r\n\n# Tracking\n\n\rI can\u2019t really complain or find many faults with either headsets. My VIVE setup tracks perfectly in any light condition and I never had a single issue. For the Quest 3, I haven't had tracking issues for 98% of the time. My only issues are it losing tracking in low light situations, and sometimes it\u2019s delayed\/slow when using Air Link for PCVR (not all times...only when Air Link is already running poorly), and once in a while it freak out when will set a controller down on my lap, essentially out of view of a cam\/sensor.\r  \n\r\n\n# Size and weight\n\n\rThe VIVE is a chunky boy compared to the Quest, and it\u2019s also almost twice as heavy. In real world use, I don\u2019t notice the differences as the VIVE is very well balanced. The Quest is obviously more front heavy. And while Meta noted the Quest 3 was thinner compared to the Quest 2, it doesn\u2019t really seem that much thinner, even compared to the VIVE (only comparing the front housing with facial interface). It seems Meta wasn\u2019t including the facial interface when making these claims. At the end of the day, the Quest is smaller &amp; thinner, but not as much as the marketing would make you think.\n\n# \rDesign &amp; Appearance of the Headsets\n\n\rTo be fair, I don\u2019t really care too much what a headset looks like. I don\u2019t display my headsets and I don\u2019t see it when using it...so who cares. But if I had to choose, I prefer the black and dimpled look of the VIVE. Credit to Meta, the white look of the Quest does standout as something different in the sea of dark colored VR headsets. The white looks clean and while I don\u2019t mind it on the plastic shell, I absolutely hate it on the fabric headband; it\u2019s too hard to keep clean.\r  \n\r  \nI also prefer the interface\/nose area design of the VIVE more. The VIVE has rubber flaps\/shades around the nose area that blocks outside light from getting into the headset from the gap between the headset and your nose; it works very well. The Quest lacks this feature and I find it odd that Meta didn\u2019t include them, or someway to block outside light. In reality, the Quest lets in a lot of light from this area, which can break the immersion you eventually learn to ignore it). I guess if I have to find a positive about it, then it would be that I can just look down through this gap to read text messages, orient myself to my room, or do other minor outside world activities without having to takeoff the headset.\r  \n\r\n\n# Final Conclusion: Am I happy and should you buy the Quest 3 if you have a VIVE Pro 2?\n\n\r  \nOverall, I am loving the Quest 3 and its gotten me really excited about VR\/AR again. It\u2019s not perfect but it is a great device. I was happy with my VIVE setup, but my life has changed and it had some shortfalls. My only regret is buying the 128GB version. I bought this version over the 512GB, as I only planned to stream PCVR games, so no since in paying $150 more for extra storage that I didn\u2019t plan to use. But after experiencing the convenience being able to instantly jump into a game, without having to get my PC running and connecting my headset; I\u2019ve come to realize that I am buying and playing more and more stand alone games.\r  \n\r  \nBut after all this, do I think the Quest 3 worth it over the VIVE Pro 2? If you don\u2019t have a VIVE Pro 2, then the answer is an easy yes, with a doubt (unless you have a hang up about the Facebook aspect). But if you already own a VIVE Pro 2, is it worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to the Quest 3? Well, that\u2019s a yes and no answer:\r  \n\r  \n**Yes**. If you have similar circumstances to me; you no longer have free time to tinker with the gear and setup, you just want an easy and seamless ability to play VR, and you can\u2019t play next to your PC. Additionally, it\u2019s worth getting the Quest if you want wireless PCVR with very few compromises or want to see the latest in consumer level AR. (Wireless play through Air Link and the pancake lens are reasons enough to buy a Quest 3).\r  \n\r  \n**No**. I\u2019m having a blast with the Quest 3, but in all honesty, if I still had the free time and still lived in a place where I had a dedicated playspace, then I don\u2019t think I would have bought the Quest 3. I don\u2019t think the jump is big enough to warrant getting rid of the still high end\/high resolution VIVE Pro 2, along with the base stations and knuckles. I would ride out this VR headset generation with the Pro 2 and wait to upgrade in the next gen.","author_fullname":"t2_6bb46e6l","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Review of my Quest 3 compared to my VIVE Pro 2 w\/ wireless - Should you \"upgrade?\"","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":null,"downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18q1r1m","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":"4f9d5e8a-6c37-11e9-b35f-122677b24742","is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":"new","author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703445343.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.Vive","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all, I wanted to provide a review and some insights into my Quest 3, and more specifically how it compares to my HTC VIVE Pro 2.

The interface doesn\u2019t seem bloated. Boundary setup was easy, and worked as intended. I really like when you break a boundary, the passthrough actives and you can see your actual room. My only annoyance is I can\u2019t permanently delete an app that I purchased\/downloaded to my library (I can only uninstall them). E.g. I downloaded the Beat Saber demo and later purchased the full game and for some reason, Meta wont let me permanently remove the demo from my library (the demo is always visible in my apps library, even though its uninstalled).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding SteamVR and the VIVE, I didn\u2019t have many issues, but there were more than a few times where I would have to reset my headset to be recognized, reload SteamVR, base stations not being recognized, and I would have to reestablish my playarea every couple days, etc. (small things that just added up). The playspace boundaries never worked quite right on my VIVE\/SteamVR; sometimes it would activate and sometimes it wouldn&amp;#39;t. At the end of the day, I always seemed to be tinkering with the setup before I was able to get into VR (I realize this is one\u2019s \u201clot in life\u201d when they are an earlier adapter of new tech, but just comparing that to where we are now with the ease of Quest 3). I also now have a family, so between them and my work, I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of time to game anymore. So when I do get a few minutes or hour to do so, the last thing I want to do is waste time trying to get it running. This is one of the best selling points for the Quest, it just works without any fuss.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Air Link &amp;amp; VIVE Wireless Adapter&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I originally bought the quest so I could play my PCVR library in a different room from my PC, and Air Link seemed like the answer. When Air Link works, its actually very impressive. It seems to have minimal compression and I hardly noticed any artifacts. But sometimes it will lag and the graphics look like shit, which causes me to change over to a standalone game. It\u2019s inconsistent (even when right next to my PC and router), so the issues may be due to interference from other devices\/busy times of the day.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Besides this, the biggest issue I have with Air Link is connecting it to SteamVR. Sometime I can connect the Quest 3 quickly and be in my SteamVR \u201chome\u201d in minutes, while other times I have to restart\/reconnect the Quest to my PC or restart Steam (sometimes multiple times). I just can\u2019t get the connection process to be consistent. *EDIT: Just saw the Valve released a Steam Link app for the Quest, I\u2019ll start testing that shortly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIVE wireless adapter is a mix bag. Unlike Air Link, I need to be near my PC for the VIVE wireless adapter to register. I never had issues with stuttering, lag, or the wireless adapter overheating. It worked exactly how HTC designed it to, although getting the HTC software to recognize it could be a chore. However, the biggest issue I had with it was the amount of compression; the graphics took too big of a hit for me. So I only used it for a short time before going back to wired. I was swapping between wired and wireless based on the game I was playing, but changing out the cords on the headset is a pain in the ass. At the end of the day, the VIVE Pro 2 visuals and resolution are meant for wired to get the most out of the headset graphically (it\u2019s really the reason why you would buy this headset in the first place). On any other prior VIVE headset, the wireless adapter would be acceptable and worth it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passthrough&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never used it on the VIVE (never had a reason to). The passthrough on the Quest is really cool and has so much potential, and it\u2019s good enough for doing basic everyday things without needing to remove the headset. It\u2019s one of the features that I was really intrigued and excited about, however, I feel that reviewers (especially VR YouTube reviewers that I follow), over-hyped and over sold it\u2019s capability. The passthrough is very grainy and has a lot of noise, and the warping near edges of items can be nauseating. I\u2019ve tried the Quest in different lighting, outside (careful to avoid direct sunlight on the inside lenses), in my kitchen, and living room and can\u2019t seem to improve it\u2019s visual quality (all these places look the same, quality wise, in passthrough). Its like a step below an 80\u2019s\/90\u2019s VHS camcorder.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sound&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are good. The VIVE has a little interference background noise but it\u2019s not noticeable when in a game. This comparison comes down to, do you like something covering your ears or not. I prefer the VIVE version more, it offers a little more privacy and helps with immersion by blocking out outside noise. Earbuds are an option for the Quest but I\u2019m not a fan of having them in my ears for longer periods of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Battery&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The battery life of the quest is one of its biggest weakness. It drains fast and I usually get an hour or so out of it. This isn\u2019t a huge issue because I don\u2019t have time to play longer than an hour at most. But it is annoying when I forget to recharge it. The battery of the VIVE wireless is a power bank that straps to your waist. I had no issues with it and it held a charge for decent amount of time. Its quality is top -notch as it hasn\u2019t noticeably degraded over the years and it maintains a charge even when stored for a long period of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Cost&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Both are expensive. I paid $800 just for the Pro 2 headset alone. Add on the additional costs of the Valve controllers and base stations; and your looking at a small fortune just to play VR. In comparison, the Quest is a steal. But in fairness, there\u2019s about a two and a half year difference between the products, so the price should drop as the technology matures. The Quest 3 only seems expensive because the previous Quest 2 was so much cheaper. To give credit to Meta, it looks like they are selling the base 128GB model at cost, or more likely at a loss (so you are getting a lot of tech for the price of the 128GB model). But Meta really gouges you with their official aftermarket accessories. Their accessories are overly expensive, and all seem to be roughly double the price of the non-official variants (really taking a page out of Apple\u2019s book).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tracking&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can\u2019t really complain or find many faults with either headsets. My VIVE setup tracks perfectly in any light condition and I never had a single issue. For the Quest 3, I haven&amp;#39;t had tracking issues for 98% of the time. My only issues are it losing tracking in low light situations, and sometimes it\u2019s delayed\/slow when using Air Link for PCVR (not all times...only when Air Link is already running poorly), and once in a while it freak out when will set a controller down on my lap, essentially out of view of a cam\/sensor.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Size and weight&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VIVE is a chunky boy compared to the Quest, and it\u2019s also almost twice as heavy. In real world use, I don\u2019t notice the differences as the VIVE is very well balanced. The Quest is obviously more front heavy. And while Meta noted the Quest 3 was thinner compared to the Quest 2, it doesn\u2019t really seem that much thinner, even compared to the VIVE (only comparing the front housing with facial interface). It seems Meta wasn\u2019t including the facial interface when making these claims. At the end of the day, the Quest is smaller &amp;amp; thinner, but not as much as the marketing would make you think.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Design &amp;amp; Appearance of the Headsets&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I don\u2019t really care too much what a headset looks like. I don\u2019t display my headsets and I don\u2019t see it when using it...so who cares. But if I had to choose, I prefer the black and dimpled look of the VIVE. Credit to Meta, the white look of the Quest does standout as something different in the sea of dark colored VR headsets. The white looks clean and while I don\u2019t mind it on the plastic shell, I absolutely hate it on the fabric headband; it\u2019s too hard to keep clean.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also prefer the interface\/nose area design of the VIVE more. The VIVE has rubber flaps\/shades around the nose area that blocks outside light from getting into the headset from the gap between the headset and your nose; it works very well. The Quest lacks this feature and I find it odd that Meta didn\u2019t include them, or someway to block outside light. In reality, the Quest lets in a lot of light from this area, which can break the immersion you eventually learn to ignore it). I guess if I have to find a positive about it, then it would be that I can just look down through this gap to read text messages, orient myself to my room, or do other minor outside world activities without having to takeoff the headset.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Conclusion: Am I happy and should you buy the Quest 3 if you have a VIVE Pro 2?&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am loving the Quest 3 and its gotten me really excited about VR\/AR again. It\u2019s not perfect but it is a great device. I was happy with my VIVE setup, but my life has changed and it had some shortfalls. My only regret is buying the 128GB version. I bought this version over the 512GB, as I only planned to stream PCVR games, so no since in paying $150 more for extra storage that I didn\u2019t plan to use. But after experiencing the convenience being able to instantly jump into a game, without having to get my PC running and connecting my headset; I\u2019ve come to realize that I am buying and playing more and more stand alone games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after all this, do I think the Quest 3 worth it over the VIVE Pro 2? If you don\u2019t have a VIVE Pro 2, then the answer is an easy yes, with a doubt (unless you have a hang up about the Facebook aspect). But if you already own a VIVE Pro 2, is it worth \u201cupgrading\u201d to the Quest 3? Well, that\u2019s a yes and no answer:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes&lt;\/strong&gt;. If you have similar circumstances to me; you no longer have free time to tinker with the gear and setup, you just want an easy and seamless ability to play VR, and you can\u2019t play next to your PC. Additionally, it\u2019s worth getting the Quest if you want wireless PCVR with very few compromises or want to see the latest in consumer level AR. (Wireless play through Air Link and the pancake lens are reasons enough to buy a Quest 3).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No&lt;\/strong&gt;. I\u2019m having a blast with the Quest 3, but in all honesty, if I still had the free time and still lived in a place where I had a dedicated playspace, then I don\u2019t think I would have bought the Quest 3. I don\u2019t think the jump is big enough to warrant getting rid of the still high end\/high resolution VIVE Pro 2, along with the base stations and knuckles. I would ride out this VR headset generation with the Pro 2 and wait to upgrade in the next gen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_378go","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","id":"18q1r1m","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"mtr5223","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/18q1r1m\/review_of_my_quest_3_compared_to_my_vive_pro_2_w\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/18q1r1m\/review_of_my_quest_3_compared_to_my_vive_pro_2_w\/","subreddit_subscribers":175586,"created_utc":1703445343.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Vive","selftext":"Please help, HTC support won't.

Not sure if it matters, but fpsvr also shows that i have an extremely high reprojection rate, sitting anywhere from 48%-99%.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m frustrated that the product I spent nearly 2000 cd isn&amp;#39;t working and i&amp;#39;m about ready to return it and go for one of the standalone vr headsets.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry for how this post is structured, I&amp;#39;ll try to be more specific if someone asks a specific question.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5ca4b972-9808-11e5-a43c-0e3cca2f2cc3","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_378go","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","id":"18e0j9y","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"alno1935","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/18e0j9y\/vive_pro_2_blurry_and_limited_fps_on_certain_games\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/18e0j9y\/vive_pro_2_blurry_and_limited_fps_on_certain_games\/","subreddit_subscribers":175621,"created_utc":1702080304.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Vive","selftext":"It\u2019s an original Indo-French series with six episodes revolving around themes of human connections, virtual worlds, metaverse identities and secret corporations.

context obviously is needed. I had been given a Vive Cosmos awhile ago and the Cable to the headset died after about 3 months which granted it was in bad shape. i bought a new one which after awhile started to get an oil like substance appearing on the outside.. not sure what it was just that after it showed up Vive console kept giving me the same error, 006. so i contacted Vive support and then they suggested buying another cable......  \n\n\nhonestly I think they are purposely building these to break cause I took extremely good care of this second cable I made sure it never got knots or twists and still some how it breaks, I never used it for more that like 3 hours maybe (honestly probably less) per session in VR, but its starting to get to me that they are just money hungry grubs..... I don't know what to think and I can't go order an index cause they don't ship to Australia. It feels like this is going to be a constant struggle and I'm not for it, another issue is I make most of my money off of some stuff I do in VR and now that whole side of things is gone.","author_fullname":"t2_jvyc3cyb","gilded":0,"title":"Honestly getting sick of this bullshit...","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"ex viabutton cCKpMw","thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"VR Experiences","score":1,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.Vive","allow_live_comments":false,"suggested_sort":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":true,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"ee8b1e72-69a9-11e5-bb28-0e53d95baa8f","can_gild":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"removed_by":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_378go","link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","id":"12x0qqo","is_robot_indexable":true,"author":"MaterialUnique6060","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/12x0qqo\/honestly_getting_sick_of_this_bullshit\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/12x0qqo\/honestly_getting_sick_of_this_bullshit\/","subreddit_subscribers":176933,"created_utc":1682305343,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false,"retrieved_utc":1682305355,"updated_utc":1682305356,"utc_datetime_str":"2023-04-24 03:02:23"},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"Vive","selftext":"a bit of context, I have a Quest 2, Vive trackers 3.0 and Base Stations 2.0.

But at the same time I feel like better choices are around the corner\n* PSVR2 has an incredible OLED screen but only works with the PS5 (for now at least)\n* Oculus Quest 2 runs at a nice 120hz refresh rate but is very heavy even after I've moded mine to fit my head far better.\n* Oculus Quest Pro has a better display and probably fits better on my head, but it's not a huge improvement\n* I am not exactly on the edge of my seat for Apples VR offering, it won't run with any existing VR apps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, since I'm not at a point where I want to buy a tethered headset like the Valve Index, I'll be sticking with this for now with the caveat that I will be immediately tinkering with any proposed solutions to make the headset more comfortable to wear for my head shape. Aside from that and the software experience it is still a very good headset, just with major flaws. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have some very important feedback for the Vive team that I hope gets to them, most of these can actually be fixed through software and I think this product is worth improving in this generation, it certainly gives me plenty of excitement already to see the next one the Vive team makes. \n\n**1 - Connected to the 2.4ghz band of my network**\n\nI had to straight out disable my 2.5ghz band to force the headset to 5ghz for streaming, didn't get any warnings when I started streaming and streaming was completely unusable until I figured it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2 - The face gasket is uncomfortable for intense VR sessions**\n\nI tried to play beatsaber with the headset on, in order to keep it tight enough to hop around in game I had to over-tighten it and it made a bright red imprint in the middle of my forehead. I assume my head is a little big, and there is potential for a replacement gasket paired with a battery pack that has something that uses your forehead for stability, like the quest pro, which would be great for home even if it's too bulky to travel with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's also just uncomfortable in general, I've tried many different positions and tightness's, making sure I take a break between attempts to ensure my face isn't just still sore from the last attempt, and even though the headset is light, without a top head strap it is extremely difficult to get the headset to rest comfortably on my head without digging into my face. I'm hopeful that future replacement gaskets help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3 - I miss my Quest 2's 120hz overclock option**\n\nThe 90hz is mostly fine, but is a little painful to stream beatsaber with. I'd love the option to allow the streamed game to run at a higher refresh rate than the headset as well to reduce input lag.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4 - I cannot read my phone notifications using passthrough**\n\nI heard multiple reviewers say they didn't have to take off the headset to interact with phone notifications, this was such a common thread that it feels like it was a talking point from HTC, but in the real world your lighting will make the camera over-expose and any displays will be unreadable unless in perfect lighting due to blooming around white text on black backgrounds.\n\nIf you're coming from the Quest 2 passthrough, it is color video that's higher resolution, but since there's effectively no depth to the video feed it's far less usable to navigate the real world without taking off the headset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5 - Boundaries get aggressively smoothed when placing them**\n\nI'd prefer to be able to place a few pins down that don't get smoothed, the current approach is far less customizable than the quest 2's boundary system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6 - Hand tracking is still rough**\n\nI think facebook did a bit of a better job with it, but they haven't perfected it either. And I'm guessing some of the lighting of my room doesn't help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**7 - The android Vive Manager app is incredibly broken**\n\nOnce you tap into the store it locks you into \"Business Apps\" and will not let you leave that screen. Tapping the back button doesn't work, and force quitting the app and restarting it doesn't escape the screen. I also can't get my phone display in VR, even after giving the app the proper permissions the headset tells me I don't have them, and I can't get into the settings of the app to try to check in there.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177019,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Feedback from my first day with the Vive XR Elite","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.73,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/127lb1j\/feedback_from_my_first_day_with_the_vive_xr_elite\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"JackieTreehornz","author_created_utc":1420546868,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_kjloo","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1680126358,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1680127040.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"1261qio","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_1261qio","no_follow":false,"num_comments":6,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/1261qio\/how_to_view_360_video_in_the_vive_xr_elite\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1680989307,"score":8,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"So I've had this thing for two days now, coming from an Oculus Quest 2, and am still on the fence about keeping it, primarily for the reasons many others have mentioned:\n\n* Complete lack of standalone apps\/utility.\n* Image sharpness - there is a very small sweet spot in the center of my FOV where text is sharp, for example.\n* The fan noise is kinda annoying.\n\nIf I keep it, it will probably be to use it primarily for travel.

I'll be going through everything I've taken note of so far.\n\nFirst of all, the biggest problem with the headset right now is that the hardware was released before the software was finished. What I mean is, the OS has an early Beta\/Late Alpha feel to it. Hand tracking inputs aren't tuned very well at all, despite being accurate. Pinching is way too overly-sensitive, resulting in unintended inputs, and those inputs aren't handled by the UI very well either (setting up a boundary with your hand is nearly impossible). In addition, they didn't wait until a stable software library was ready before throwing it into people's hands. On top of that, many apps you actually can download aren't even configured to work with the controllers, some of those being first party Vive Studio apps. This makes HTC look very unprofessional, and the result is it being next to useless as a standalone until the expected apps are available and existing ones fixed. These aspects will probably solve themselves within the next 6 months or so, but the damage of weak first impressions has already been done. I'm confident that they can fix this as there's some impressive stuff that is there (the way it distorts your passthrough image to correct the relative position of your virtual hand\/controller despite only having one camera, for example), they just need time.\n\nNext, I want to talk about the PCVR experience. Since there's not really any standalone support right now, this is where any current user will spend most of their time. I'll start by saying that the SteamVR integration for stand-alone headsets is second to none. Rather than have a clunky multi-step system, it's so simple that your PCVR games show up in the local library itself without needing to toggle settings or navigate menus. It's a one-time set up and you're good to go. It even supports hand tracking as a PCVR input, something the Quest lineup doesn't allow. Now as far as the actual experience, here's where they made some really big oversights. The streaming quality is excellent, equal to the quest 2 or even better (I unfortunately gave my Quest 2 to a family member, so I can only compare from memory), but the default settings make it appear terrible. The thing that makes this really bad is that actually knowing that settings to configure this exist aren't clearly delivered to the user. They exist only within the Vive Streaming Hub settings itself, and don't appear in the Headset's UI at all. Simply adding quality settings under the PC connection tab in the headset would solve this misconception. This could also be helped by making the default quality settings context and environment dependent (default to max settings on USB or Wifi6\/6e, or lower if PC has low VRAM). I started off being really disappointed with the default compressed quality, but when I found those settings and bumped them up, I was greeted with a beautiful native looking picture. In addition, there's another setting in the Streaming Hub that's enabled by default called compatibility mode. This causes Steam VR to see your controller as Cosmos controllers, which is a horrible idea because only a tiny fraction of games even support that controller to begin with. I've found that letting SteamVR see the XR controllers for what they really are works in games almost 100% of the time. This should absolutely be off by default and accessible in the Headset's connections tab UI too. There's also another oversight in the Vive Streaming Hub, it has an always on Foveated rendering, probably because the Focus 3 was what the app was built for. If this can be disabled, I haven't figured it out.\n\nSo in fewer words, the PCVR experience can be and is decent if not great, but the defaults provide a subpar experience and it's not intuitive or obvious how to make it better.\n\nNow for comfort and hardware. This headset was marketed as extremely comfortable, and in certain conditions it is, but for most, it's the most uncomfortable headset I've ever worn. Nearly all of the problems seem to stem from the pancake lens implementation. The lenses are very small, circular, and the diopters prevent it from being bigger or shapier. In a standard headset you typically want to tighten down to get a good FOV. In the XR Elite, this doesn't work. The top of the facial interface has a hard plastic forehead rest that absolutely kill any comfort you may have had. I think this part could easily be solved by making it hard rubber instead, or something similar, which can easily be done in a hardware revision like the Quest 2 did with it's facial interface. Though, the probable reason why it's like that is because you can't actually go closer than it wants you to. Unlike most Fresnel lensed headsets, or even the Quest Pro, there's no angled cutout on the lens to factor your nose, so pushing your face closer will actually force the lenses apart. It's just literally incapable of being closer to your face, so if your head shape is more curved than flat, coupled with the reduced lens size created by having diopters, you're going to have a very small FOV. Using these in glasses mode with the top strap used as a back strap is probably the most comfortable (and surprisingly stable) way to use this headset, it's genuinely impressive, but you lose an extra 5 to 10 degrees of FOV or so on an already small FOV. So how can this be fixed? Without significant hardware changes, this is probably impossible, but if it were to be redesigned I would absolutely cant the lenses at an angle or drop the diopter and in favor of a lens shape that factors the nose placement. The pancake lenses themselves don't seem to offer any substantial benefit, as the god-rays are replaced by general glare instead and the larger edge-to-edge clarity is offset by the overall loss of FOV. (edit: to be specific about the current FOV size, I would say the closest headset I've worn to it is the HP Reverb G2 V1)\n\nNow for the price to value aspect. HTC really wants to sell this as a consumer product going against the Pico 4 and Quest 2, but the reality is that the price determines what people compare it to, not the labels. A consumer willing to pay $1100 for a headset is probably also considering a Quest Pro, a Vive Focus 3, a Vive Pro 2, a Pimax 8KX or Crystal. Even staying within the Vive ecosystem, while I don't own a Focus 3, I do own a Pro 2 (which shares a lot with the Focus 3), and the Vive Pro 2 is hands down a far superior VR experience in every category (it's even far more comfortable), for about the same price. The quality difference between Focus 3 and XR Elite feels like a Quest 2 to Quest Pro gap, not the small marginal gap the XR Elite\/Focus 3 prices would have you assume. Since the stand alone library doesn't really exist yet, it can only be measured as a PCVR headset, and as one, it falls very short. If I were Vive, I would really double down on making the stand alone library as healthy as possible. Do whatever you need to do, pay developers to port, just get it there. Use that library to strengthen the value of Viveport to gain more subscriptions. Good, now you have the revenue stream that makes it possible to lower the price of the XR Elite. Drop it to at least $800 as soon as possible and aim for $600 or so as a long-term goal. If the product has a reason to be used and the cost is right, people will use it. Content attracts users, users attract developers, and developers create content. Fail to realize this early on, and you become a Sega Saturn\/PS Vita\/Philips CD-I. HTC needs to realize that they're in the console market now, not simply the hardware market. Different rules apply for success. Also, HTC, stop trying to bank on attracting the Crypto crowd. They aren't a goldmine more profitable than the users you already have. They aren't paying customers, they're customers expecting to be paid.\n\nI've seen quality control issues floating around, seemingly on par with Pico 4 issues. I'm among those effected, as I have a dead pixel on my headset. I've never had issues with Vive headsets before, so I think this is probably a result of them trying to push out too many headsets too fast. This is very bad on their part, and it seems they've greatly underestimated the importance of a good initial launch. Early reviews are one of the deciding factors on whether hardware sinks or swims, and because of the rush, nearly everyone that has one is disappointed, and their reviews are what future customers base their decisions on. It didn't need to be that way. Had the higherups simply had the foresight to allow the XR Elite to be completed before launch and making sure each headset shipped wasn't defective, the odds of it succeeding would have been astronomically higher. Since they didn't, most people are returning their headsets and potential buyers are rightfully steering clear due to the bad launch press. Just look at the Steam Deck, people had to wait a long time to get theirs, it made them restless and angry, but at the end of the day the product they got was exactly as promised 99.9% of the time, and as a result it's praised as a great success despite taking a long time to get in people's hands. Most of us would have preferred to wait for a good product than get an undercooked one now (whether we consciously realize that or not).\n\nDespite the current state, I'm not returning mine. It does what I need it to do as a developer, I have other headsets to do what it can't, and I'm willing to wait for the software side to get better with time. Since Pico might never come to the USA, this is pretty much the only semi-competent Meta alternative in the states until Deckard shows up in a decade or two. Hope this was useful to someone.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177019,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My comprehensive Vive XR Elite thoughts, experiences, and ideas for how HTC can fix its flaws.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/125vuwg\/my_comprehensive_vive_xr_elite_thoughts\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"cwhenry","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"new","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"4f9d5e8a-6c37-11e9-b35f-122677b24742","author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_g43r1cuj","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1679867032,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1680104998.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"1230s2e","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_1230s2e","no_follow":false,"num_comments":16,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/1230s2e\/xr_elite_finally_in_handnot_perfect_but_thrilled\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1680993393,"score":50,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Spoiler, there is much to refine but I am pleased with the XR Elite and encouraged that many issues I have read from others have been sorted as I had absolutely no issues with streaming PCVR wired, mirroring phone(Samsung S22+), Immersed worked flawlessly, store is adding titles\n\nSo it is always important to preface what I was looking for here in a VR headset.  I am not telling you the headset is better than any other, that is always going to vote down to your desired usage.\n\nFor me, I already have an Index and Reverb G2 and firmly entrenched in PCVR.  No interest in console and after those headsets couldn't downgrade visual and sound quality to consider Q2.  QP was too uncomfortable and awkward for me, better visuals than Q2 but l wasn't impressed for the money, \n\nI was looking for a headset that could fit the following:\n\n* PCVR wired\n* PCVR wireless\n* Mobile Mirroring VR\n* Standalone VR\n* Compact for Travel\/Flight Movie Watching\n* VR workspace in a pinch that was Viable\n* Viable Passthrough\n\nThat said the XR Elite was the closest from my estimation that fit the bill for me.  Since I was entrenched in PCVR the Facebook Meta library is a non factor for me and I have no doubt the library will fill for HTC.\n\nFor some critical categories for me:\n\nComfort: \n\nIt is light and once dialed in more comfortable than either of my other headsets but it took some effort to dial it in.  While not horrible for me, expect third party face gaskets will improve this.  I do find the full headset with pack much more comfortable.  The glasses arms are not long enough for me and, while tolerable, is not comfortable.  Also, the arms should rotate a bit to allow you to adjust the fit to your face better, especially in glasses mode.\n\nVisual Clarity:\n\nAs expected it is not as good as the Reverb G2 though not far off, but much better than index. For my eyes, noticeably better than the Q2, and on par with QP though to my eyes XR is touch more clear.  The one thing I did notice is light bleed of white text on dark backgrounds, this has been mentioned by others and can be bad in some cases.\n\nFOV:\n\nSeems roughly the same as QP, better than Q2, and definitely less than the G2 and Index, but honestly given the ease of use, lightness, and connection and overall performance with comparable (G2) or better visuals (Index) I feel for casual\/social gaming use it will likely be my daily driver despite less FOV.  To get more clarity\/resolution with large FOV it will require ridiculous hardware (like a $1.5-2k 4090) to run it so don't expect affordable rigs anytime soon. No scuba mask effect for me that others have suggested.\n\nSound:\n\nIt is better than I expected here.  Coming from Index and G2 it is no where near that but definitely better to my ears than Q2 and QP.  I did notice that at lower to mid volumes it sounds pretty decent but at higher volumes you start to notice an imbalance with bass lacking.  I was able to use BT headphones (Nuratrue Pros) to watch movies with no sync issues, worked beautifully.  I have not tried it with games yet though.  If there were sync issues, I wonder if BT 5.3 would help, don't know enough here to speak to this...maybe someone out there has more insight.\n\nPassthrough:\n\nThis was a bit more disappointing, clearer than any other but still not workable.  If you look at a screen with text that has white background from a distance looks just white until you move it very close to the headset.  Additionally everything looks oddly flat...depth sensor is still not enabled so we will see how it is in future.  Resolution is still not great but passthrough is better than any I have tried to date.\n\nHand Tracking:\n\nWork in progress.  It is workable with some gnashing of teeth along the way.  Also mostly available for menus and mirroring, not for many games at moment.  The menu gesture worked great for me, the pinching to click\/select often selected when I didn't pinch. Likely due to angle of camera to my hand so may take some learning on my part.\n\nSo how did XR Elite fare in each of my uses above?\n\nPCVR Wired:\n\nDownloaded the vive streaming app to PC, plugged in and up came my steam home and away I went into my library.  Demeo, Walkabout Minigolf, Alex and others all worked without issue or hitch.\n\nPCVR Wireless:  \n\nI did not get to try this properly, leaving for a trip, but was able to actually connect and start to play Walkabout with my PC wireless and the headset wireless on heavily shared wifi 5 but did get choppy quickly.  If I wired the PC to router expect this would have resolved this so very promising, sorry can't offer more here.\n\nMobile Mirroring:\n\nFor me this was easy to set up, download the manager, connected to same wifi, selected mirroring and it paired and just worked with my Samsung S22+. It was clear and responsive with no issues.  In landscape it really crunches your view and portrait seems unusually tall and thin but overall workable and watching movies was great in a non-noisy environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStandalone VR:\n\nWorked great, visuals were better than I expected, but did not do much more that immersed, Cosmic Flow, and some other free options as leaving for a trip so didn't have much time. Others will undoubtedly be able to provide further insight here.  PCVR is my main use so not as vital for me.\n\nTravel\/ Flight Movies:\n\nUsed a MS Surface with streaming cable and worked just spectacularly.  Can't tell you how good this experience was especially with BT...don't bother with just headset speakers on a plane or other noisy environment as even at full volume you could barely hear the movie.  Also, movies via phone mirroring was not smooth, to stuttery\/lurchy, though sound with BT was good too.\n\nVirtual Workspaces:\n\nUsed Immerse for this and it is workable for sure.  Will not be as efficient as working with multiple screens in IRL yet to me but still investigating. Need to figure out if can do virtual screens in passthrough to use actual keyboard and mouse and simply have screens fixed in your space.  The resolution is not quite as sharp as I would like but working on the road it is definitely a viable option and could work for hours if I can sort out using actual mouse and keyboard.   \n\nPassthrough:\n\nDiscussed above, helpful but hope it improves with enabling of the depth sensor.  Resolution while better than any I have tried to date is still not great.  If AR is your thing there are better options.\n\nThere it is, hope it is helpful to some out there considering this headset.  For me this is the only one that ticked all the boxes for me to play my PCVR library but also be useful for Travel and have standalone with phone mirroring (compatible phones only).  HTC achieved a good balance with this headset and for someone new to VR who travels for work will be the best option out there in my opinion.  Hopefully they can improve on the glasses mode with longer arms and for future adjustable arms at the headset connection to allow for a better fit, but I am thrilled to see how the software improves seeing they are actively addressing many of issues people who had it early have reported.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177019,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"XR

my wife i just got our vive xr elite headsets in the mail. Very early initial impressions, i'll probably edit this with new info as i go.\n\n**Updates:**\n* 1\/03\/2023 - the free bundled apps are now appearing in the store, this includes ENGAGE, Unplugged air guitar and vive port video. Glimpse and Green Hell VR are still marked as Coming soon.\n* The new vive video app is really cool, its a video wall of curated content, such as asmr nature videos (low quality not 4k). There's also other video content that is locked behind a release wall so i can't try those out, but there's a yoga beach app that looks like it would be really neat, vr horror experience (IT chapter 2) again the video quality is pretty poor. There's gopro recorded footage, same thing videos aren't encoded high enough to really demonstrate the capabilities of the headset. Hopefully they recode things to much higher resolution.\n* ENGAGE is htc's metaverse from what i can tell. Not bad. I learned that i suck just as much dressing myself in avatar form as i do in IRL.\n\n* I've just figured out how to sideload android APK files using android platform tools. Here's what happens. If you load regular android apps in, eg Telegram etc they appear in a '2D content' filter in the apps area, opening these apps opens them on a flat surface for you to interact with. Not perfect but it seems to sort of work ok...\n\n---\n\n\n* This thing is SMALL. Compared to our OG vive or the hp reverb g2 it's half the size and weighs almost nothing.\n* The FOV seems less than my hp reverb with the mods, the facial insert is the issue here as bringing the eyes closer to the lenses improves things drastically.\n* The facial insert is... not great. the magnets aren't strong enough, the top is a hard plastic with not nearly enough foam padding so after taking it off your face, you still feel where it was pressing against your forehead. It does block out 95% of light (tiny bit of light leakage but it's fine). I'm really REALLY hoping there's an aftermarket facial insert because i've been very spoilt with the amazing products the customs community put together for the OG vive and my hp reverb, but i guess they necessitated a super comfy FI to offset the hefty weight on the head - which this doesn't have.\n   * Update! The top strap included in the box helps quite a bit, as it ensures the headset sits comfortably just sort of above the eyes where the sweet spot is for the lenses. It sits higher than older headsets, so this is something to get used to. The facial insert still isn't optimal, and sitting higher with the headstrap still can cause alot of light bleed around the edges. I'm sure this will get better going forward with more options.\n* The back battery comes off. I'm hoping there's a way to do steam vr passthrough or something to this via usb c... will investigate later.\n* Clarity is amazing though. The lenses are like nothing i've experienced before and i've been VRing since the DK1.\n* The phone setup app was simple and intuitive, ran me through wifi setup, account (you need a vive account for set up).\n* The controller pairing via bluetooth didn't work (my phone is a pixel 5), so i needed to connect them with the supplied usb type C cable to get them to connect. After that absolutely no problem.\n* Phone mirroring, requires miracast support on the phone to work, asked to enable some accessibility permissions and modify a system setting to enable vive manager to \"Allow modifying system settings\". After that it performed a quick check to ensure the phone was miracast compatible \"Your phone supports both miracast and HDCP 2.x\".\n* Then it displays some health and safety info and off you go!.\n* A system update via the phone was the first thing that happened next.\n* OK system update done, now it wants to adjust the diopters to make the image clearer... cool\n* OK the diopter setting is my first WOW moment: it enables passthrough camera at this stage and you can see your surroundings. It asks you to take off the facial insert and adjust one eye at a time. I'm wearing contact lenses and apparently my prescription isn't perfect as i need to set it to 1 for true clarity!\n* Diopter adjustment works by displaying a green cross in either eye (after blanking out the video from one eye), then you adjust the diopter until its clear\n* Next it made me reconnect the controllers... one controller again decided to not pair so i had to open the phone app and repair it manually. Annoying\n* Next is setting up the play space. This was amazing. I was first asked to 'push' the floor down to where my real floor is.\n* Then i was asked to trace my play space. I did this differently to my tethered experiences in the past given there's NO CABLES. So i traced from my study, out into the living room, a much larger play space than i'm used to. At this point passthrough was active, so i just walked back into my study with the headset still on to continue typing this post... with the headset still on... The VR boundaries glowing magically surrounding my real environment. Another wow moment.\n* OK So the passthrough, it's a bit weird. It's in colour but without depth, so there's some strange warping that goes on, like the image is being reconstructed and enhanced by an AI model rather than being a feed from the RGB camera, i believe this is how text clarity is being delivered, eg so you can read your phone. In fact i'm convinced this is what's happening, as the stability of the image can sometimes float around, some sort of ML model. Anyhow it's cool! And very useful.\n* OK Now I just set up a room that matches my physical room by placing objects in VR that match the dimensions of the real world, including tracing my desk, windows etc. Another wow moment.\n* PC desktop VR: OK so i have to install something on my PC for this to work.. getting there...\n* Disconnecting the battery pack at the back, you can plug in a usb cable to power it, or it has a tiny amount of juice to wear and operate for a short time. It's far from comfortable though, it really does require the back head strap with the battery to counter-weight and to keep in the right position. I guess you could use it in this mode if laying on a couch connected with a macbook cable or something and watch a movie laying down. The annoying thing here is that the ergonomics aren't designed for this mode clearly, the 'arms' grip your head a bit further up than what is ideal, so they don't really sit on your ears like a pair of glasses. I'd call this mode a gimmick rather than something i'll likely use often.\n* Internal fan went a bit crazy at one point, now the battery is drained so charging up.\n* Managed to connect the headset without the battery cradle to a macbook charger via usb C so i can use it while the battery is charging. Has to be via the usb C cable, won't work via a usb 2 cable. Needs 30w to run this way.\n* Finger tracking is really good. The gestures feel natural and accurate. Pinch to select stuff, or to scroll lists.\n* Phone mirroring isn't working for me yet, the manual connection instructions say the vive xr elite will be identified as \"ViveFocus3\\_\\[my device id\\]\"... that's clearly not right.\n* Was able to cast the VR view onto my phone, guessing you could use that to cast your VR view to a TV so others can see what you're doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SteamVR \/ Desktop Streaming:**\n\nWired: This works VERY well. I'm highly impressed, this is probably how i'll do all my desktop VR gaming, keeping the wireless for when it's really needed.\n\nWireless:\n\n* You'll need wifi 5 or 6 for this to work apparently. And apparently our network supports that. Yay.\n* I initially had sketchy reception streaming from a PC far away from me. My fix that might help others: If you have a wifi network that has satellite base stations for increasing range, put one ON your PC and connect it via ethernet so that your PC is connected directly to your router via the dedicated backbone which tends to be a higher bitrate and prioritised packet delivery. This has made streaming performance acceptable for me.\n* In the Vive Streaming Hub i turned the bitrate up to 200Mbps to improve the visuals and turned the quality settings up to Ultra. Without doing that it was mediocre quality.\n* Tried using hand tracking in steamVR but the hand models were not orientated properly and seemed to be off by about 45 degrees in the X axis.\n* Using controllers didn't have the model orientation issue. Perfect tracking.\n* The vive turned up as an audio device once the streaming hub was installed, setting my windows audio device output to the vive sent it streaming to my headset.\n* I'm not noticing any significant latency, but this will really depend on your network, your router's capabilities and having nothing else at all happening on your network. Once my wife and I start vrchatting at the same time im guessing the performance will tank somewhat as more packets get thrown around the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wierd Bugs\/Glitches:**\n\n* Hand tracking seems CPU intensive, will cause the fans to ramp up\n* If you move to another location, eg lay down on a couch or use headset in bed watching videos, you'll be presented with \"boundary tracking lost\", which then makes you REDO the entire boundary setup from scratch before you can use it. There is no way to cancel this, although you can go through the standing setup to get through it quicker... HOWEVER:\n* If you take the headset off, while in bed\/on a couch etc, then put it back on You'll immediately get the boundary lost message again and have to REDO the entire set up again.

I prioritise clarity, sweet spot, comfort, and OLED panels over FOV, resolution, and refresh rate. As long as it's a 90Hz OLED with around 100+ degrees of FOV, I'm happy.\n\nI have never tried a VP1, but I still own an OG Vive. I cannot stand the Vive because the resolution and lenses are both absolutely horrendous, even compared to the CV1. It's like looking at a 240p display through the base of a plastic cup.\n\nHowever, the VP1 with Gear VR lenses would provide a higher PPD than the CV1 (whereas Vive is actually significantly lower), and would be the clearest I've ever seen a VR display. I really do want a higher resolution, but there isn't a single headset that currently offers high res OLED, and it seems all the upcoming ones are going to be absurdly expensive.\n\nMy next best option would be to wait for the MeganeX, which is likely still 6+ months away from global release, and is going to cost over \u20ac1000 for just the headset. I can get a refurbished VP1 for \u20ac260 ish, so around \u20ac300 with lenses.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I've seen a few Vive Pro  (v1) headsets floating about the interwebs for 100-150$.\n\nI've  been wanting to buy one of these headsets, selling my original Vive HMD  in order to recoup most of that cost. If I play this right my upgrade  might only cost 50 USD.\n\nMy question is as follows:\n\n* Is  the Vive Pro compatible with OG Vive equipment (controllers and base  stations)?

If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.

I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.

It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177785,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/vc9x6s\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Okabe__Rintarou","author_created_utc":1539850755,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_2azppc0m","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1651783789,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"uj6xlb","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"hdw viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"5ca4b972-9808-11e5-a43c-0e3cca2f2cc3","link_flair_text":"Hardware","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_uj6xlb","no_follow":false,"num_comments":37,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/uj6xlb\/is_vive_2_pro_lens_quality_actually_bad\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1653964404,"retrieved_utc":1653964404,"score":14,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hello, I have a question. \n\nWell, I have switched from Oculus Rift S to HTC Vive 2 Pro.\n\nI'm wondering if the lens quality on the vive 2 is terrible or am I doing something wrong?\n\nI'm referring to the glowing\/blooming effect.

Although im pretty happy with it, it shows its age, especially in the department of resolution and SD.\n\n**Pro 2 review:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a few weeks ago i decided to upgrade to a Pro 2 wich turned out to not be an upgrade at all, at max a shift of compromises. So here a quick review of that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst there is the software (vive console). It refused to install properly on a PC with steam already installed (had to start steam manual during the right spot of the installation process or it would simply fail, annoying, but not a problem as soon as you figuere it out). Then, at least to me, it wasnt really clear which setting in which application did exactly what, with vive console and steam vr partially having the same settings. However, while beeing annoying, i could have lived with the software. \n\nNow to the actual HMD:\n\nResolution: Its really good. No SD at all and Texts are really easy to read. However its sadly not that big of a plus thanks to the sweetspot.\n\nRefresh rate: While its nice to have 120 Hz and some people will notice it, i didnt feel any benefit. Still nice to have.\n\nSweetspot: Probaply the biggest bummer of the Pro 2. Its tiny and by far the worst out of any Vr Headset i tried so far (OG Vive and Index). Not only that, but it gets even more blurry then my og vive once you leave the sweetspot. So its basically a rapid transition from \"pretty god damm sharp\" to \"is that a letter or a Dinosaur?\"\n\nFOV: The letterbox FOV people talk about is definetly noticable, but i didnt find it disruptive during normal play. While i didnt measure the FOV, it definetly seemed wider than that of my OG VIVE. However, it doesnt really matter anyways because the outer areas where so blurred, you could have easily replaced it with ambilight and saved the gpu power to render those areas.\n\nColors and Black level: Both pretty good for a LCD, better as the Index, worse as the VIVE.\n\nGod Rays: Not like actual rays like i would describe it on my vive, more like a cloud of white around bright elements. I found it more annoying than the rays, but that might be personal preference.\n\nAudio: Its pretty ok. Probaply enough for most people. If not you can take them off pretty easy and use your own headphones.\n\nHeadstrap and comfort: By far the best experience i had for now. The Headset feels very balanced, sits thight and its no problem to find the sweetspot (even the tiny one of the pro 2, just makes it more impressive :P) again after taking the HMD off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion the Pro 2 wasnt really a upgrade compared to my og vive. While the high resolution in the sweetspot was nice, i would consider the overall image quality as worse. Comfort however was definetly better.\n\nSo sadly i had to send it back, it just wasnt worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Now the actual question:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven after this dissapointing experience, my quest for a worthy update is still going on.\n\nWith my conclusion \"Image on pro 2 sucks, higher resolution nice, headstrap nice\" its only natural to take a look at the pro 1, which basically seem to have the best aspects of both worlds: Basically the same Lenses with a higher resolution OLED than my OG Vive and the basically same Headstrap as the Pro 2. \n\nAfter the pro 2 experience i also decided to try the gear vr lens mod on my og vive to test if it might make the pro 1 even more attractive, and oh boy, its amazing. Once positioned right i dont recoginze any barrel distortion at all, the sweetspot is huge and the god rays are gone. However the new clarity makes the low Resolution and the SD effect even more obvious.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what do you guys think. Is the VIVE Pro 1 with the gear VR lens mod a worthy upgrade?\n\nThe few through the lens comparisions between the og vive and pro 1 i found sometimes made it look like the pro 1 and the og vives display are pretty diffrent color wise. Can anyone who owned both headsets say a few words about the Color of the screens?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177793,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"OG Vive to Pro 1 (Gear VR) still a worthy upgrade?

The inspiration for this message came from an online news article by Attila Bertiz. The article [on the Keen Gamer website](https:\/\/www.keengamer.com\/articles\/news\/5-vr-games-considerate-of-people-with-disabilities\/), mentioned five VR games where developers designed measures to make them more accessible for respective players.\u00a0The five games discussed were Crystal Rift, The Persistence and Moss, Arca's Path, and finally Island 359.\n\nCrystal Rift assists visual impairments by making the font throughout menus and the game interactive. For example, it is possible to lean toward text. Moss assists hearing impairments in a class of its own, by using sign language. The Persistence also uses visual aids to replace certain sounds, like a skull showing where noise originates from.\n\nArca's Path has an innovative mobility aid for in game movement. It connects headset movements with a ball that can be controlled to move the player around. This reminds me of an aid in the HTC Pro Eye. Inside the headset there's an internal tracking camera. It can recognise facial expressions that can be tied to virtual movement\/functions. For example, using three quick eye blinks to teleport.\n\nThen Island 359 is more typical of current seated games. It changes physical differences such as height and provides reach assist for objects out of reach. Like Crystal Rift, it also has interactive menus\/font. Together these games represent individual measures that collectively will make a game more playable for seated players; but not so much individually, which continues now.\n\nIt has been my experience that all innovations are for able-bodied players. Most adjust height and\/or restrict field of view to 180-degrees.

The LED flickers between Green and White. And while this is happening the vibration motor kicks in constantly vibrating. This also happens when I use any touchpad controls.

Its still usable, if erratic, but its not ideal.\n\nIm not sure what could be wrong. I cant recall smashing it into a wall. I smashed my other controller which I had to replace with a new one.

Sell the Quest 2 for 250 euro and buy the HP Reverb G2 in February (\\~400 euro).\n2. Sell the Quest 2 for 250 euro and buy an used HTC vive with the DAS, and a Wireless adapter (250 euro), sell the Wireless thing (I don't have the CPU for it, and anyways, I use a pulley system) and probably the wands (I could use them for FBT), buy the Knuckles and do the lens mod.\n\n* The thing with the HP Reverb is that I don't really like the controllers and the tracking, also, I am going to play at a low res anyways, I don't really care that much about the resolution.\n* And the thing with the Vive, is that I want an oled display, I don't really care about the resolution, I would love to have the Knuckles, and with the time, I could upgrade to a Samsung Odyssey (200 euro) or a Vive pro (but that's a bit pricey), also, it works with Linux, and that's a BIG plus for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that worries me, is the SDE, 4 years ago I played Arizona sunshine in a vr \"arcade\" for 1 hour with my friend and my brother, and yes, the SDE was really a thing, but you in a few minutes forgot about it.\n\nBut now, having used headsets with very little to no SDE for 3 years, I don't really know if it's going to be a big issue, and also the low resolution, because with the Q2, it is just blurry, but the vive has a ton of aliasing.\n\nAnd this is why i'm asking you guys, anyone has upgraded to a newer HMD and can help me? It is going to be a big issue? or it is not as bad? And if anyone is wondering, yes, I'm in a budget of 450 euros, and I can't go crazy and buy the Reverb with base stations and the Knuckles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: I** ***really*** **hate Facebook, Quest 2 bad xD .

Got the unit in and quickly realized that a top of the line PC from 2015 just won't cut it. For context, my PC is running a Core i7-4790k on a Z97 motherboard with a GTX 1080 and 24GB of RAM. The Pro Eye tracking framework that runs in the background just decimates my 4790k when coupled with NeosVR and OVR Toolkit. When the face tracker arrived, I ran into even more snags with my PC, involving wild USB bandwidth issues. Since the tracker isn't exactly removable once you stick it to the HMD, I can't just pull it off and forget about it temporarily, so it stays connected. If I want to play in VRchat, then I'm fighting the HMD and my Vive Trackers for USB bandwidth. This isn't even mentioning a stupid issue I have with the microphone where if it's in the infamous \"helium mode\" everything is fine, but if it corrects itself, I lose a controller every single time. The controller stays connected to the HMD and SteamVR, but it doesn't track anything and I can't even press any buttons to do stuff in game, I have to power cycle the HMD from the linkbox and hope that any game or SteamVR doesn't panic over an HMD reset, Which only works half the time. Otherwise, I have to just restart the headset from SteamVR, which restarts everything. I have this weird controller disconnect issue occur every now and then with my Index as well and I'm not sure what's causing it. I've reinstalled SteamVR and the drivers in hopes of correcting it, but nothing has changed as far as I can tell. I'm using my 1.0 base stations in this room which I suppose could potentially be causing these controller dropouts from a glitch somehow, but I'd have to test that. I've tested another set of Index controllers and my Vive Wands and every pair of controllers do this same exact thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow getting to the Pro Eye itself. Overall, I like the headset. It's a pretty decent upgrade from the original Vive and it's definitely comparable to my Index. The eye tracking is outstanding and the face tracker is really cool as well.\n\nOne thing I was really looking forward to with the Pro is comfort. My biggest gripe with my Index is the comfort is lacking in comparison to my original Vive with the DAS and the Pro Eye fixes basically all of this.\n\nWhile the headset is nice, that doesn't mean it's perfect by any means. First up, the microphone problems. This is nothing new, the Vive Pro has some serious mic issues and despite existing since 2018, it has not been fixed, which is so frustrating. This isn't even Pro specific either, because my Cosmos Elite does the same exact thing, but that HMD doesn't glitch out literally every time I use it, unlike the Pro.\n\nNow I want to focus on the head strap for a minute. Overall it's a fine head strap, but it's got some very odd quirks that makes it inferior to the Vive DAS and the Index strap. Biggest thing I noticed immediately is that the Pro strap does not have the spring loaded tensioner built into it like the DAS and Index, that allows the strap to stay snug, but move if enough force is exerted on it, which I relied on all the time in the Vive and Index to adjust the position of the HMD on my face or just to move it to scratch my face. First time I tried to do that on the Pro, the tensioner started grinding gears and felt like it was gonna break. Very disappointing. My next issue with it is a little more minor, but I feel like it should be addressed. The back of the head strap is absurdly bulky for no reason. I lay back on my bed in my headsets all the time and the slim body of the DAS and Index makes this a very easy and comfy experience, where the Vive Pro and Cosmos makes your head lay in a awkward position and forces it to remain in uncomfortable positions, which just wreaks havoc on your neck after a few minutes. If this design choice was made to add weight to the back of the HMD, the engineers really should've just taken the DAS and integrated weights to the strap instead of making the strap so bulky, because this was not the correct solution for that issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeadphones. Hoo boy, these headphones are just... awful. There's no other way to put it, these headphones are absolutely terrible. I simply don't understand how HTC built very stout headphones for the DAS in both sound quality and construction and just completely dropped the ball on what's supposed to be their \"Pro\" headset. These headphones have no substance to them and the build quality of them is really poor in comparison to the DAS and Cosmos headphones. The only thing I like about them are the convenient volume and mic buttons. Aside from that, these are the worst headphones I've used on a headset to date. I imagine I'll be replacing this strap for a DAS in the not so distant future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo to summarize, the Vive Pro Eye is a fine headset especially if you're interested in full face tracking, but it has some pretty significant problems that make it a really hard sell at the price point HTC lists it at. You really need to make sure you have a PC that is capable of running this monstrous headset, because the added tracking accessories are very CPU heavy, not to mention soak up ludicrous amounts of USB bandwidth. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone is familiar with any of the issues I've mentioned in this post and you may have some solutions to them, please feel free to drop them in the comments, I'd really appreciate it!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177815,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro Eye VS Core i7-4790k.

I'd go over to the event\/party and set everything up, include a 4K TV on a big rolling stand so everyone could see what their friends are playing, have some good cable management, present quick safety instructions and recommendations, etc. Just give people a good time with friends and family and let them play for a few hours or a day while I go do other stuff and make money on the side. Eventually, I'd like to build a few more PCs and get more VR headsets and run a little rental business. I enjoy sharing my love of gaming with others and this is something I'm very confident doing. I live in a college town, so the market here is good if my rental prices are competitive enough for college students just looking to have a fun time with their buddies for the day.\n\n**Here's my issue:**\n\nI'd like to use Steam's VR Cafe program. It seems very simple to use and I don't have to call companies individually to get permission to use their games (except for beat saber probably... but that's another story).\n\nThe problem is that Steam's VR Arcade\/PC Cafe program seems to require that the PC being used for rental is being run at the same network as the server, or master account as they call it. Again, I plan on getting licenses for the games I plan on using, but with Steam's license program, it looks like I can't just rent out PCs and set them up at a different location than my master server. They state in an FAQ that my location needs to be on at all times and connected to the master server, and in the section about the VR Arcade Model, which I think is the same as the Cafe program, they mention \"VR station\" in the context of them being at one location as opposed to separate locations. I'm assuming that they expect most VR arcades to be in one place. Rightly so, but that's not what I need for what I'd like to do.\n\n**I think there may be a way around it, but this is where I may need clarification:**\n\nThey define \"PC Cafe\" on the agreement when I made the master server as \"any temporary or permanent physical place at which access to the Steam Client and\/or other Content and Services is made available to members of the public for free or for a fee. PC cafes in this sense may include, **without limitation**, cybercafes, retail installations, hospitals, libraries, pop-up displays, on-board-entertainment systems on trains or airplanes or locations offering VR experiences\" so I think for the most part I'm good with bringing my equipment over to someone's place and setting up there.\n\nBut the problem still lies with the possibility that I won't be able to do this due to eventually having more than one PC running at different locations. My potential fix with this would be having a VPN that would (as far as I understand VPNs) allow my PCs to be running on the same \"network,\" at least on the surface, and also setting the location of all of my PCs that would be \"rented out\" at my home location, being one location. Is this viable? Haha, and is it legal? I mean, there's nothing that states that I can't have them at different locations as long as they're on the same network, which they technically would be with a VPN. But I'm not quite sure. I'd like a third opinion before I go crazy with this.

I am set on getting index controllers. I can get a set of base stations and index controllers for $999AUD online. I can get a Vive pro 2 HMD for $1300AUD from a local store. I can get an index hmd for $1250AUD from eBay in the country. I can get a index full kit for about $2200ish AUD off eBay from the states. I can get a Pimax 5k super for about $1700 with index controllers plus base stations or an 8kx for about $2300 with the same kit.\n\nWhat makes me hesitant on the pro 2 is that from what I\u2019m reading, the audio on both the speakers and the microphone especially are fairly bad. And since I will mostly be playing VR with friends I would like a good mic. Also the headband design looks to not allow for use of a standard headphone or headset. As someone who has a small collection of hifi headphones I would like to use them if applicable(mainly for sit down applications for better audio). Also hearing issues regarding 3d stereo effect causing eye strain for this particular model.\n\nThe index seems a great all rounder as it comes with a great microphone and audio solution, while the headband also seems to allow for headphones. Sweet spot is larger according to some, and it has great fov out of the box. Also the super easy software integration is very nice. But the panels are 2 years old and apparently show their age. Also warranty might be a bit sketchy due to ordering off of eBay.\n\nThe pimax kits seem enticing as they use Amazon for shipping so warranty would be viable although I have heard mixed thoughts on this. Super wide fov would be nice but also seems to be a downside as it can produce distortions if not setup perfectly which may take some time. I have heard tracking is not that great and that not all games are supported properly. Also heard a lot of shoddy qc from them also. If they work perfectly though then they seem really good, especially the 8kx.

I actually have tried to get in contact with them beyond asking questions on kickstarter (where they've answered them) for some dev stuff and have not been able to. They have not hired their community team yet.*\n\nA lot of people for the last two years have said that when a competitor to the Quest emerges, they would jump ship, or that they\u2019re looking for a non facebook standalone. Well, it\u2019s here. Meet the Lynx. It\u2019s a $499 mixed reality headset. The main interaction scheme is Leap Motion Tracking (here\u2019s [a video](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/qizpb5\/the_leap_motion_is_now_the_official_hand_tracking\/) of me using my low FOV leap from 2012, Lynx is using the new leap tracking on wide angle cameras) but they are making touch style controllers with Finchshift for an additional $90. After the kickstarter, the price of the headset (without controllers) will be $549, then after new years it will be $599. The kickstarter ends Tue, at November 9 2021 1:00 PM EST.\n\n[https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/stanlarroque\/lynx](https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/stanlarroque\/lynx)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x03em8vanlx71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1572f525e3cfb43a8d18774e1d0e0bcab79b6bc](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/x03em8vanlx71.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1572f525e3cfb43a8d18774e1d0e0bcab79b6bc)\n\n# Lynx\n\nLynx is a small company, it\u2019s less than 20 people, all engineers.They\u2019ve been designing this device for 2 years with a unique lenses design to make it smaller, a six camera set up to enable hand tracking and AR, and a small form factor. It has the battery in the back for balance (removable but not easily swappable), flips up, and a halo strap design.The resolution is 1600x1600 with two displays and a physical IPD adjustment. Two speakers are built in, with bluetooth and an audio jack. The Lynx has 128GB of storage and a microSD card slot. They initially were going to make the headset for enterprise with eye tracking, which is why they were so absent from the consumer space, then tweaked the design to drop eye tracking and target consumers. Qualcomm and a couple other partners are helping them, and they're in talks with Sidequest (sidequest has confirmed this but talks are under NDA).\n\nI would compare them to Deca pretty favorably. While Deca had great marketing and not much product to show yet, Lynx has the hardware but no marketers. I hope Deca succeeds as well but I appreciate that Lynx has a product.\n\nFor example here's Cas and Cherry [trying it out in Paris and giving their thoughts,](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L8heY7VJBAs)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dn02m81pmlx71.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3056c0adc3141d3fdb7c7b9592b5e01079006a47](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dn02m81pmlx71.jpg?width=1170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3056c0adc3141d3fdb7c7b9592b5e01079006a47)\n\nMy first draft of this had a point about \u201cWhy would I get the Lynx for AR when facebook will probably make a Quest Pro that\u2019s better for AR too?\u201d Lol.\n\nA couple reasons basically, besides the fact that the Quest Pro doesn\u2019t exist and Cambria will cost much more according to both Zuck and Carmack (significantly more expensive\"), they seem to imply it will be more of a Mac Pro device that costs over a thousand dollars.\n\nLynx\u2019s displays make it pretty small, it\u2019s unclear what facebook will have on this front but the Lynx is pretty competitive with its form factor. Lynx is also an open platform and with how experimental AR is, you\u2019d likely see apps that would require a lot of hoop jumping on facebook hardware if they come to it at all.\n\nThe biggest issue with facebook\u2019s AR is an ironic one. Because of how dangerous facebook has shown itself to be again and again, how they like to keep as much control as possible, and how they know that one bad fiasco would tarnish their image, facebook does not allow developers to access either the camera feed or a depth map of your surroundings. This means that developers have to have you define your space each time you run an app, use just your room boundaries, or they can\u2019t add context or awareness at all. That\u2019s a pretty huge limitation for AR and most apps and facebook likely won\u2019t budge. Lynx doesn\u2019t have this official restriction, although I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll add privacy settings, meaning the upward bound on what developers can do is higher than even equivalent hardware from facebook.\n\n&gt;We decided to answer this call by offering a new approach: an open software platform without subscription or mandatory account creation with a clear policy on data privacy. We're also giving developers full control of the distribution of their applications (app store, direct  distribution). We are keeping that philosophy on the hardware side with an open architecture with access to the cameras and sensors and the  possibility to extend the functionalities thanks to its USB-C port.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w86udk86nlx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16686157875fa16ce300ca21a02408d6bc536c93](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w86udk86nlx71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16686157875fa16ce300ca21a02408d6bc536c93)\n\n*Why would I expect any games or software to come to the Lynx?*\n\nOpenXR. Both SteamVR and Facebook Reality Labs are moving to OpenXR as the main API they will ship all features on, and facebook will stop accepting apps that aren\u2019t on OpenXR. As soon as Lynx is OpenXR compliant, developers should be able to easily port their software to it. It\u2019s running on the XR2 chip as well, which means that performance of PC streaming and what games can do is the same as the Quest.\n\nSidequest is taking on Venture Capital investment, implying that they plan to become a kind of Epic Games Store of standalone VR. They are openly in talks with Lynx and it seems like they will be part of their store or a third party option on Lynx too. Discussions about it are under NDA for now.\n\nWhat about facebook\u2019s exclusive games? When those games are openXR, maybe there will be some kind of revive thing, and if devs don\u2019t sign for full exclusivity, coming to other standalones is an important way for them to diversify.\n\nI look at it like an android phone, you don't really need to worry about whether play store apps will work on it.\n\n# Use Cases\n\nIf you want to use the Lynx for VR only and nothing else, it\u2019s a more open, smaller, more expensive Quest 2. Any use cases that facebook bans or restricts will be more accessible on this like Cloud Streaming, some functions of WebXR, using 2D android apps in VR freely, etc. PC streaming should be the same as any other headset. The XR2 is the same as the Quest and once he ports to OpenXR, Guy has said he\u2019s open to porting to whatever headsets he can. Open source options like ALVR should also work on day one. Also the lynx comes with a shroud to stop light leakage, obviously. Get the controllers if you want to play VR, unless you want to use it with your existing lighthouse set up though some mixed tracking hack.\n\nIf you want to use the Lynx for VR but also AR, it has a lot more that it can do on the AR side and devs will have more that they can do. For example, for apps like YUR, which added a fitness tracker to the Quest, facebook locked it behind developer access and then basically broke it many times. With Lynx, those kinds of apps will be much less marginalized and have a lot more access to what they need to stay functional.\n\nFor me this use case is my favorite. It lets you use the device much more seamlessly, moving between sitting and standing and in more spaces since you have high quality passthrough and many apps will be overlaid on the real world in mixed reality.\n\nIf you care more about AR than VR, the lynx is a no brainer. And this could be a fairly serious use case. Think about any VR games where the locomotion isn\u2019t a serious concern, or where you focus on specific things for most of the game. Games like Job Simulator, Cubism, Puzzling Places, Catan, Hand Physics Lab, could all be AR games and the Lynx\u2019s focus is Mixed Reality, seamlessly combining VR and AR.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ca2vi6d5nlx71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d3c6015a5921975e5dfa75586a2f77db0ff89b8](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ca2vi6d5nlx71.png?width=1079&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d3c6015a5921975e5dfa75586a2f77db0ff89b8)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1d3hapg3nlx71.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa65529a0040a3017be190efc3833f62d7a8233](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1d3hapg3nlx71.png?width=1077&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3fa65529a0040a3017be190efc3833f62d7a8233)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0kmyttx3nlx71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7486a2f62e795e10d9264a37cc016a8ceeaae930](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0kmyttx3nlx71.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7486a2f62e795e10d9264a37cc016a8ceeaae930)\n\n*Is this as good as the Meta Quest 2?*\n\nIn some ways, yes, in some ways no. For all the basic stuff it is (put on the headset, pick up controllers, play game, put it away). For some niche feature facebook ships next week it might not be like voice commands or Horizons. They are open about the fact that the community will have to supply some things because they don\u2019t have hundreds of people working on the OS.\n\nThe problem is that this is what a \u201cnon facebook standalone\u201d means. There are maybe a dozen companies big enough to produce a standalone VR headset with the kind of support facebook is providing, but out of them only facebook has a VR headset as its only hardware base. It\u2019s a simple equation, if a company is going to try and own the future, it makes sense to invest comical amounts into the headset they\u2019re using to do that. If they\u2019re not, it doesn't. And at the end of the day the problem with the Quest isn\u2019t the account that\u2019s attached, it\u2019s the future that\u2019s attached, for everyone. So do with that what you will. Also the Lynx has better hand tracking.\n\n*Are you telling me to buy something to make the world a better place?*\n\nNo, buying things is not how change happens. If you want change then don\u2019t use a meta quest or help that platform, push back against \u201cVR at any cost\u201d rhetoric that treats VR as a religion, don't let facebook or the people in their orbit normalize anything they do, take repsponsibility for what VR and AR will do to normal people, and demand change like anti trust and other actions that will weaken large tech platforms. And maybe don\u2019t humor people who act like the .001% of the world with a non facebook headset are the elite and the .01% of the world with a meta quest are the oppressed masses.\n\n[https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/stanlarroque\/lynx](https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/stanlarroque\/lynx)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177815,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"For anyone who has been waiting for a non Facebook standalone headset, meet the Lynx.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.55,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/qmnrmp\/for_anyone_who_has_been_waiting_for_a_non\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"daydreamdist","author_created_utc":1475620498,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":"hasCommented","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":"","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_11w1u0","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1634820526,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"qcr1dg","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_qcr1dg","no_follow":false,"num_comments":47,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/qcr1dg\/varjo_aero_review_the_new_king_of_highend_vr_full\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"OI7RlpkEceN7qzxLVKfDYYVxUJv4vu6P2FinUjeX_7M","resolutions":[{"height":81,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/A2NxkxltGqKM37T2ygwBLtSDnSXJyOKLYj9NE9SxOu8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a48ad94246f9c3f330358404f542c68104fa339e","width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/A2NxkxltGqKM37T2ygwBLtSDnSXJyOKLYj9NE9SxOu8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a1d507991eb50486d9fd7ff55fc9dd312a9815fd","width":216},{"height":240,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/A2NxkxltGqKM37T2ygwBLtSDnSXJyOKLYj9NE9SxOu8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a14acc97061220318dc6e342e5f23c2e2617c5b5","width":320}],"source":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/A2NxkxltGqKM37T2ygwBLtSDnSXJyOKLYj9NE9SxOu8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=cb40cc5b75deb474e2c4235e1002604a59007eb0","width":480},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656121087,"retrieved_utc":1656121087,"score":47,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Dear VR community, \n\nwhat an exciting time for us VR enthusiasts! We have a new toy, the Varjo Aero, a high-end VR headset that is aimed at us consumers!\n\nI had been using the device for weeks now and I wrote an in-depth review about it, that I am going to share with you here. It is a very long read, so if you would prefer to watch it, including through the lens videos and all, you can do so here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q7koPWHkA7U](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q7koPWHkA7U)\n\nBut now, let's do this: \n\nVarjo Aero  The Full MRTV Review\n\nIt is actually happening! Varjo enters the VR consumer market! The Varjo Aero is the company's first ever VR headset that is not strictly aimed at enterprise customers but instead intends to conquer the high-end VR consumer market. And they might actually succeed!\n\nThe Varjo Aero is based on the company's high-end flagship headset for business customers, the VR-3. Varjo kept everything that worked well for gaming, like the impressive visuals achieved by non-glare aspheric lenses and high-resolution panels and stripped the headset off everything that was actually not really needed for a consumer device, like the hand-tracking and the human-resolution focus displays. The latter could not be powered by our current-gen consumer GPUs anyways. Varjo did keep eye-tracking and automatic IPD adjustment though and actually made the device lighter and therefore much more comfortable than its business counterpart.\n\nWith an asking price of 2000\u20ac excl. taxes the Varjo Aero is clearly targeted at the high-end VR enthusiast market. This target audience will for sure appreciate that with the Aero, there also won't be a yearly fee anymore which is still the case for the Varjo business headsets.\n\nThe big question that enthusiasts ask themselves now of course: Is the device as good as the VR-3? The answer is no...It is actually \\*better\\*. Find out in this review why that is the case and if you should consider to upgrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuild Quality &amp; Comfort\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the basics, build quality and comfort.\n\nThe build-quality and materials used are top-notch. The Aero is a well-built high-end device that feels just as premium as the VR-3. That does not come as a surprise though since both headsets use exactly the same casing that even features woven fabric parts instead of an all-plastic enclosure like most of the competition. From the outside, you can still distinguish the two headsets though because the Aero only needs one cable whereas the VR-3 still needed two of them. That also means instead of two DP ports and two USB ports like with the VR-3, now only one DP port and a single USB port are needed to connect the Aero to a gaming PC.\n\nOf course, a single cable also benefits comfort and ease of use. Comfort is an especially important aspect here since the Aero is clearly aimed at the high-end simmer community, at users that want to wear the device for hours and hours at a time.\n\nThe VR-3 did a good job with comfort but the weight was without a doubt the limiting factor. Even though the balancing was good, you could still tell that you are wearing quite a heavy device.\n\nThe Aero is much lighter than the VR-3. Because there is no more hand-tracking and no more focus-displays, the device is now 300g lighter and weighs only around 500g. Since the halo strap is still the same and does a great job at balancing the headset, the Aero is a very comfortable device to wear also for long playing sessions.\n\nThe halo-style headstrap allows for a very precise 3-point adjustment. Users can adjust size at the back, like most headsets, at the front part that sits on the user's forehead and there is even an angle-adjustment at the sides that allows the headset to perfectly fit the user's face. I had not yet come across a headstrap that would allow for so many adjustments.\n\nOnce you understand what you can do with it, you will be able to find the right fit. But it does take quite a bit longer to find the perfect fit than it does with other headstraps. It is just not as simple and straight forward. Moreover, I am missing the functionality of being able to tilt the whole headstrap up like with the Reverb G2. I have quite a big head and at the very beginning, it was kind of hard for me to actually get into the device because of this missing feature. People with even bigger heads might have even more problems and need to make sure the headstrap can work for their headsize at all. For the next generation of Varjo headstraps, there is without a doubt room for improvements, especially for larger head sizes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisuals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we get to the major selling point of the Varjo Aero: the visuals! These are the best visuals I have ever seen in a VR headset - Period! Virtual worlds even look better than in the VR-3 and that is quite a feat! When I first looked through the Varjo VR-3 months ago, I was extremely excited because virtual worlds simply looked photorealistic and it is the same with the Aero. Exploring Half-Life: Alyx with the Aero is simply a game changer. Never before could you experience that living and breathing world more immersive than with the Aero. The same is true for sims like MSFS. This is so close to the real thing that you might completely forget about the real world outside of the Aero. Visuals are absolutely amazing. And: this time around the displays are even noticeably brighter than they were in the VR-3.\n\nVisuals in VR are highly dependent on displays and lenses. For the Aero we simply have a winning combination of both. Let's have a closer look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLenses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Varjo Aero uses the same custom-made aspheric lenses as seen in the VR-3. Aspheric lenses are those clear lenses that completely lack the concentric rings that Fresnel lenses are known for. Because of that, you will absolutely not be distracted by god rays that headsets like the Valve Index are plagued with. It's beautiful and such a huge difference, you can completely get immersed in the virtual worlds and there is nothing that would distract you from that.\n\nThe aspheric lenses also make a difference as far as sweetspot and edge-to-edge clarity are concerned. Not once did I have to adjust the headset's position in order to find the sweetspot where everything looks clear. You will always find it directly when putting on the Aero. Also the edge-to-edge clarity is better than in competing Fresnel lens headsets, meaning that you have a clear image not only in the center of the displays but also when you look around within the headset. Does it have the perfect edge-to-edge clarity? No, but image quality does not decrease as fast as with Fresnel lenses in the peripheral areas. However, the further you get to the edges, the more of chromatic aberration you will see here as well, but again, compared to Fresnel, this is just so much better in so many ways.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the lenses being able to do such a fantastic job is that they are always correctly aligned to the user's eyes thanks to automatic IPD adjustment. It is pretty incredible that Varjo kept the eye tracking functionality in the Aero. When you put on the device you have to focus on a little dot and then your IPD gets measured. The lenses are then moved into the perfect position by the built-in motors. It's nothing short of spectacular and the optics are just perfectly in place every single time.\n\nAspheric lenses do not only have advantages though. They introduce optical distortions and that is actually the reason why most VR headsets now use Fresnel lenses.\n\nWhen I reviewed the VR-3 these optical distortions were very visible. There was quite a bit of horizontal barrel distortion when looking up and down, like a bulge moving through the picture. And toward the edges of the display, you could see quite a bit of warping, as in the image moving faster there than in the other parts of the image.\n\nAnd that is exactly what I was expecting when I first turned on the Aero. But all these problems were so dramatically improved upon that I don't think normal users would even notice them at all. This improvement is just so incredibly important as it allows Aero owners to fully enjoy the breathtaking visuals without any distractions.\n\nHow did they do it? Varjo has improved the so called lens distortion profile, which is an important part of a software solution that pre-distorts the image before it travels through the lenses into the user's eye. It's still not as perfect as a Valve Index, but again, most people will not notice but just enjoy the perfect clarity of the lenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisplay\n\nThe other part of the equation are the two displays that are being used. We are talking about two Mini LED LCD 90hz panels with a resolution of 2880 x 2720 pixels per eye. Just to get an idea about how high of a resolution that actually is: the Reverb G2, which stunned us with its fantastic visuals last year only has a resolution of 2160 x 2160 pixels and the Valve Index would only give us 1440 x 1600 pixels per eye. And in conjunction with the aspheric lenses we talked about, those high-resolution displays just shine.\n\n(Reminder: Through the lens videos here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q7koPWHkA7U](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q7koPWHkA7U) If you want this text with pictures, go here: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/10\/varjo-aero-review-the-new-king-of-high-end-vr\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/10\/varjo-aero-review-the-new-king-of-high-end-vr\/) )\n\nAnd you could take that quite literally. In direct comparison with the VR-3, the Aero looks brighter and colors even look a tad better than on the big brother. But how could that actually be the case when they are using exactly the same displays?\n\nWell, the answer lies in the missing focus displays. As mentioned before, the VR-3 even sports additional human-eye resolution focus displays that are projected into the middle of the standard displays. In order not see color differences between those displays, color adjustments had to be made on both panels, not allowing to unleash the full potential of either display as far as colors are concerned. The lowest common denominator had to be found and that compromise is now not needed anymore with the Aero. That is also the reason why the Aero is now double (!) as bright as the VR-3 and XR-3.\n\nColors are incredibly vibrant, just like on an OLED panel. It is actually surprising to see just how good colors look like on this panel. Contrasts are incredibly high which allows for bright and shiny colors also on dark backgrounds with very good black levels.\n\nAnd yes, you read that right in the beginning of this review, these are Mini LED LCD panels, the same technology as used in the new Macbook Pro displays. That means that there is not just one big backlight that is turned on all the time like with standard LCD panels, making blacks more of a grey, but that certain zones can be lit whenever needed and others simply turned off when deep blacks should be shown.\n\nNow currently, the technology is actually not used to its full potential and that is probably also why Varjo did not advertise this feature for the VR-3. Right now backlight zones are turned on and off in rows like a rolling shutter to improve latency by 5 ms. That is for sure a nice feature but it gets really exciting once dark areas will actually be dimmed to give us OLED like blacks. Right now, blacks are as good as the best LCD panels on the market but this headset even has so much more potential down the line and I am excited about that future upgrade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOV\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe FOV of the Aero is a bit wider than the standard FOV that you are used to when coming from an Oculus headset or the Reverb G2 for example. Varjo says it is 115\u00b0 horizontal and while that may be theoretically correct, in my practical measurements using the ROV test environment I got to 100\u00b0 horizontal and 76\u00b0 vertical. If you are used to bigger FOVs like the ones provided by the Pimax headsets or even by the Pro 2 though you will not be impressed by the FOV of the Aero.\n\nChances are high though that the sheer visual quality that the Aero offers will simply draw all of your attention and will make for a wonderful immersion. That was the case for me and I am pretty sure many of you will feel the same. You just have to check out those visuals for yourself. In a nutshell, the FOV is alright but nothing to write home about. If you are looking for the widest FOVs on the market go for the Pimax headsets. If you simply want the best picture quality that is available to consumers right now together with incredible colors, best sweetspot and no god rays at all, it's the Aero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAudio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust as the VR-3, the Aero does not come with a built-in audio solution like we are used to from competing headsets. Unlike the VR-3, Varjo does add in-ear headphones into the box though which also include a microphone. This is a serviceable solution that works, but without a doubt I would have preferred built-in headphones.\n\nHeadphones\n\nThe in-ear headphones do sound good though and once you put them into your ears you will most likely not think about them anymore. They offer good-enough sound throughout the audio spectrum and are without doubt not just some cheap plastic in-ears that you will find with many smartphones these days.\n\nThey directly plug into the 3.5m headphone jack that the Aero offers, so should you not like that audio solution, you can of course go with your own high-end headphones. Varjo tells me that this is what enterprise customers normally prefer. Well, the consumer market is without a doubt very different here and for the next Aero installment for sure we will need a better audio solution.\n\nMicrophone\n\nThe microphone is part of the in-ear headphones, so the Aero comes with a 3.5mm audio + mic combined jack. The microphone sounds alright but certainly nowhere near as good as the one of the Valve Index. Again, audio is not the strong suit of the Aero, it is all about the visuals.\n\n \n\nController \/ Tracking\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Aero is fully compatible with the Valve Lighthouse tracking system. In order to use the Aero, you will need the Lighthouse base stations and compatible controllers, like for example the Valve Index controllers or the Vive Wands.\n\nLighthouse tracking is still the best tracking that is available to consumers and VR enthusiasts will likely already own a set of compatible controllers and base stations.\n\nShould that not be the case controllers and base stations still need to be purchased for around $600, that's for the Valve Index controllers and two Lighthouse base stations, that are actually hard to come by.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance \/ Compatibility\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill you be able to run the Aero on your system? I understand that is the question on your mind right now. The answer is, if you are a VR enthusiast that is already invested in one of the top tier headsets like the Reverb G2 or the Vive Pro 2, most likely yes. Just to remind you: the Pro 2 has a resolution of around 2.5k x 2.5k per eye, so nearly as high as the Aero and the Pro 2 runs well on most systems.\n\nThe minimum system requirements are an RTX2080 or RTX3070. I personally ran the Aero on a 3080 without any performance problems playing standard SteamVR games like Half-Life: Alyx, Skyrim, Boneworks, DCS, and also MSFS. Unfortunately, only Nvidia GPUs are supported, so if your system runs on an AMD GPU you will either need to get a new GPU or simply sit this one out.\n\nOn my system, I reached an OpenVR Benchmark score of 30 fps. With the Reverb G2 as direct comparison, I got 28 fps, so a very comparable result. Of course, this score will always depend on the render resolution and for this test, we went for SteamVR SS at 100%, just as the benchmark tool would require from us. If you got a 3080 as well, you could run the OpenVR benchmark with your current headset to find out how much better or worse the Aero would run on your system.\n\nAs far as compatibility is concerned, I had absolutely no problems at all running all of my SteamVR library. Everything simply ran without any problems at all. I am using the Aero with Valve Index controllers and also on that front everything just worked as expected. Just as the OpenVR Benchmark results suggested, I got similar fps on the Aero and the Reverb G2.\n\nI did make out one difference though and that was when running certain Oculus games through Revive. Everything worked as expected and most games ran as well as on other Non-Oculus headsets through Revive. However, for some games I simply could not get to 90 fps even though that did work on the Reverb G2 without any problems. I have not tried all of my Oculus games but Lone Echo 1 and Defector for example were affected by that problem.\n\nThe Aero does not run as a pure SteamVR headset. Just like with the Pimax headsets or the Vive Pro 2, you need to install another piece of software. This software is called Varjo Base and it allows you to fine tune your VR Experience. You can set the visual fidelity, enable or disable OpenXR \/ OpenVR compatibility, enable or disable automatic IPD adjustment and many more things. The software feels mature and powerful and would probably deserve a whole article by itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are simply looking for the best visuals in VR right now, the Aero is your next headset. It's the new King of Clarity and takes the reign from the Reverb G2, especially thanks to the phenomenal lenses that make god rays a thing of the past.\n\nVirtual worlds look as good as they have never looked before, I would even use the term photorealistic, if textures can hold up. Looking at objects in the Aero is comparable to looking at the pages of a glossy magazine, there is absolutely no chance anymore to see any kind of screen door effect, even if you try hard to find it. Colors also can live up to the glossy magazine comparison and the potential of true blacks thanks to the MiniLED technology is only a software update away.\n\nVisuals are so compelling because of the combination of fantastic panels and custom made aspheric lenses. The choice of lenses can make or break visuals of a VR headset and with the Aero, Varjo shows that they absolutely understand the importance of how panels and lenses form the overall visuals of a VR headset.\n\nWith the Aero you simply want to retry all of your games, just to find out how good they actually could look like. The Aero is without a doubt a must have for simmers that simply want to make their experiences as real as possible and that need to see the smallest details also in further distances when other headsets would only give them a blurry mess.\n\nBut it's also a great buy for those enthusiasts who simply want a visual upgrade for their current headset and enjoy Half-Life Alyx or other non-sim games and simply want VR to look as good as it is possible right now.\n\nHowever, it's not all just moonlight and roses. The audio solution feels like a compromise. It surely works but consumers are already used to better, built-in headphones like in the Valve Index or the Reverb G2.\n\nAlso in terms of comfort you can tell that Varjo still did not have to face the wild west of the consumer market with users that would put the hardware to all kinds of unexpected tests. The headstrap is very sophisticated but might give users a few too many options for adjustment. But my major gripe with the headstrap is that it is too small for really big head sizes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you are in the market for a new headset and belong to the kind of VR enthusiast that in general would be willing to pay 2k to simply get the best visuals in VR right now that are not compromised by any godrays and offer absolutely stunning clarity from edge to edge, you absolutely have my blessing to go forward and order the Aero! Just be aware of the fact that like with most headsets, also the Aero is not without its compromises. \n\nI have a full upgrade guide up on my website, with full upgrade recommendations for all major headsets, comparing the Aero with your current headset. You can check that out here: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/10\/varjo-aero-review-the-new-king-of-high-end-vr\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/10\/varjo-aero-review-the-new-king-of-high-end-vr\/) \n\nAnd this concludes the the full MRTV review of the Varjo Aero! I am glad that Varjo took the plunge into consumer VR and with a product like the Aero, they will for sure make a big splash! This is the headset so many people have been waiting for and now it\u2019s here. PCVR is alive and kicking and with the Aero we have a new front-runner for the race to the top. \n\nHope you enjoyed this review!\n\nBye, Sebastian","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177813,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Varjo Aero Review - The New King Of High-End VR (Full MRTV Review)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/qcr1dg\/varjo_aero_review_the_new_king_of_highend_vr_full\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Solarias99","author_created_utc":1551798862,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3ccj1yq3","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1633136573,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"pzl9kt","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"hdw automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_pzl9kt","no_follow":false,"num_comments":9,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/pzl9kt\/weird_3d_feeling_after_using_vr_headset\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656137177,"retrieved_utc":1656137177,"score":5,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey all.\n\nSo i've recently got a VR headset and i've been using it quite a bit.

And yes, ive tried a cable pulley system, but the yank on the back of my head was too immersion breaking for me. Ive also tried the quest 2 wireless with airlink and virtual desktop, but the latency and picture degredation\/ bad contrast made that headset unusable for me. And before the quest fanboys pipe up , i bought a dedicated wifi 6 router and did all the tweaks for DAYS, and the lowest i could get the latency was around 20ms, which is too much for me. Completely immersion breaking, anyways\u2026.on to the Vive line comparison\n\nOG vive - excellent feeling of immersion, contrast is excellent (OLED!), screen door effect is BAD. That is easily the worst part of this headset, it can be immersion breaking when looking through the lenses. After 4 years i have learned to ignore it. This headset has a small fov for sure. Its similar to looking through a pipe or something lol. But over time your brain tends to forget about it and focus on the objects in game rather than staring at the edges of the lenses the whole time. Overall this has been an excellent headset, but now on to the \u201cupgrades\u201d\n\nVive pro 1 - this thing is a straight up upgrade to the OG vive in every way: better resolution, not dramatic, but definitely noticeable. Easier to read text, see in distance, etc. screen door is improved on this headset, not removed, but improved a decent amount. It is still there, but a clear improvement over the original. This headset provides the same great contrast from the OG Vive (Oled). In my opinion it is more comfortable as well, the strap really holds this thing on so you can jump around to your hearts content. The feeling of immersion is on par with OG vive if not better, due to less SDE and better resolution. The overall clarity is very good. Sweet spot is small but i have yet to try a headset that is perfectly clear outside of the sweetspot anyways. Fov feels the same as original vive. If you have to pick between OG Vive and Vive pro one (and money is no object!), definitely go with vive pro 1. It is better in every way. worth 800$? No. Find it used or on sale and youll be happy. Cant afford it? No problem, OG vive kits can be found for cheap on ebay, and if this is your first PCVR headset, youll have a great time with it\n\nNow on to the latest and \u201cgreatest\u201d\n\nVive Pro 2 - I honestly dont know how to feel about this headset\u2026in some ways it is excellent, in some ways it is awful. Let me explain\n\nFirst thing i noticed when putting it on is \u201cHOLY SHIT LOOK AT THAT RESOLUTION\u201d. To my eyes there is almost no perceivable screen door effect. I mean if you have good vision and you reeeeallly try you can see it. But in game it completely disappears. Contrast is actually really good for an LCD screen, its not OLED, but they managed to keep the colors looking pretty good. The one exception to this is in dark areas. Its grey more than it is black. This also seems to depend on the game. In Elite Dangerous the black void of space actually looks pretty good. Again, not Oled level blacks, but pretty good. But then for some reason in games like half life alyx and pavlov (on dark maps) the blacks look very grey and washed out which is a HUGE immersion breaker for me, especially coming from OLED screens from the vive and vive pro 1.  This may not seem like a big deal until you are in a very dark area and you cant make out any detail at all, making some areas of HL alyx pretty much unplayable. Very strange because in elite dangerous its much better. Maybe because your ship HUD lights up part of the screen? Im not sure. One strange thing about these lenses is that they are dual stack Fresnel as opposed to the single layer fresnels of the vive and vive pro 1. To me, these lenses cause too much light to bounce around in between the layers and it can cause things to have a glare or look washed out. \n\nLets talk about clarity for a minute, to me, that means how clear the image looks. For some reason, even though this headset has a super high resolution, things still look more \u201cclear\u201d on the vive pro 1. This is probably due to a variety of factors, glare from lenses, less contrast, less brightness than OLED, etc. whatever the reason, the high resolution feels wasted because its still not all that clear looking. The exception to this is if youre in a game where everthing is brightly colored and vivid (no dark areas), in this case it is very clear. But start introducing scenes with dark areas, low contrast scenes, or strange lighting effects and clarity drops dramatically.\n\nFOV is dramatically improved horizontally, slightly reduced vertically but that doesnt really bother me in this headset. But the fov increase comes at a HUGE cost. Binocular overlap is the worst i have ever seen in any headset. When i first put it on i though my headset was broken lol. Im right eye dominant so i end up seeing the edge of my right lens in the middle of the left side of the perceived screen. This is something that is hard to explain, but imagine wearing glasses and looking to your left or right. You can see the edge of the inside of your glasses frame, you can see through it, because your other eye is picking up the visual data from behind the edge of your glasses, but you still see it. Hope that makes some sense lol. You really have to try it to know what i mean. You can probably do this with your existing headset, my original vive has a very small overlap effect, where maybe 10 percent of the screen is separated by this effect, but the vive pro 2 has about a 30 percent separation effect.This was a massive immersion breaker at first, and although i have gotten used to it more, i really, really wish it wasnt there. This is due to lense design. The lenses are further from each other. \n\nAlso, this thing is HEAVY. Easily most uncomfortable hmd ive tried just due to weight alone. And yes, it gets hot, but that doesnt bother me as i am not a sweaty person so that part isnt a deal breaker\n\nOver all, i really dont know what to do here. I have a few more weeks with the headsets until i have to return one. Im keeping my og vive for sure. Ive had it for 4 years so its not worth much in resale. So i either need to keep the vp1, or keep the vp2 , or send em both back. I cant afford to keep both. The vp1 is a great improvemt over the og, but for 800$??? Idk if i can justify that. The Vp2 is a huge step up in fov and resolution, but im not sure if its worth all the drawbacks that come with the headset.\n\nMy brain over the last week:\n\n\u201cThe res, refresh rate and fov of the vive pro 2 is great! But the overall clarity isnt at all what it should be for this price. Plus\u2026that damned binocular overlap\n\nI love the vp1 clarity, but idk if i can let go of the fov\/refresh rate\/ resolution of the vive pro 2\n\nUgh, maybe i should return the vp1 and vp2 and just stick with the OG cause they are way too expensive, and their price is not nearly worth the experience you get\u201d\n\nThis repeats over and over in my brain haha. I almost wish i lived in a world where i never decided to try some upgrades, and i could go back to my blissful ignorance of being an og vive owner.\n\nIve been driving myself insane over the last week testing and trying to decide what to do, but there really isnt a clear winner here. If these headsets were cheaper id prob just keep both and call it a day, but they are 800 bucks each which i think is completely insane. They should be 400 bucks each. If the vp2 was an improvement in every way then hell id pay 1000 bucks for it, but its simply not. It has taken steps forward in vr hardware and steps backwards. \n\nThoughts?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177814,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My thoughts on Vive vs Vive Pro vs Vive Pro 2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.95,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/pkdyk6\/my_thoughts_on_vive_vs_vive_pro_vs_vive_pro_2\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"preauxinvestor","author_created_utc":1611704307,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_9apv2zhe","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1629922507,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1630095799.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"pbjece","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_pbjece","no_follow":true,"num_comments":28,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/pbjece\/vive_pro_2_reviewish\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656171473,"retrieved_utc":1656171473,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Just got vive pro 2 couple days ago, had vive pro and before that vive.\n\nUpgrading to vive pro from vive was mixed, I had deluxe audio strap, and damn was that thing comfy with great tracking.

I can definitely tell its higher res, but its not high enough to not see pixels I can see them easy still.\n\nSo far I miss vp everytime I'm in it, which sucks... oh build quality is a bit better on vp2, at least vs my vive pros (me and gf have one) but bought em close to launch.\n\nJust ordered gear VR lens so that should tip things in vp favor even more...\n\nI am currently using vp2 with living room pc that has 1080ti, so I'll be running cables from my 3080 pc soon, and I'm testing for a full 30 days before sending back. May just swap for vive pro eye if I don't like it and give my old vp to a buddy, unless index 2 or something is launching soon.\n\nUpdate: visuals is a tricky subject, I personally don't think trading clarity and less distortion and glare is worth an upgrade in resolution. So yes, vp2 is def high resolution, and if you look at certain things just right without moving, it will look better, arguable depending on the scene with glare and higher black levels but still definitely more detailed in some scenes. \n\nI personally can't stand washed out images for instance, it bothers the crap out of me, aka oled vs lcd, although this is a nice lcd, but with vp2 not only are you going lcd but you also add a LOT of glare and distortion, I've tested with 3 very different body types, we all want to like our shiny new toys but it's a visual downgrade in several ways. In a vr setting I have a hard time understanding how this is an upgrade.\n\nUpdate 2: if you play intensive games the vp2 moves side to side and up and down about twice as much as vp1, confirmed by others, this is due to increased weight. Pair this with bad distortion if headset moves on top of already bad distortion on edges and the horrivle glare it's not a good vr headset, it might be a good vr demo headset, or strictly for making alyx look better, but if you actually play vr I can't see anyone preferring this headset. I'll update if anything changes.\n\nUpdate 3: I am waiting till my knuckles arrive to play alyx. I will switch between vive pro and pro 2 every play session on 3080 10700k rig.\n\nUpdate 4: ordered 10mm face pad foam, and upgraded padding for entire headset, after the aggro posts (some now deleted) this face pad better make it at least 50% better but I have my doubts! If so then VR review channels are terribad which also wouldn't surprise me much.\n\nUpdate 5: I can easily read bottom row on eye chart, it's beyond 20\/20 I forget what they call it, so if you have worse near sighted vision maybe it's issues will be less to you. I also read silk print and work on circuit boards a lot.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177811,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive pro 2...

All of my games work  when I launch them through the headset's interface. They work when I  launch them from steam on my desktop. But getting anything to work  outside of that interface isn't happening. I've tried watching some VR  videos from my browser, but they always direct me to find a VR-enabled  browser. I've tried Firefox, Chrome, and even Edge. Also, I've been trying to play Star Wars Squadrons through EA Play. It shows the option to toggle to VR, but when I choose to do so, the game stops showing  video, and my headset shows no signs of trying to switch to the  application.\n\nIt feels like maybe  the files were installed to steam, but there weren't any associations  made with the rest of my pc to let it know that I have a headset. That's  probably not how things work, but it's how it feels.\n\nSome more context, maybe it helps. I've tried rerunning the Vive setup,  but it seems to stall out and never move on past a certain point. Last time, it said it was installing steam, though I already have steam.\n\nI originally installed Viveport on my C drive while I have steam on my D drive. I did move my Vive and Viveport files from C to D, but it doesn't seem to have solved anything. Think that might be causing issues?\n\nAny ideas?

So I am not leaving a negative review on the game. The game is fun an quirky and I really enjoy it. Especially on my Vive Pro 1 and Valve Index.\n\nHowever, the Vive Pro 2 has one seriously bad draw back to it's lens design. Glare in high contrast scenarios. It's one of the worst I have ever seen. Maybe even the worst.  And this game has so many black screen\/white text moments that I cannot play it without getting a headache and eye strain when using my Vive Pro 2. The glare causes so much image distortion that it's nearly unbearable after 30 minutes. I am constantly angling and moving my head and eyes, to try and keep where I am reading glare free, that it strains my eyes to point of serious pain. \n\nI have been playing VR for over 1800 hours total (actual hours, not SteamVR hours) and have never experienced this with any other headset. I stand by my comments that I like the Vive Pro 2 overall but, this glare is seriously not acceptable and they need to resolve it. There's no way in hell this or Focus 3 is going to be successful in  a business environment when reading contrasting text is so painful. \n\nAgain, Cooking Simulator VR is fun and I highly recommend it.

all,\n\nI see people are sharing their experiences with these mods which helped me a lot in improving my setup and I want to pass mine along hoping it would help others. Any suggestions are much appreciated.\n\nThis is my first VR headset and I've been using it for about 200+ hours (bought it at the end of May this year, about 70 days ago). I have a Dropbox folder with pics of the mods (my previous account got shadowbanned after trying to post this, so not sure how I can share them with you without risking another one so I removed all links).\n\nL.E.: here goes nothing :)\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/BRIhEo4](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/BRIhEo4)\n\n***TL,DR: all is great after I set up everything perfectly: dialed in the exact IPD to match my eyes*** *(measurement then trial &amp; error until I got the best comfort - eye strain is a sign of incorrect adjustment)****, added SteamVR -6mm IPD offset to regain the original 3D effect and further reduce eye strain, adjusted SteamVR world scale*** *(I use \\~90% for my height, 1.8m)****, used lowest latency PCIe slot*** *(one with direct CPU lanes)****, chose best super-sampling % to avoid reprojection, disabled motion smoothing, used a monitoring tool like fpsVR to check performance and readjust as needed.***\n\nGaming rig specs:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* ASUS ROG Strix Z490-F Gaming motherboard;\n* Intel Core i7 10700K (35% BIOS AI OC by manually setting cooler score to 195);\n* Noctua NH-D15S air-cooler;\n* Corsair Vengeance 2x16GB 3200GHz 16-19-19-36;\n* ASUS TUF Gaming RTX 3070 OC (MSI OC Scanner Curve);\n* Corsair TX750M, 80+ Gold.\n\nGearVR lens mod:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* used the lens form a black GearVR headset I own (R323 model);\n* took into account which was left\/right;\n* 3D printed **Version 4** of Thingiverse **GearVR to Vive Lens Adapter** by GrodenVR (link removed);\n* did my best to install them as centered as possible (they were not a snug fit);\n* used **ProV25** distortion profile that\u2019s linked in the Thingiverse thing description;\n* before removing the original lenses, I thoroughly cleaned the eye facing side of the HMD and used a hand dust blower to take out any specs of dust around the original lenses before removing them;\n* I kept the HMD with the lenses facing down while doing the whole exchange operation and I managed to get a clean swap.\n\nVIVE Wireless installation and mods:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* PCIe WiGig card is installed in the second x16 PCIe v3 slot because it has lanes running directly to the CPU;\n* GPU now dropped to x8, but it was the only slot where I got no noticeable latency;\n* WiGig antenna is installed on the wall, 2m high from the floor, using Thingiverse **Vive Wireless Adapter Wall Mount** by bayalin;\n* antenna is pointed towards the middle of my 2 x 2.5m play space, angled down a little bit lower than my face to have good reception also while crouching;\n* wireless receiver is actively cooled using Thingiverse **VIVE Wireless - Fan &amp; Battery Bracket** by Tusktopia and 2 Noctua NF-A4x10 5V fans with 2 diodes in series to drop down the fan speed. Fans      are powered from the front facing USB port.\n\nOther mods:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I removed those horrible sounding, heavy headphones;\n* I installed a pair of USB-C Samsung AKG earbuds that come with Galaxy S20 phones. They sound great, with very decent bass (by using the biggest earbud seals I could find for my ears, from some      SONY earbuds), good mids and excellent highs (with minor tweaks in Equalizer APO);\n* Equalizer APO personal config: Preamp gain -6db, Graphic EQ \"63 2, 125 -4, 250 -2, 2000 2, 4000 4, 8000 4, 16000 4\";\n* Cable managed all wires using self-adhesive Velcro straps and textile electrical tape;\n* I wrapped 2 layers of textile electrical tape on the IPD adjustment knob to prevent unwanted adjustments while rapidly moving my head around or accidentally hitting the HMD.\n\nI'm now at a point where I'm happy with the setup, but I feel it took a while to get there.\n\nThe lens mod is great. Image is clear almost edge to edge, but the new lenses are very unforgiving if you set them wrong. First time I installed them and put the headset on I was wowed by the clarity, complete lack of god-rays and the minimal glare (as the lenses are not anti-reflex coated you still get minimal glare in high contrast scenes), but immediately felt eye strain, only to discover that I was using a much higher IPD setting (3mm more than the right value for my eyes). I also felt like the image was flat, lacking 3D depth, and everything around me looked bigger, but I solved this with some offsets (described below):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* To measure my IPD correctly, I took a clear ruler, held it right in front of my eyes, stared in the distance and shot a selfie then used the photo to accurately measure it. I got 65mm, but I      have to set the VIVE Pro to 65.5mm for best comfort. To do this and prevent accidental readjustments, even with the electrical tape on the knob, I use fpsVR's **Interpupillary Distance** menu to see the value in real time. I first adjust to a higher IPD, then start lowering and stop about 1mm before my IPD. I then tap the HMD and watch as the value goes down and stop tapping when it reaches my desired value. It seems like the whole screen\/lens assembly moves, and tapping the HMD stabilizes them somehow. I then look at the text in this menu and adjust the HMD on my face (up\/down, left\/right, tilt) until text is clear with no smudges or chromatic aberrations - it may sound tedious, but it only takes a few seconds.\n* To correct for 3D depth, I played around with the SteamVR IPD offset which you can easily adjust with fpsVR in the Interpupillary Distance menu then use the app's Restart SteamVR option to      apply the new offset. I went to extremes like +10, +20, -10, -20 to get the feel of the setting. My best experience is with **-6mm** offset. You will screw up world scale pretty badly, but luckily SteamVR v1.18 now has individual World Scale adjustment for each game. This offset also completely removed eye strain for me. I can play for hours, and after removing the headset my eyes don't need to readjust.\n* Using a negative IPD offset made everything around me even bigger and disproportionate. You can now correct this in the SteamVR Video Settings menu for each game. In HL:Alyx for example, I      used a door's height as a reference and adjusted the world scale % until it corresponded to a real world door height. For me, this was at about 89%, and after setting this value, everything around me felt right again. This value works in other games too (sometimes I may adjust it      differently, like \u00b11-2%)\n\nVIVE Wireless was another adventure to get it working right. It comes with 2 downsides, but I'm ok with them:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Image is obviously degraded, but having the GearVR lens mod installed, I now understand how they managed to compress and broadcast all that \"high res\" data with no noticeable latency: image is nice and crisp in the central part of the screen, and it slowly starts to degrade in quality until it becomes a pixelated mess as it reaches the edge of the screen. It looks like fixed foveated rendering that was easily masked by the rapidly degrading clarity of the Fresnel lenses. Image quality was identical regardless of the slot chosen for the WiGig card.\n* Light-blue screens: I tried all fixes suggested across the forums. They don't prevent or reduce the occurrences. I get a big 10-20s drop maybe once per session, and I just have to wait for it to      pass. In the vast majority of the times it happens, I don't have to do anything, I just wait. In rare cases, the image goes black and doesn't come back, and I just change the channel from the Wireless app and then continue playing (I don't have to restart anything or disconnect and      reconnect power). Right after this event, I get a phantom HMD update notification in SteamVR. More frequent are the light-blue screens that last only a few seconds. I think there is some sort of overload going on when this happens. The CPU probably doesn't have any data ready to be sent      to the headset. I managed to get glimpses of the fpsVR dashboard that is attached on my left wrist, and I did see thick red CPU spikes just before the light-blue screen appeared.\n\nI first installed the WiGig card in the only unobstructed PCIe x1 slot I had available (which is the 3'rd one away from the CPU of a total of 3) as the one closest to the CPU was blocked by the huge air-cooler. Coming from the wired experience, it was immediately obvious there was latency and I felt disconnected and conscious I was looking at a screen and remote controlling my VR avatar. It was bearable, and I used it like that for a good number of days, but I always felt disoriented when coming out of VR, and that feeling only went away after 2-3 days. I took the plunge and modified my cooler by cutting the corners of 2 fins to be able to fit the card in the x1 slot closest to the CPU, but the improvement was only marginal or maybe just placebo. That same feeling of disconnect persisted.\n\nThen, one evening, after a week of switching back and forth between wireless and wired, I decided to make one last test, and moved the card in the second x16 slot, the one that shares lanes with the GPU and is directly connected to the CPU. I didn't have high hopes, but 2 things happened:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I immediately felt completely immersed in the VR world. Then I realized it's not the image degradation that made me feel disconnected, but the latency. In this configuration, I almost feel      latency is a bit better than wired, or maybe it's from the added benefit of not feeling the wire tugging on the back of my head. It was like flipping a switch and getting an instant feeling of presence. I wear glasses for mild astigmatism, but not in VR, and playing wireless is like having my glasses on but a bit dirty and maybe smudgy at the edges, but perfectly usable. Switching to wired felt like wearing my glasses after cleaning them.\n* GPU performance in VR was a bit affected. Nothing noticeable in desktop games though. The best way I can compare performance is by how much I can super-sample in Aircar: wired I could go to 1.8 before reprojection occurred; wireless, through a chipset connected (PCH) PCIe slot, I could go to 1.5-1.6 before reprojecting; wireless through the CPU connected PCIe slot I could only go to 1.3-1.4. But even with the performance hit, the sense of presence just wins above everything else.\n\nThis turned out to be quite long :).","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177812,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro, Wireless and GearVR lens mod - impressions, experiences and workarounds","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.9,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/obnpzd\/vive_pro_wireless_and_gearvr_lens_mod_impressions\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Aggressive-Hair9522","author_created_utc":1603990264,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_6ccthwjd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1624900057,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1624900444.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o9onh0","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"vd","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":"Video","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o9onh0","no_follow":false,"num_comments":27,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o9onh0\/vp2_to_8kx_my_review_comparison\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"2JmgwPdURAN1BqQP7SCvCuhbAJVO1mtvfao_alFOkFE","resolutions":[{"height":81,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/J5sG8KGwIwbt3_6Qmx1jc3-V_2tGfPCyDYD9YIqNHAs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ba2ac3e87c3c552ca4cc3598a7fd9637d638f8f","width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/J5sG8KGwIwbt3_6Qmx1jc3-V_2tGfPCyDYD9YIqNHAs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=102d4b40e3a59434e3b269f2e04934870a5356c5","width":216},{"height":240,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/J5sG8KGwIwbt3_6Qmx1jc3-V_2tGfPCyDYD9YIqNHAs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b831a333c6a71b1964dcb9cfbec7fdb51f70ea1","width":320}],"source":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/J5sG8KGwIwbt3_6Qmx1jc3-V_2tGfPCyDYD9YIqNHAs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=97d2b3eda502db45bcbac55082e467fa8525421b","width":480},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1626775693,"score":20,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Review:  [Vive Pro 2 to 8KX, mostly blown away with a few issues. : Pimax (reddit.com)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Pimax\/comments\/o9c9xq\/vive_pro_2_to_8kx_mostly_blown_away_with_a_few\/)\n\n**Review summary:**\n\n(Backstory: I've owned the Index for over a year before upgrading to Reverb G2, and then, no longer willing to deal with WMR problem (such as randomly locking up my PC, even with a PCI-E USB card) I upgraded to VP2 a few weeks ago, and that was a genuine upgrade, but the marginal increase in HFOV (from 100 \/ 92 to 112 \/ 90) only left me craving even more FOV. Then Pimax announced a 20% off sale and I caved and what I'm asking myself is, why did I even bother with the VP2 at all (see updated review summary at the bottom for through the lens comparison)?\n\nNote: 90 Hz works with newer display drivers, you simply need to contact Pimax customer support and request their beta firmware and flash that to the HMD and then \"Reboot HMD\" in Pitool.\n\nSo far, yes, I tried Large FOV and there is no going back. This thing is amazing, even at only 75 Hz, but it can do 90 Hz no problem with Beta firmware. I played TWD: Saints and Sinners, Compound, The Lab, The Wizards and Assetto Corsa: Competizone.\n\nThe FOV imparts this feeling of presence that nothing else can. It's almost natural feeling. I was playing TWD: Saints and Sinners and there was a point where I ducked under a hole in a fence to circumvent some zombies and when I noticed that I no longer had to physically pan my entire noggin to check if the area was clear, that I had basically done that in an instant via peripheral vision as one would do naturally, I was awe struck as to how important FOV is. FOV is absolutely, 100% underrated.\n\n8KX absolutely destroys Vive Pro 2. It's not even a contest. Best part is that there is next-to-no radial concentric glare \/ god ray problem. It's way way less and the area of clarity is much larger. The best part is that it's comfortable even factory headphone and without KDMAS. I was expecting it to be super heavy but it's not.\n\nAside from the mostly minor issues I'm blown away.\n\nI'm still dialing it in, but so far I've simply upped backlight to 90, Contrast +1 L+R and Brightness -1 L+R, I basically followed NextGenVR's advice here:\n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/OHGNRIq83sA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OHGNRIq83sA)\n\ni7 8700k\n\nRTX 3090\n\nIn ROV tool with 65 IPD I get:\n\n8KX right out of the box with factory facepad= 158 \/ 98\n\nVP2 right out of the box with factory facepad = 94 \/ 74\n\nVP2 with 12mm Kiwi Design facepad (as thin as I can go without experiencing pain \/ discomfort after 20 min and even then my nose still touches \/ bottoms out nose relief area): 112 \/ 90\n\nAnd the 8KX is more comfortable and doesn't run as hot.\n\nThere is basically no comparison here. I regret buying the VP2 before the 8KX. I may sell it, I may keep it, still mulling it over. The 8KX, wow, the FOV, and the increase in vertical FOV to top it off. Blown away. There is no going back to anything after this.\n\n**Updated Summary**\n\nThe more I use the 8KX the more I'm asking myself why I didn't get this sooner and why I even wasted my time and money on the VP2. The VP2 has nothing on this headset.\n\nI can't wait to get my KDMAS, 6m optical cable and silicon protective sleeve.\n\nI'm equally in disbelief with how good this headset is (it's easily the best I've ever owned out of Index, G2 and VP2) with how good and prompt Pimax customer support is. The headset is NOT perfect, there is either dust or a dead pixel in the right display but it's really only present if I go looking for it or if I'm staring at a completely white screen. I don't know if I'm going to ask for an RMA because of it. This headset is amazing even with a dead pixel and the jank, unacceptable original audio strap. It's that good. What really surprised me was the comfort to be honest. When you see pictures of the 8KX you think it's going to be massive and weigh a ton. When you get it in your possession and put it on it's not heavy. I'm sure the KDMAS may add some weight but it will be to the rear. And compared to the VP2 this thing runs WAY cooler. I don't know how they did it (I hear there are heatsinks in the 8KX?) but man, Pimax, you slammed this one out of the park!\n\nLove, love, love this headset\n\n**Updated review:**\n\nI had an exchange with someone a few weeks back comparing the VP2 to the 8KX and, with not a lot of video review material to rely on I revisited VoodooDE's reviews of each headset and something caught my attention. When he visits the spiraling text portion of ROV \/ FOV Tool, what he shows in the VP2 is exactly what I experience. You have a sweetspot that very quickly dissolves into a blurry mess. So I viewed this part of his 8KX review and I was nearly incredulous, like he must be biased or this must be a sponsored review because the area of clarity is so much bigger in the 8KX.\n\nHaving received the 8KX and used it extensively in person I can confirm VoodooDE's through the lens video is accurate, I can confirm that this is an accurate representation of both the non-existent clear area of the VP2 but also the concentric radial blur \/ glare issue:\n\nGo here and pause it at each video and look at the sweet spot between 8KX and VP2:\n\n8KX sweetspot and lens clarity, through the lens: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/sZT6iReBbog?t=1224](https:\/\/youtu.be\/sZT6iReBbog?t=1224)\n\nVP2 sweetspot and lens clarity, through the lens: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Lf3uZ5nGNLE?t=1560](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Lf3uZ5nGNLE?t=1560)\n\n(pause it there and change tabs back and forth to compare)\n\nBasically that's how clear 8KX is and then when you add the FOV:\n\nIn ROV tool with 65 IPD I get:\n\n8KX right out of the box with factory facepad= 158 \/ 98\n\nVP2 right out of the box with factory facepad = 94 \/ 74\n\nVP2 with 12mm Kiwi Design facepad (as thin as I can go without experiencing pain \/ discomfort after 20 min and even then my nose still touches \/ bottoms out nose relief area): 112 \/ 90\n\nLike there is no comparison here. Then you add the fact that 8KX runs considerably cooler than the Vive Pro 2. (With VP2 I cannot play with the windows in my living room closed, even though it's summer where I live it's temperate year round (SF Bay Area) and at night it's usually in the high 50's.

I specifically turned it on in a vain attempt to see if I can ever tame Star Wars Squadrons in VR (this game is notoriously poorly optimized for VR while also being one of the best VR experiences and one of the best games to enjoy at a higher resolution). I swear this game will need a 5090 to finally run at a high resolution at 90fps with setting high\/ultra. My 3090 can't get close unless I'm playing on a blurry Index at low resolutions or something (subtle dig...).\n\nSo I finally thought I'd give Vive motion smoothing a shot and expected the worse..........and.......it's really quite amazing in a certain way. Hear me out.I know it's full of visual artifacts but I think people are really missing on what you gain in return. Without motion smoothing you get the typical hitching\/reprojection where the picture just jitters and looks kind of blurry while you turn in a busy scene. Ok so that's the baseline option 1. \n\nWith Steam VR built in motion smoothing on the Index you lose the jittery movement which now becomes very smooth but you pay for it with an intense blur that is essentially like turning the resolution all the way down during movement or even making the picture sort of cloudy. It's smooth but very ugly (even for the Index.....snicker). \n\nHowever as far as I can tell with the Vive motion smoothing I'm getting little to no jitter and the picture is still super sharp as I'm moving\/turning! This is with a 3090 running Squadrons at high at about 3300x3300 per eye which hits roughly around 18-20ms frame time which is barely around 50hz\/fps. Yet the picture has full resolution sharpness and no jitter or blur\/cloudiness. I lose both negatives from the other solutions. Yes in return I get weird visual artifacts popping up but it's really not that bad....well sort of....yeah it looks like the game is literally glitching up over certain graphical elements. But spending some time flying around I kind of forgot about it and became too busy admiring the razor sharp visuals moving perfectly smoothly. I think it depends on your mindset, like coming from the PS1 era of geometry glitches galore I don't necessarily take this as a deal breaker. The smoothness and sharpness might honestly be worth the tradeoff if you accept it for what it is and don't freak out the moment you see some text glitching about or weird flickering for a split second at the bottom of the screen.\n\nAnyways I have a G2 and I'll probably settle for playing Squadrons on that in 60hz mode but if I didn't have the G2 I think I would honestly just play Squadrons with the motion smoothing turned on and have razor sharp graphics and perfect motion at the expense of the random visual artifacts.\n\nCurious if anyone else has focused on the unique pros of the Vive motion smoothing solution instead of just freaking out at the first instance of a visual artifact. I feel like if Valve were marketing this as a fancy experimental new motion smoothing that retains sharpness and perceived frame rate people would be acting blown away and not be making nearly as big a deal about the visual artifacts.......\n\nBut yeah those artifacts are kind of weird....I just think people are sleeping a bit on the huge pros you get in return that aren't like another motion smoothing technique I've seen.....or maybe I'm just out of my mind. Anyways curious to get other takes from people that have tried it or are willing to give it another go.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170931,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 Motion Smoothing is Being Slept On (Sort of)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o9byid\/vive_pro_2_motion_smoothing_is_being_slept_on\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"what595654","author_created_utc":1395162895,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_fr0ww","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1624760309,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1624805863.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o8o69h","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o8o69h","no_follow":true,"num_comments":42,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o8o69h\/vive_pro_2_help_it_is_super_blurry\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1626773962,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"TLDR: You need a videocard that supports Displayport 1.4 and supports Display Stream Compression (DSC).\n\nI just got a Vive Pro 2, and the render resolution is blurry.

We'll see how that goes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: because of all the \"buy somewhere else\" posts. I live in Poland, so possibilities are severly limited, and costs increased. HTC offer was the best (with the discount code). I don't want to pay full price for this headset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI preordered Vive Pro 2 with a discount code, got my tracking number.\n\nOn the day of delivery I checked the status and it was \"returned to sender\". Shocked, I called the delivery company (UPS) to ask what gives. Turns out the package was not properly addressed, it was missing the building and flat numbers. Also they did not have my phone number so they could not contact me - so they sent it back immediately after it arrived to the destination city. Of course I provided all this data to HTC when ordering.\n\nWhen I contacted HTC it turned out it was \"my fault\" because I put the building and flat number into the second line of the address form (however they did not explain why the shipping company did not get my phone number - there was no way to put the blame on me). The form looked like this - both text fields are editable:Street name:\\[                                       \\]\\[                                       \\]\n\nTurns out that second text field where you can type is an Easter Egg - if you type something there, HTC ignores it, but they don't tell you this. As a result, HTC was happy to just put the street name on the package, without building number, flat number, and without my phone number. Who needs those, right?\n\nNow the best part. My ordered Vive Pro 2 which already was so close to me and yet so far (i.e. in the city where I live) was now gone forever. HTC said they cannot re-send it, it's impossible. Sure, why not, it's HTC after all.They told me to make a new order and even agreed to refund me the amount of the discount code, after I requested it. So I started the ordering process, this time making sure I do not use the second line in the address form. Can you guess the delivery estimate?\n\nEnd of July (funnily enough, during the checkout it still says \"Preorder\")\n\nI asked support if they can expedite because it was 100% their fault I did not get my headset and I got back a standard \"thank you for your patience\" bullshit.\n\nScrew you, HTC and your incompetence.

They would eventually disappear after a few hours, but just be wary.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/W6EJE7Q.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/W6EJE7Q.jpg)\n\n2\/ Face Covers: The one that comes with the Vive Pro 2 is itchy and a sweat magnet. Get a replacement. Either the Kiwi or VR Cover face cover replacements which also come with the back sponge part that cradles the back of the head. If you use the thinnest face cover, here are what to expect:\n\n\\+ Larger FOV+ Less God Rays - sounds strange, but as your eyes are closer to the lenses, the god rays are actually further outside. They don't go away at all, never will with fresnel lenses. You can mitigate this slightly by reducing the brightness to 99%, but already the panel can be a little dimmer than the OG Vive for example.- Heat from the panel will be more noticeable.- Nose flaps might start poking you in the face just below your eyes.\n\n3\/ Turn off Auto Variable Brightness. Give it a test, load into a game or something with a bright sky and dark ground or shadows, try and look at the detail in the shadows. It washes it out and being LCD (although good), you will still notice more grey than black.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nzr7t6\/turn\\_off\\_variable\\_automatic\\_lighting\\_on\\_the\\_vive\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nzr7t6\/turn_off_variable_automatic_lighting_on_the_vive\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4\/ SteamVR and Vive Console software: Both in Steam, search for them, right-click and go to properties then opt into BETA for both of them.\n\n5\/ Fix the Vive Console resolution:\n\nIf you installed it via VivePort...C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\VIVE\\\\Updater\\\\App\\\\ViveVRRuntime\\\\ViveVR\\\\ViveVRServer\\\\config\\\\**default.vrsettings**\n\nIf you installed it via Steam...\n\nC:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\VIVEDriver\\\\App\\\\ViveVRRuntime\\\\ViveVR\\\\ViveVRServer\\\\config\\\\**default.vrsettings**\n\nChange it to false...\n\n\"DisplayResolutionAuto\" : false,\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o0b9lv\/displayresolutionauto\\_anyone\\_else\\_seeing\\_changes\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o0b9lv\/displayresolutionauto_anyone_else_seeing_changes\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat should do. It will take you a few days to look beyond why HTC chose to use their own software, their crap mic, and fresnel god ray inducing lenses. Once you get that behind you, the display panels will hopefully make you keep it. Good luck and give it some time!\n\nEDIT:\n\n6\/ Got this weird issue when the VR headset isn't used for 5 minutes, it goes off, but never wakes up again. So I found a workaround for it.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o5vjn7\/vive\\_pro\\_2\\_goes\\_to\\_sleep\\_doesnt\\_wake\\_up\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o5vjn7\/vive_pro_2_goes_to_sleep_doesnt_wake_up\/)\n\n7\/ Taking calls from your mobile in the Vive Pro 2. If you're on HTC Wireless, have bluetooth enabled in SteamVR settings and the mobile phone. The bluetooth is actually in the Link box, so even on wireless, that needs to be plugged in with power and USB. No display required though, as that part is done via wifi. Both mic and headphones will now work via VP2.\n\n8\/ Chrome extension called Midnight Lizard, which actually helps in VR, weird I know, but here's what I'm on about. I browse in dark mode online, this helps lessen glare\/god rays with big white backgrounds. The flipside of this is white text on black background might produce some glare on text. When the extension is added to Chrome, select Dimmed Dust colour scheme and you will notice the font colour is light grey, not white. You can customise the text\/links to whatever colours = less glare on text.\n\nHere is a screenshot of how to edit it, if you're looking in VR, notice the reduced glare? Give it a go, it's free! [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4nY30W0.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4nY30W0.jpg)\n\nEDIT: Final edit... want VR in multiple rooms? It's a little costly, a little janky, but it does work! [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o6zw80\/wireless\\_and\\_different\\_base\\_stations\\_for\\_multiple\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o6zw80\/wireless_and_different_base_stations_for_multiple\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK 1 more tip to finish off - if you're wanting to adjust the headset on your face, don't hold the front of the HMD. This is what causes the creaking noise, as that whole from part is adjustable and moves. Simply hold the part that hugs your face, no more creaking sounds.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170933,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 - the adjustments\/tweaks list","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o4uj0t\/vive_pro_2_the_adjustmentstweaks_list\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Gus_Smedstad","author_created_utc":1423770781,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_lbl7k","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623866553,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623866812.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o1b52y","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"HTC viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"0a55d404-fed1-11e6-9223-0e2bb0ca3518","link_flair_text":"HTC HMD","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o1b52y","no_follow":false,"num_comments":24,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o1b52y\/my_vive_pro_1_vive_pro_2_early_impressions\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1624509388,"score":13,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I just finished installing and doing some basic testing of my Vive Pro 2. I'm coming from a Vive Pro 1 (and before than an original Vive) using the wireless adapter.\n\nIt's sharper. Much sharper. I've always considered text to be the acid test for VR clarity. In VR Home, which everyone has, the text for game titles when from \"can't read it from across the room\" (original Vive) to \"can read it, but it's visibly blurry\" (Vive Pro 1) to \"razor sharp.\"\n\nSweet spot still matters significantly. If I look at the \"people are currently playing\" wall, the header text for each column (paid games, multiplayer games, free games) is very smeary if my head is pointed at the center of the board. If I tilt my head so my face is pointed directly at the text, the text turns sharp.\n\nThis doesn't detract from ordinary game play as much as you might think. I don't really notice the lack of clarity around the periphery while playing a game, even though I know it's there. It's only if there's text there does it become an issue.\n\nI've never given much thought to the screen door effect, but it's noticeable in its absence. I was always at a bit of a distance from anything I played, aware I was looking at a screen, but now I have much more of a \"looking through a window\" experience. I felt closer to the games I tested - SteamVR home, Pinball FX, and Marble Land. I haven't tried it with something like Fallout 4 VR yet.\n\nAs we all know, objectively, the vertical FOV is narrower than earlier HTC headsets. I was expecting to notice this. I didn't. The experience is still very much a \"wearing a SCUBA mask\" thing, compared to real life, but it doesn't really feel worse than the older headsets. I know I should be able to see a difference, but I think I'd have to switch rapidly between the Pro 1 and the Pro 2 to see it.\n\nIt may be that this is related to the need to look directly at things for clarity. I've been using VR headsets for about 3 years now, and I've developed habits because of the sweet spot.\n\nEDIT: I should mention that I'm running a RTX 2080ti.

(I tried contact lenses with a similar enough presceiption. Will book appointment and start using contacts just for this lol.) Fov increase is huge imo. I measured it: 90 vertical, 112 horizontal, as opposed to 74 vertical and 100 horizontal with regular face pad. It is still fresnel glare and godrays, but I finally discovered why I\u2019ll keep this. Fov and resolution top, but fresnel is just as bad as previous generation. \n\nFinal edit: After comparing OG Vive Pro fresnel with Vive Pro 2 in TestHMD, the glare is identical, but Vive Pro 2 has no chromatic aberration. Sweetspot is very similar, but OG Vive Pro fresnel has a slightly smaller sweet spot vertically. I measured 88 vertical and 94 horizontal on OG Vive Pro, and 72 vertical and 104 horizontal on the Vive Pro (with normal face pad.) Will test with slimmer face pad for video on AltVR.\n\nEDIT: My view on thie Vive Pro 2 changed quite drastically in the few hours since I wrote this. While what stands below the horizontal line represents my first impression and initial post, I now struggle to understand it based on a few back-and-forth sessions in HL:A comparing the VO1 w\/Gear VR Lens mod and the VP2. I really just update live here and try to be as honest as possible, and now my impression has changed. \n\nThe slim facepad to get broader FOV was too uncomfortable for use over longer time. Also, in darker places than the starting scene outside in HL:A where I tried it out, I noticed the smear\/glare more. It was a lot more clear and dark on my VP1 w\/gear lens mod. To keep comfort, I needed the original pad and there is then (but also a little with slim pad), a reduced vertical FOV. \n\nI really must test more, it was so much crisper earlier today. Now I\u2019m feeling more tht it\u2019s not an upgrade and that glare is a problem after all. I really don\u2019t know yet, it\u2019s weird to have these conflicting experiences so close to each other.\n\nSorry for the confusing message, but I\u2019ve really just been writing my experiences here. I\u2019ll keep updating my impressions.\n\nEDIT:  3rd iteration: In dark-ish scenes\/games I prefer VP1 with its OLED and glass lenses mod. In brighter colourful scenes, such as viewing art works in Art Plunge, no SDE and higher resolution makes it more beautiful and diminish the feeling of watching a screen. My impression as it stands now is that this is a high res headset with fresnel lenses with their drawbacks, but I don\u2019t find the fresnel lenses worse than on other devices (though I\u2019ve not tried Index or G2.) The broad horizontal FOV doesn\u2019t give me a lot tbh, it\u2019s being traded for a reduced vertical fov and focusing on the outer horizontal edges I can only do with one eye, while the other will stare into the dark spot between the lenses. I wish they kept the original FOV instead but with the high res screen so that I could mod out the fresnels. Where is our custom glass lens company?!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSo my Vive Pro 2 arrived last night.  I'm going to post an in-depth review at my YouTube channel AltVR ([link](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCECXzl0xf5HH0z7LvUGjFBg) for those who're interested),  but I see so many people returning their Vive Pro 2 or struggling with issues, that I think I'll have to give my preliminary impressions here already in case it can be helpful for people. For clarity: I ran on a 2080 ti and 5900k on water w 32GB 3600mhz cl14 RAM. Settings were 100% in SteamVR with full Vive Pro 2 resolution 90Hz, no reprojection.\n\nGoing into try the Vive Pro 2 the first time, I was quite worried after seeing all the reviews regarding glare and god rays, especially since I would upgrade from my beloved GEAR VR-modded Vive Pro. \n\nAt first I put it on, I immediately understood the \"boxed\" effect but I  had already prepared a thin facepad from the OG Vive that I had lying around. This cleared the issues with vertical FOV which was the most critical, but also increased horizontal FOV, and not least reduced the glare to only the edges. If you want to experience what it's like without having a thin facepad, just press it really hard to your face lol. Be wary if you have glasses.\n\nUnfortunately, I have glasses, so this meant a chance of scratching the lenses. I decided I simply had to do this to be able to test it properly. At this point, I was basically relieved of my fears. There is absolutely no screen door effect, I find the image to be overall without any glare except on the edges of the horizontal FOV. I also managed to ducktape-mount my VROptician lenses from the OG Vive Pro into the Vive Pro 2, and now I'm not afraid of lens scratching either.\n\nHaving given the overall impression, here's some more precise notes so far:\n\n**Colours, Display brightness, and Blacks**\n\nIt's not OLED. The colours are very, very good. The display brightness is not as bright as the OG Vive Pro, but I think it's good enough. This makes the colours feel not as saturated, but I'm very happy here. Perhaps you could even say that the colours in the OG Vive Pro are too saturated lol. I'm not sure. I'll have to go back more and see. The blacks in Half Life: Alyx are definitely more dark gray-ish than OLED. Unfortunately, I've not tried the Index, but I think you can trust others reviews which say that they are a lot better. It's better than on the Quest 2. \n\n**Field of view**\n\nThe vertical field of view is not *much* lower than the OG Vive Pro, what makes it perhaps more noticeable is that it is horizontally straight lines where the blacks are. So if you look up, it's not like looking through binoculars, but you see a dark horizontal cut-off line. I'll get back to this in the theory I describe below and why I might not be as susceptible to care about this point.\n\n**Clarity, sweet spot, glare, god rays, etc.**\n\nLike I said, I was worried going from the Gear VR Glass lens mod back to the fucking nasty fresnels. I'm not worried anymore, I think these work really well. White text on black background will always give some issues on fresnel lenses. But it happens quite seldom, and in bright daylight scenes, I literally do not notice anything in terms of glare or light diffusion unless I try to look at the edge of the lenses (for the Vive Pro 2 this involves looking towards the corner of ones eyes, and I do not do this. This is relevant to the theory coming below. When you don't look towards the edges, it gives a wider FOV in the horizontal periphery, and I really like that. As for clarity, I have never been more impressed with VR resolution and clarity than when I looked at my Gravity Gloves just 30 minutes ago. It looks insanely good. Like, really. Quest 2 resolution impressed me, but it's not being *used.* The lighting effects and details, omg. For me, this is definitely a step up, and I'm glad I'm not having the issues others are describing. \n\n**My theory**\n\nFirst of all, I believe people are struggling due to how shallow or protruding their eyes are, i.e., how close they can get their eyes to the lenses. But here's another theory, take it for what it's worth. Vertical FOV is not an issue for me so far, because I don't look up that far, I adjust by moving my head. This may, however, take time for people to learn. My theory is that this may be because I wear glasses in everyday life, if I look up where the vertical FOV would end in the Vive Pro 2, I'd look straight at my glass frame! Also, if I look to the end of my horizontal vision in real life, I'd look also to my glass frame, or outside of my glasses where it's blurry. I've never thought about this before, simply because I just move my head instead, but in a way I'm living a life with limited FOV lol, where the edges are blurry anyhow. Also, in the Vive Pro 2 and to a lesser extent in real life, if you are looking to the edge of your horizontal field of vision, you are not able to use both eyes to see the same data, because your nose (or in the Vive Pro 2's case, the gap between the lenses), will get in the way of it. So you see only with one of your eyes. I think this affects the extent to which we can actively focus on the periphery and that we'll need new technology to overcome this.  \n\n\nThat being said, I do not think this theory is explaining the \"awful\" god rays and clarity of this HMD. I simply am very happy, I don't think I'll miss my gear vr lenses that bad, and will never go back at the cost of bringing back SDE and a limited horizontal FOV. It's too bad that people experience this differently and we should find a way to compare eye protruding\/shallowness, I'll look into this in my video to start the conversation going with actual measurements in mm, etc.\n\nFor my video, I will do an edit where I use visualizations to show how my actual experience of clarity is in this headset. I'm using a camera to film into the Vive Pro 2 and find that this actually gives me a good representation of what it's like, and I'll be able to show this. \n\n**TL;DR:** With a thin facepad and glasses\/prescription lenses, I'm genuinely very happy. Clarity and colours great, blacks are not OLED (will have to play more to see the effects of this). \n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, questions? What should I cover in the review? Thanks guys for all the other reviews\n\nEDIT: I should add that I\u2019ve noticed some glitch artefacts but that seemed to be because my OC was turned a bit high but need to research this further.\n\nAlso: 120Hz is a really awesome upgrade, but my 2080 ti hates me for it. So much reduced motion blur. But that will be something that I can probably only enjoy in the future, because I am a graphics whore in terms of resolution. Might go performance mode (which still has no SDE) and 120hz if I played a lot of beat saber, etc.\n\n2ND EDIT: I\u2019ll just continue to update this as I go along. Remember, I only got this last night so this is a preliminary review. I\u2019ve gone back to the regular face cushion for now, as the slim one was too heavy on my eyebrow area over longer periods. Noticing more glare now, but still just reminding me of Vive (Pro) Fresnels (as I recall them, but been a long time.) Will move back to Gear VR Vive Pro again to see how much difference there is. I like it better to have the original face pad tight than the slim one.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170121,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 Review: coming from Vive Pro, very positively surprised, keeping it + theory + AMA","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.82,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o11slg\/vive_pro_2_review_coming_from_vive_pro_very\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"gse1","author_created_utc":1503245150,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_88ccm2k","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623774844,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o0ihvk","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"HTC viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"0a55d404-fed1-11e6-9223-0e2bb0ca3518","link_flair_text":"HTC HMD","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o0ihvk","no_follow":false,"num_comments":14,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o0ihvk\/og_vive_to_vp2_from_a_glasses_wearer\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1624507987,"score":37,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I know there are plenty of Vive Pro 2 reviews out there already, but my experience is of someone coming from the original generation of VR tech, having an OG Vive with the Deluxe Audio Strap, but also as someone that has to wear glasses.\n\n**Setup**\n\nThis was pretty straightforward. I plugged in the new link box, cables and headset and downloaded the software as directed from the \"Getting Started\" sheet in the box. I did have an issue where the installation process kept repeatedly raising an error with SteamUI.DLL, which I eventually managed to clear via following various web searches for the problem. I'm not actually sure what I did to finally resolve the problem but finally I managed to successfully finish the installation.\n\nOnce the software was installed, Steam VR worked and detected the new headset straight away (I bought the headset-only package). It flagged up a firmware upgrade for the headset even though the installation software claimed to have already updated it, and then it was all ready.\n\nCurrently I am playing Fallout 4, which I recognise is hardly the best test for a new generation of VR tech, but it's what I'm currently playing so I stuck with it.\n\n**The Very First Thing I Noticed**\n\nThe display resolution is awesome. Not only is the prominent screen door effect from the original Vive completely eliminated, but pixelation from the display resolution was much much finer. These are both things you'd expect, but still, having put the outlay on the VP2, it was gratifying to see.\n\n**The Second Thing I Noticed**\n\nThe audio from the ear speakers is not as good as the Deluxe Audio Strap. The key difference is the bass levels. The speakers still provide a decent generally well rounded audio experience, but the lack of depth in the lower frequencies was immediately noticeable. The more time I spent playing, the less I noticed the problem.\n\n**Display Brightness**\n\nThe display brightness is definitely lower then the OG Vive. Playing Fallout 4 on the VP2 means that night time is now actually like night time. You have to look harder to make out shapes against dark backgrounds and rely on the Pip Boy for light more, whereas on the OG Vive, night-time didn't look much different to day time except with a colour tint over everything and the stars being overhead. I don't actually class this as a negative, it seems that the VP2 handles very dark scenes and very bright scenes more appropriately, rather than just leveling the general brightness to being the same all the time.\n\n**God Rays, Sweet Spot and Prescription Glasses**\n\nBy far the biggest problem I had with the VP2 was awful god rays, especially on text, and there being such a small focus sweet spot that it was hard to keep both eyes in it at the same time. This was my biggest struggle with the VP2 and the biggest downer having spent all that cash.\n\nHowever, with my OG Vive I had some time ago taken to using them without wearing my glasses. I have slight astigmatism and with the OG Vive, the hassle of having my glasses on in the headset, and them tending to get smudged from eyelashes or getting pressed against my skin, I found that they made little enough difference that I just did away with them when playing.\n\nHowever, having struggled so much with the god rays and sweet spot, I decided to try playing again with my glasses. The VP2 has a feature to move the display away from your face, which I only had to do a little to get my glasses on more comfortably then with my OG Vive (move the displays too far forward and it letterboxes your viewing experience). The result was stark, by wearing my glasses, it eliminated the huge majority of the god ray problems and widened the sweet spot massively.\n\nConsidering the marginal difference my glasses made with the OG Vive, I was amazed to see that wearing them was so critical with the VP2. It leads me to wonder whether a lot of folks complaining about these issues with the VP2 may actually have undiagnosed visual problems that they normally compensate for, but that comes out when trying to use the VP2.\n\n**Overall**\n\nOverall I have no regrets buying the VP2. Sure, I'm coming from 2 generations back of VR technology, and also it helps that I have a 2080 Super that powers the headset nicely on the second-highest \"Ultra\" setting. But, with the number of people apparently keen to cast aspersions on the VP2, and particularly my experience with the god rays and sweet spot, I thought it might be a useful piece to read for other folks either moving from an OG Vive and\/or considering the VP2.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170121,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"OG Vive to VP2 from a Glasses Wearer","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.83,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o0ihvk\/og_vive_to_vp2_from_a_glasses_wearer\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"crossplane","author_created_utc":1320760059,"author_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","author_flair_css_class":"default button","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"c47aa7a8-5df9-11e5-b21d-12f8a41ffdcb","author_flair_text":"VP2 \/ G2","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_67dna","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623753430,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623759863.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o0b9lv","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o0b9lv","no_follow":false,"num_comments":42,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o0b9lv\/displayresolutionauto_anyone_else_seeing_changes\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1624507643,"score":40,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Edit: this is regarding the vive pro 2 and automatic resolution settings. \n\nI was looking in this thread for turning off variable automatic brightness, which I did and this does work.\n\n[Turn off Variable Automatic Lighting on the Vive Pro 2 : Vive (reddit.com)](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nzr7t6\/turn_off_variable_automatic_lighting_on_the_vive\/)\n\nIn this thread it refers to the following default.vrsettings file where I also disabled the IPD Overlay successfully.

Owned the OG Vive, Odyssey +, Rift S, and Reverb G2. I've had the G2 since November, and the Vive Pro 2 for about a week. Past couple days I have been doing some more A\/B comparisons. \n\nMy specs:\ni7 9700F\nRTX 3080 OC\n16 GB DDR4\n\n**Overall Picture:** Let's start with this, since it seems to be the most hotly contested issue. For me, the Vive Pro 2 wins, no contest. The colors are just so vibrant, contrast is incredible, blacks are very good for an LCD. It is true that the G2 edges out an objective win in sharpness BUT mainly when looking at text\/menus in the distance (for me). For objects up close, or honestly anything other than text, I can perceive little to no difference in sharpness. The Pro 2 delivers an incredibly crisp image. I can't stress this enough - the colors and contrast are just so much better on the VP2. The G2 looks washed out to me in direct comparison (and that's saying something, the colors on the G2 are pretty darn good). This is just a different ballgame in terms of immersion. In \"Compound,\" the colors POP on the VP2. In \"The Blue,\" the deep blacks and contrast bring things to life. In Half Life Alyx, I noticed colors I hadn't noticed before on buildings and elsewhere due to the fantastic picture. Color and contrast simply cannot be understated here. \n\n**Glare**- yes, there is significant glare with the VP2. With the G2, glare is slim to none. But as many others have said, 95% of the time I really don't notice this in game - it's largely relegated to high contrast scenes and menus. However, if glare is something that bothers you, I'm afraid it is definitely present on the VP2. G2 wins here, no question.\n\n**FOV**: I am using a Kiwi 12mm pleather replacement face pad on the VP2. I haven't measured it, but the FOV is substantially bigger on the VP2. Vertical feels about the same, but the horizontal increase feels huge compared to the G2, and the immersion is much improved because of it. Going back to the G2, this was one of the main things I missed. In games such as \"Windlands\u201d or \"Ultrawings,\" you just don't get the same sense of movement from the G2 due to its restrictive FOV. \n\n**Screendoor:** I can fairly easily detect it on the G2. On the VP2, it is basically gone. \n\n**Edge to Edge Clarity\/Sweet Spot:** This seems roughly the same to me in both headsets. The G2 might have a slightly bigger sweet spot. However, Due to the VP2's superior FOV, I perceive the edge to edge clarity as better once in the sweet spot. \n\n**Comfort:** This one took me a couple days to figure out. But now that I have it dialed in on the VP2, I'd say it is about the same if not a tad inferior to the G2. The G2 is extremely light, and I believe that gives it an advantage here. But to the VP2's credit, the weight is distributed very well. I can use it for hours without issue, same as the G2. The VP2 does tend to get a little hotter, however. \n\n**Audio:** This surprised me. I would say the audio on the G2 is objectively better. HOWEVER.. Not by an insane margin. The audio on the VP2 is perfectly adequate for me. I did notice when going back to the G2 that I felt less immersed by the audio solution, as I could still easily hear my surroundings. This took me out of the game. The on-ear solution on the VP2 blocks out quite a bit of sound, which for me increases immersion substantially. Also, you get more highs simply due to the proximity of the speakers to your ears. I actually prefer it now, to be honest. \n\n**Performance:** I get better performance on Ultra and 150% SS with the VP2 than I do with the G2 on 100% SS. Although I haven't measured, it is a very noticeable improvement in games, and less buggy going in and out of SteamVR home.\n\n**Tracking:** I told myself that if the VP2 didn't work out, I would get rid of my base stations, index controllers, and go back to WMR tracking. MixedVR is just a buggy mess. Now that I've gotten a taste of what it feels like to go back to the superior native lighthouse ecosystem, the G2 inside-out tracking just does not hold up in the slightest. I forgot how frequent of an annoyance the G2's inside-out tracking is. \n\n**Conclusion:** To me, there really is no comparison when talking about immersion. The Vive Pro 2 wins, hands down. It has the superior colors, contrast, and FOV, all while trading punches with the G2's sharpness. The comfort is fine once dialed in, and the on-ear headphones (while maybe not as high quality as the G2) do a better job of removing ambient noise. If you have the cash to blow and the rig to handle it, I highly recommend this headset.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170122,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 Vs.

This gave me amazing FOV, and edge to edge clarity.\n\nWith the vp2, besides the fact that there's no place to put magnets or something of that sort - the headset has a rotation lock on the strap. You cannot put it past parallel to the lenses. This is a huge issue, as for me if I have it cradling the back of my head as it's supposed to, then the lenses won't angle down, all the pressure is on my forehead and none on my cheeks. On every other headset you can angle the lenses down, but not this one.  If I try to obtain the right angle, I have to have the back strap practically on top of my head, then the headphones won't even reach my ears and it's really not that comfortable.\n\nI have found a semi-solution, where if you loosen the headstrap screws almost completely off, you can get it to slip past the stop point and go beyond.  But if you over extend it, it pulls on the cables leading to the headphones. But it extends enough that I can have it properly fitting on my head. This greatly improved comfort, but the problem stems further due to the lens relief. Even with a 6mm gasket, the whole front assembly comes towards you, whereas on the index it's just the lenses.  I can't get them to come close enough, and as it gets close, my nose ends up hitting the plastic on the headset, as well as the flaps for the light bleed being super aggressively pushed into my nose.  This is the closest I've gotten to \"optimal\" clarity, but it's really uncomfortable especially compared to the index which is like a familiar pillow on my head.  Also edge to edge clarity is still awful and the sweet spot extremely small at this distance.\n\nI'll sacrifice some uncomfortably close pictures of my face to demonstrate what I mean.\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zMPz39A.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/zMPz39A.jpg)\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Rb8xFBk.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Rb8xFBk.jpg)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"If you've got a pronounced brow ridge and small cheek bones, the vive pro 2 will not work for you","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nyjj0r\/if_youve_got_a_pronounced_brow_ridge_and_small\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"GPSILVER47","author_created_utc":1572713456,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"new","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"4f9d5e8a-6c37-11e9-b35f-122677b24742","author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_4xixfzn8","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623497334,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623499824.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"ny4ofk","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"ex viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"ee8b1e72-69a9-11e5-bb28-0e53d95baa8f","link_flair_text":"VR Experiences","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_ny4ofk","no_follow":false,"num_comments":26,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/ny4ofk\/vive_pro_2_is_going_back_my_review\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623548230,"score":20,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hello guys. It\u2019s a long post, but maybe you have similar issues &amp; could help maybe, which i don\u2019t think with this headset. \n\nHardware Specs: i9-10850K, RTX 2080 Ti, 32GB RAM\n\nSo i am a OG Vive owner. \u201eWas\u201c, because i sold mine over 4 weeks ago. I wanted to upgrade and bought the pro 2. It came like 5 days ago. For me it was pretty ok to wear the headset. It\u2019s good balanced. You can put it on &amp; off very quickly. With OG Vive i only head the standard straps. The resolution &amp; hz are fantastic on this headset. I couldn\u2019t see any pixel. That\u2019s it for the positive side. \n\nNow the bad things. The first time i could use it only 15 minutes. Yesterday i took my time &amp; took the headset out of my sideboard and put it on my table for 6-10 minutes (unplugged). Started VRChat, headset &amp; lets go. Right away there was like a very grey foggy oval long circle on the right lens. I\u2019ve moved the headset around too check if it was my eye, but it wasn\u2019t. The room was not hot, so wtf? After 30 minutes it began to shrink. The blacks are so washed out. I know i come from the og vive with OLED, but thats extreme. Brightness is too low. \n\nThe glow and glares around white text or other things are extreme. Which makes everything worse!! While standing still &amp; moving with the index controller in different games, there were so much connection\/pixel glitches. FOV is kinda cropped from the bottom &amp; too, but after some time you\u2019ll get used too it. \n\nTHE MIC SUCKS! SOUNDS LIKE A \ud83e\udd54 \ud83d\ude2d\n\nEarphones are always making a noise. Drivers\/software everything is clean &amp; updated. Having problems with the index controller now for some reasons. Do you guys have the same issues? The headset is going back!

I simply like to read what others are seeing that I'm missing or the bad things that have been happening.  Either way, I'm enjoying all the dialogue you guys have going right now.  \n\nI have experience with several different headsets.  I started out with the OG Vive, added wireless, then moved up to Vive Pro with wireless.  After that, I bought and tested a Vive Cosmos, Valve Index, reverb G2 and quest 2.  My company does landscape design and build and we use VR as part of our process (I know, it sucks to be me).  This is why I've checked into so many different headsets.  Anyway, the point is that I have some experience with VR.  \n\nMy office setup is a Ryzen 7 5800x, 32GB RAM and an RTX 3090.  I have approx 600sqft of open space for VR, which is one more reason to love wireless.  \n\nWhile they all have their good and bad, the overall most important factor for me, whether gaming or work, is the freedom of wireless.  On that front alone, the Index and Reverb, although awesome, were disqualified.  I tried the quest 2 as it was needed for a new software we were using.  I still have it as it's now part of our process.  I am not a Facebook fan, but I'm not holding that against the actual headset and experience.  I've found the headset is pretty damned decent, especially at its price point.  But that's all it is to me, it's decent.  Tracking sucks compared to Vive with lighthouse 2.0.  The picture is not as clear as VP but the screen door effect is similar, which is pretty minimal.  Overall, the Quest 2 is only kept because of the software we use it for.  That software will not work with Vive.  Vive Pro wireless is vastly better.  It's not that it's vastly better in one metric, it's that it is better in many metrics, making it much better overall.  If I had to simplify it, the quest 2 simply isn't as immersive as the VP.\n\nOn to the Pro 2.  When I first set it up, I installed the wireless adapter before checking any instructions.  After about 30 seconds to a minute, it would crash.  I restarted the computer a few times.  Then I wondered to myself, \"hmmmmm.  that cosmos uses a higher wattage batter, I wonder if this thing needs that.\"  Changed battery, and voila, no more crashes...  So, I spent some time looking around at our VR designs, google earth, HL Alyx, Nvidia Fun House.  It looked a lot better, but not better enough for me to be jumping with excitement.  Screen door effect was imperceptible, I had to really TRY to find the SDE.  God rays seemed to be awful.  Reading white text on black background was really difficult.  I really noticed the larger FOV and that alone makes a much more immersive experience.  \n\nAfter my initial testing and thoughts, I dove into the settings, read up on others' experiences and have spent a little more time with it.  I learned that wireless was not putting out even close to full resolution, yet it still was better than the VP, which I chalk up to the SDE being all but gone.  I've connected it with the cable so I could run it at full resolution, 120hz.  This does make an even bigger difference for sure.  Google earth in street view is wicked.  It was surreal with VP, but this is another level of immersion.  In our designs, I can zoom in on items such as a chair or a plant and it just looks better and better the closer I get.  \n\nOverall, I'm happy with this headset and I will be selling some equipment!  I look very much forward to the update allowing higher resolution with wireless.

It's just more evenly distributed. \n\nThe resolution and clarity is improved, as you'd expect. But the difference isn't as transformative as I'd hoped. Sure I can see a pronounced difference, but that just doesn't impact the experience as much as I'd hoped. \n\nAlso that difference only really comes to bare in the more simple titles that allow you to fully up your render scale. \nTitles where it would be super useful, such as PCars 2, need such a drop to scale, you're only a touch sharper than the Index, for example. \n\nThe FOV is obviously reduced, but much like the resolution, this didn't really effect my experience. I noticed it, until I didn't. If you focus on it, you'll feel you're looking through a scuba mask. But that never bothered me, even coming from the far higher fov of the index. \n\n\n\nNow the bad. You could pick any one of these as a reason to rerun the VP2, but altogether, it became a complete no brainer not to hold on to it:\n\nThe biggest deal breaker for me, is the Vive Console software in-between. It's janky and causes me no end of issues. Weirdly it seems to DRASTICALLY increase launch times of pretty much every title I play. It causes crashes when exiting steamvr quite bit for me too. \nMost of all, the render scale in steamvr changes on each boot, seemingly at random. You dial in a render scale that works, just to have it mean something else next time you play. 150% sometimes means 3400x3400, sometimes it means 2760x2760. That can have a huge impact on performance and I got bored fiddling with it. \n\nBrightness: yes the VP2 has deeper blacks than the Index. But because it works much like a cheap HDR display. It just dims the whole thing in dark scenes. Elite Dangerous felt like I was playing with sunglasses on. Space looked pleasingly black, but the ship and HUD elements were dimmed to achieve that. Just made the whole thing look muddy and dark. \n\nFogging. It's summer. It's hot. Mostly notable in dark scenes as the screen dims, but my lenses would almost instantly fog up when it's hot. I didn't notice until playing the dark areas of Alyx, or Elite. Suddenly black becomes a hazy grey until you wipe the lenses. Rinse and repeat. \n\nAudio. I don't mind the on ear headphones as some do. That's a preference thing. I do HATE the background static\/hum from them though. Nothing I can do has removed it. Not even Nvidia broadcast can filter it. So it's obviously there at a hardware level. \n\nPerformance. Obviously it's a greedy boy. I have a 3090 and there's not a huge amount I wish to play, where I can really stretch the legs on 12mp worth of display. Yes you can run sub native to claw back performance, but being a high Res display doesn't save it from the exact same issue that stops you doing that on a monitor. Once you're sub native the image becomes soft. Soft enough there's no longer any point in having such a sharp display. So it's often a case of aiming for 120hz, and settling for 60fps reprojected. No thank you. \n\nGlare. Unbearable. Even sitting on the menu screens of beat saber, every white element has a small dancing halo around it that moves as you do. The optics are truly woeful. No face pad I have, from 6mm to 18mm could get away from it. Lights in Alyx? Halo. Reading text? Halo. It's truly truly awful.

I am not (my rig : RTX 3090, i9-9900K, 32Gb DDR4 RAM @ 3600Mhz).\n\nBasically, I use the Rally's SIRVAAG 2021 modlist (no ENB).\n\nI deactivated heavy mods (majestic mountains for instance), came back to 2D Tree LODs and initial settings in ini files but I still run at a 12\/15 ms framerate meaning constant reprojection. Even Shizof's \"FPS stabilizer mod\" does not help ! It's a real nightmare and it makes me sick when playing due to constant stuttering.\n\nIn Steam VR, I reduced the SS from 150% (4064x4064) to 100% (3320x3320) but it is the same. Below, it begins to blur and results are not significantely better.\n\nOf course, everything is ok in interiors. My tests were restricted to the region between Helgen and Riverwood.\n\nAny idea to improve that ?\n\n***EDIT: First Update***\n\n*Some workarounds before we can buy a RTX 9090 ;)*\n\n1 ) first using the approach of *John2910 (thanks again John)*. Use the vive console on automatic graphics and reduce the Steam SS around 70%. You obtain a framerate in exteriors below 11 ms (with a RTX 3090 !!) with occasional reprojection depending on the area.\n\n2 ) *OR:* set the vive console on \"Performance Mode (120 Hz)\" and Steam SS on automatic.\n\nIn that case, you have constant reprojection but, surprisingly (or me at least), movements remain smooth.\n\nDrawback : picture is slightly blurred in each case. It's much sharper with my VP1 !\n\n***EDIT: Second Update***\n\nJust tested the game in the extreme mode (120Hz) of the vive console. And letting the Steam Supersampling on Auto. You could think it is insane but surprisingly, the game is quite playable !\n\nOf course, you get constant reprojection but surprisingly, no stuttering when you move your head. Butter smooth ! And you have maximum clarity this time. And most of all, this is the first time I see Skyrim with no aliasing in the background (trees).\n\nDrawbacks: objects\/characters are slightly blurred when you walk with your controllers. The same in menus when you move your head. If you are static, text is crystal clear.\n\n***EDIT: Third Update***\n\nGood news for Skyrim fans. I confirm you can play Skyrim with a recent graphic card (not necessarily a RTX 3090 I think). I reinstalled my heavy mods, high settings in Dyndolod, 3D trees...\n\nAnd yes, with a RTX 3090, I can still play with this heavy modded game, badly optimized, in the extreme mod (Steam SS: auto). So I think there is a good margin for a RTX 3070 or 3080. Actually, FPSVR indicates 60FPS instead of 120FPS. Since reprojection is constant, it is not surprising. This morning, I walked around Riverwood and visited the Bleak falls barrow.\n\nI still compare the VP2 to my VP1.\n\nAdvantages: this is a massive improvement in exteriors. That is really impressive. Skyrim is now really beautiful in VR. I took some time to admire the surroundings of Riverwood. \"Majestic Mountains\" are so impressive with the VP2. This is hard to describe. The large FOV (compared to VP1 again) is really an advantage. In that part of the game, I did not notice annoying god rays. In menus, if you do not move the head, texts are very clear.\n\nDrawbacks: the major one for me is the black level. It is ok in shops or inns if you light the scene (I am using \"quick light\"). But in some parts of Bleaks falls barrow, the VP1 is much better. That's simple: in dark areas, if there is no light source, it is hard to distinguish ennemies. Blacks are really crushed and the constrast very poor. Please note that I did not install any ENB. Maybe it could improve the contrast.\n\nSo far, I still do not know if I keep this headset or not. Not sure to get used to these LCD panels.\n\n***EDIT: Fourth (final ?) Update***\n\nI installed the hifiENB for Onyx VR (LCD version of course). What a game changer ! Of course, blacks are still crushed but contrast in dark areas has vastly improved. That's a must have if you use a LCD headset. A minor drawback is that dungeons are brighter now (maybe I can change my lighting mods). Globally, the experience is very satisfying now and I think I will keep my VP2.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 and Skyrim: unplayable on a RTX3090","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nwwmus\/vive_pro_2_and_skyrim_unplayable_on_a_rtx3090\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"theHygienist","author_created_utc":1366402610,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_bdqx0","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623336811,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nwpkvh","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nwpkvh","no_follow":false,"num_comments":3,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nwpkvh\/positive_vp2_review_index_to_vp2\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623545479,"score":29,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I recently RMA\u2019d my 1.5 yo Index due to lens scratch and particulate between lens and screen (never use canned air to clean our hmd gasket, folks). I pre-ordered VP2 just in case delay or unsatisfactory outcome -but then Valve just up and sent me new HMD! Coincidentally, both replacement and VP2 on same day, same truck. Valve customer service is legend!!!\n\nAnyway I tested new Index and I was surprised to find a few improvements that I believe are not subjective\u2014 color saturation\/ contrast appear much better on replacement , ipd adjustment is now super smooth, low frequency click on right ear speaker is eliminated. \n\nVP2 Impressions after 1 day:\n2080 ti, 9900k, 16\/4000 MHz ram.\n\nFOV: I immediately switched out face pad to thin Kiwi brand. Vertical FOV reaches just before periphery where index exceeds just beyond it. Hfov goes to vp2 however at 1st vp2 feels flat in front of you where index wraps around more naturally ( think large flat-pane scuba mask vs rounded globe space suit helmet).  This may be due to difference in left right overlap? \u2014\u2014\u2014My brain adjusted to this difference after a few hours though and it looks \/feels normal now, so much so that I almost didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nGlare\/ God rays: Menus and title screens are horrible, significantly worse than index \u2014 I was so disappointed when browsing games in Steamvr room. Terrible smears, extended rays, concentric rings that distorted depth perception so I was looking through a bubble. I was ready to ditch it. But then, once in game (after title\/menus) it all disappears and it is incredibly sharp, clear and with great color\/contrast. H3vr I was watching splinters fly from the farthest wooden hotdog targets in casual outdoor range. Dark AZ nighttime range was just as glare free. This proved true in all games I sampled\u2014 dark scenes in Alyx, Pavlov fine, bright text on dark background horrible but really just menus\/title screens.\n\nGames: Vp2 absolutely transformed No limits 2 roller coaster sim -greatly improving clarity in distance and reducing shimmering artifacts. Basically it has been a joy revisiting several games that I had been somewhat turned off by due to fidelity issues. \nI find the sweet spot to be easy enough to find and sustain\u2014edge to edge clarity is great and comparable to index. I don\u2019t know why some note the Vp2 to have compromised screen brightness for black levels -it feels just right to me albeit at 100% and no room to go higher. \nOn the other hand I still much prefer the index for rhythm games such as pistol whip, beat saber , audio trip and ragnorock. This is mostly due to vastly superior index audio, off ear speakers for comfort\/ air circulation , and higher more stable frame rates on my 2080 ti system.\n\nI don\u2019t think the leap in visual fidelity is quite worth the asking price ESPECIALLY with absolutely inferior audio -both headphones and mic as well as sub-par glare mitigation (mostly limited to menus\/title load screens tho). This should be $500 not $800. \nOverall I would still recommend Index over Vp2 for general use -especially for beginners and those interested in rhythm\/music\/sweat inducing games. Easier to put on head, easier to adjust software settings w\/o needing restart, higher more stable frames on sub nasa level rigs such as mine- also I can attest that valve customer service is fantastic once past their boilerplate rma request process.\n\nVP2 is somewhat half baked but really shines when you take the time correcting things: Mic windscreen, thin face pad, headphone replacement. I really do appreciate the noticeably increased fov , colors, blacks,and resolution. TheBlu whale  encounter experience is absolutely must see on VP2! Likewise I am confused and frustrated HTC actually saw the lens glare as passable at this asking price -but alas it all but goes away for me in game.\nSo I\u2019ll keep and use both until Index2 arrives on the scene:) Can\u2019t wait to remove headphones and get my hd650\u2019s on this bitch.

First off it feels much cheaper than the index, plastic is creaky, it's pretty light, feel of the plastic is meh, but that's not too important.\n\nFirst impressions putting it on, with stock foam, is how it's almost entirely blurry and no matter how tight I ratchet it down it has a horrible FOV, sweet spot, and glare.  I kind of expected this and I have a  6,10,14mm face gasket ready to go.  I throw on the 6 and there's large gaps on the sides of my face, the vive pro definitely seems to fit wider faces better than the index as my index I had to mod the facial interface to make it wider, and with this it's got more than enough room.  The FOV and clarity definitely improves though. But I hate PU leather on my face, and I dislike the foam, the anti microbial fabric on the index is definitely where it's at.\n\nI throw on the 10mm and this seems to be the sweet spot.  But I am struggling wholeheartedly with finding the right fitment.  To be in the sweet spot, I have to have the lenses higher up on my forehead than I expect, cropping the bottom of the FOV.  My biggest gripe right here, is I can't ANGLE THE LENSES DOWN.  They are stuck at parallel to the back strap, so the further I pull the back down, the more the lenses are angled up.  This is a HUGE issue if you have a large brow ridge, with small cheek bones like me.  Index got this absolutely right.  Picture it being extremely tight on my forehead and almost no weight on my cheeks, far away from my eyes.  My eyebrows are touching the lenses leaving smears but they're still far away from my actual eyes.\n\nI have a neanderthal-esque brow ridge, while my cheek bones are flat. So therefore putting my finger across them I can feel my eye on my finger, it's shallow in that sense, but I could only achieve proper FOV and clarity on the index with the Magnet mod, which is stacking magnets on the top facial interface posts to angle the lenses down to allow them to get closer to my eyes.\n\nSo I don't see any good way to do this with the vive pro.  If I try to get the right angle onto my face, I have to have the back strap practically on top of my head, not very secure, and then the earphones barely\/don't even reach my ears at max length.  I know for a fact I'm not finding the maximum clarity.\n\nIf I just ignore the strap and hold the headset to my face in the perfect position, the FOV is fine, I don't notice the vertical much, the horizontal while bigger than the index \"feels\" pretty well the same. It's essentially on par with the index just a different aspect ratio.  The glare is probably the same as the index, while the god rays are actually worse, there are noticeable rays of light beaming out from text even in a bright environment as I move my head around. This greatly affects percieved clarity. Sweet spot is slightly worse than index. Edge to edge clarity in the most optimal position is about the same as index.\n\nWith the god rays\/glare, even in MY most optimal position, the resolution only appears slightly better than the index. The screen door is gone, but actual clarity seems damn near the same - I'm not seeing what I paid $1100 CAD for when it comes to this.  Text is clearer but it's not a game changer considering the other optical issues.\n\nAnd the headphones are worse feeling than I expected. They're fine, but I have grown to LOVE off ear headphones like the index, and these make me feel hot and uncomfortable in comparison. Treble and mids are more fleshed out, I can hear some things better, but the index has way more sound stage and bass. These are fine overall I suppose.\n\nOverall I am very close to just packaging this thing up and sending it back. It's worse in almost every way FOR ME than the index. I am going to fiddle with it for the next week or so and see if I can dial it in first.  If anyone has any advice for a magnet mod type thing for this headset, or somehow getting the lenses to angle down I'd happily take it.\n\nEdit: a couple more points, it goes without saying that the comfort with it fitting on my head like this is far from good. It feels like I have an awkward brick on my head, but the balance is good, better than the index. I dislike the giant foam padding at the back but perhaps if I could actually have it cradle the bottom of my skull like its intended to, it would hold in place better. The lens relief is actually finnicky as well, if I pull on it it clicks it out a few notches, where on the index it's solid as could be.  I dislike the ipd adjustment as well - but it works well enough.\n\nSTEREO OVERLAP\nthis is something I didn't understand until I saw it for myself. Apparently the vp2 has worse stereo overlap then all other headsets before it by quite a bit. I didn't know what to expect, but now I see it. If I am looking left or right, it feels like only partial of my vision is in 3d, and the other eye is looking at \"my nose\". It's blocked off, and it's like there's something in the way.  My depth perception on snipers in pop one is off.  It's not the worst thing ever, but it is a piss off and throws me off.\n\nThis thing feels hot. It's probably not hotter than the index, but the lack of ventilation (especially with my magnets on the index) with the nose flaps and the pu leather it's like having a rubber gasket around my eyes with 0 air flow.\n\nAnd the software finally has already had some crashes for me.  Sometimes if I turn on my index controllers the whole screen freezes for a second then they pop up.  Sometimes a game starts and it gives some odd error. Plus the friction with the resolution and having to restart steamvr to change refresh rates ect is just downright worse than the index.\n\nTl;dr if you needed a magnet mod on the index you'll most likely have a horrible time with this hmd.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169852,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First impressions from longtime vr user and index owner","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nwp9on\/first_impressions_from_longtime_vr_user_and_index\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"HauntingOwl2810","author_created_utc":1603174318,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"ascended","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"b86b93fa-6c37-11e9-8866-12b853345bae","author_flair_text":"","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_4r2va79x","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623267391,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nw4btz","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nw4btz","no_follow":false,"num_comments":62,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nw4btz\/from_quest_2_to_vive_pro_2_and_quickly_back_again\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623544312,"score":10,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Finally got my Vive Pro 2 this afternoon.

Like many of you I pre-ordered very early on directly from HTC to take advantage of the $50 discount and when the 3rd of June rolled around I was expecting a \"your order has shipped\" email, midway through the day I contacted HTC customer support to inquire about the status of the order and was told that they didn't know when it would ship. Someone on here reported that their 11 May pre-order (which predated my pre-order by two days) had an ETA of June 15. At that same point in time someone on here suggested that B&amp;H had VP2 in stock and with customer service chat still open I cancelled my pre-order and ordered from them with standard shipping (free). To my delight it arrived yesterday. \n\nThe day before yesterday, in anticipation for the new headset, I installed a 3rd Valve Lighthouse 2.0 as I have a blind area near my kitchen (roughly 3x4 meter play area going by SteamVR but it's larger in actuality) and I'm glad I did so as it made the return to a proper SteamVR HMD that much more glorious. \n\n**Backstory** \n\nI picked up an Index early last year and sold it after \"upgrading\" to the Reverb G2, while retaining the Lighthouses and Knuckles controllers. I have had nothing but problems with the Reverb G2. I don't know where the problems ultimately originate from, but WMR is seriously Games for Windows Live level garbage-ware. Before picking up a PCI-E USB card my G2 would lock up my PC 80% of the time, necessitating a hard reboot, and 5-6 of WMR and \/or the G2 locking up my PC would result in Windows needing to be repaired. This happened not once, not twice, but three times. Luckily I always keep a system image on hand for stuff like this but yeah. Also, WMR would \"forget\" WMR Boundary, meaning, I had to spend 10 minutes walking around my room 2-3 times as the first time would never result in an accurate representation of my play area. Redoing Boundary means redoing the Knuckles controller calibration via SpaceCal, at one point I was doing this on a weekly basis. And the Knuckles controllers would never track properly, there would be some kind of weird drift where if you stood in one place and did a 360 the controllers would perceptibly move a few inches and this would get progressively worse during any play session where eventually your virtual hands in game would be 6 inches below or above or to the side of your controllers. \n\nThere was also some kind of camera tracking induced jitter while walking around, either moving around in a virtual playspace, or using Natural Locomotion for movement (I love playing HL:A with NaLo + Vive trackers on ankle bracelets). Eventually I learned to walk softly as this is immersion destroying. \n\nThe G2 speaker arms constantly needed to have their screws tightened otherwise just head movement would cut the sound to one or the other speakers and there is an established problem with the G2 where speaker volume above 85% would cause the displays to go black with explosions (100% reproducible in The Lab &gt; Fort Defense when shooting an explosive barrel). \n\nThe G2 did have acceptable FOV after swapping the default face gasket for an 18mm pad, and I had a 98 HFOV and 90 VFOV up from 89 and 85 with the factory face-plate. \n\nI had numerous other issues, including a problem while playing Assetto Corsa Competizione where the worldview would slowly flip upside down followed by both screens turning blue. This happened on avg. once every hour or so, and if you were in a multiplayer race it was game over. \n\nI had so many frustrating moments with this headset, so many profanity filled evenings where I'm sure I alarmed my neighbors. It was truly the biggest piece of shit hardware I've ever owned in my entire life and I will never buy another HP product nor WMR headset. \n\nSo I was READY to upgrade to ANYTHING and had put considerable research in Pimax's 8KX as a potential alternative but decided against that as for one, I have a large nose and people with large noses have issues with Pimax HMD's, Pimax 8KX is a lot of pixels to drive and still retain G2 level of clarity, even for someone with a water-cooled RTX 3090, and there were concerns about comfort, audio, and Pimax customer support. \n\nExpectations: So I waited and out of the blue HTC announced the Vive Pro 2. At first I was excited, especially after reading and watching Sebastian Ang's review. So I pulled the trigger very early on. Then, within the past few weeks, it was one mixed or outright negative review after another, starting with VoodooDE's review, and followed up with a plethora of negative reviews here. At one point I seriously considered returning my order but part of me just wanted to satisfy my curiosity and BOY AM I GLAD I DID. \n\n**First Impressions**\n\nMy first impression of the VP2 was how well it is put together coming from the G2. The cable attachment and management is elegant and functional. The padding on the rear is robust and comfortable. The headphones are sturdy and produce a satisfying click as you adjust them about their hinges. Right out of the box I had a Kiwi HTC Vive Pro face-pad on it as I wanted to really maximize the FOV wow factor coming from the G2. Many have stated that it's like going from 4:3 to 16:9 and I would actually go so far as to say it's like going from 4:3 to near 21:9. The clarity to my eyes feels the same as the G2 except there is fairly moderate glare from anything that is white on the screen which does hamper the clarity slightly. The sweetspot feels slightly smaller than the G2 but still good. The heat is about the same as the G2. \n\nBut I am not doing this review any justice, I need to attempt to put into words the feeling of firing up SteamVR Home for the first time @ 120 Hz with the FOV increase and perfect lighthouse tracking without needing to calibrate the controllers. It was absolutely otherwordly coming from the G2. Also, the colors, blacks and contrast, my god THE BLACKS, I can't believe this is LCD! Last night I was playing TWD: Saints and Sinners and I had this feeling of presence that induced a certain feeling of dread that I just didn't have in the G2 @ 90 Hz and 4:3 FOV with mediocre blacks and contrast. There was a lit torch outside of a bus that I stopped and admired as it felt like I was looking at an HDR panel in terms of contrast. \n\n**Audio** \n\nGoing by the reviews and complaints here I was ready for really bad audio. To my PLEASANT surprise the audio is not only acceptable (I find it to be on par with Index only lacking in mids and bass, but the treble is better than G2 \/ Index nearfield speakers) but as pointed out here by another reviewer, YOU HAVE ISOLATION FROM LIGHTHOUSE WHINE. I didn't realize how important this is until using these headphones. The lighthouses emit an incredibly annoying high pitched whine that you absolutely can hear with both the G2 and Index. Not so in the VP2. For this reason I am actually going to say that the audio sounded BETTER than the off-ear offerings of the G2 and Index. Combined with the 100% total complete light blocking (with the G2 a face-pad velcroed to the HMD has many light-leak sources, although the nose-peak can be considered a tradeoff). Also, the volume button is a god-send. I found the VP2 to be VERY loud at only 80% volume and having the ability to turn the volume up or down depending on the title or situation without having to use SteamVR UI is really really nice, extremely underrated. I am going to actually go against the trend here and say that the audio solution is an improvement over the G2 and Index. With the VP2 you have excellent light insulation and the sound isolation really takes that to the next level, and drowning out basestation whine, I can't place enough emphasis on how amazing this is. \n\n**Comfort** \n\nVersus G2: \n\nI hope I don't sound biased at this point, but even being heavier the VP2 trades blows with the Reverb G2 from a comfort stand-point. For one, the HMD fits much better on the face, I don't know how to put it, I don't know if it's the arc of the HMD itself but I find the point where the HMD meets my face to feel better with the VP2. The VP2 is also balanced, it does not feel front-heavy. The adjustment knob makes tightening the HMD much easier. With the G2, as with the Index, there are many times throughout any given play session where I feel the need to fiddle with the top and side adjustment straps, whether it's because the foam has become compressed or the desire to open up a slight gap above the cheekbones to allow airflow in, with the G2, aside from the top-strap, making adjustments to the side-straps is so cumbersome that I usually just deal with whatever issue I have, be it unwarranted pressure on my cheekbones etc. With the VP2 making adjustments to the distance of the HMD with the dial is simple and ergonomic. \n\nUltimately the G2 gets a slight win here but only because of it's 500g weight and I do mean ever so slight win here. \n\nVersus Index\n\nVP2 is more comfortable than the Index hands down. This has to do with the VP2 having greater 50\/50 weight distribution front to rear. Yes, it's 830g, but ask most if not all Index owners and many will tell you the Index wasn't comfortable over long sessions until they, like myself, added a counterweight. I had to use StudioForm's 200g counterweight on my Index to get it to have the same weight distribution as the VP2, bringing total weight up from 799g to 999g or roughly 170g heavier than the VP2. \n\nThe cable is also much more flexible, thinner and lighter than the G2 (I measured). \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/h7pntl\/why\\_weight\\_review\\_of\\_studioform\\_creatives\\_index\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/h7pntl\/why_weight_review_of_studioform_creatives_index\/)\n\nReverb G2: 500g \/ 1.1 lbs\n\nVive Pro 2: 830g \/ 1.829 lbs\n\nIndex with counterweight: 2.2 lbs \n\n**Heat** \n\nThe VP2 @ 120 Hz, to my disbelief, feels as warm \/ cool as the G2 @ 90 Hz. This may have something to do with their being slightly less brightness, not sure. Both the VP2 and G2 are considerably cooler than the Index. In fact, I could not use the Index without a frunk fan. The VP2 and G2 feel almost as cool as the Index with Frunk fan. \n\n**Visuals**\n\nMy first observation was that the VP2 felt like I was using the G2 but with considerably greater HFOV (VFOV feels about the same, maybe slightly larger) but with really good blacks, better colors and contrast. Yes BETTER COLORS, particularly reds. I don't think it's just a warmer image, colors absolutely pop in the VP2 compared to the G2, and this is really saying something because the G2 has very good colors compared to the Index. Contrast and blacks, my god I had no idea how important blacks were, I mean this isn't OLED level blacks here but it's REALLY close \/ bridges the gap between LCD and OLED. I didn't even think this was possible with LCD. Also, zero ghosting, zero SDE. It's basically G2 level clarity but the radial blur \/ glare hampers this a bit. \n\nThe GLARE, yes the complaints of glare are absolutely real. If you don't like this with the Index get ready for comparable glare in the VP2. To give you an idea, if you stand in SteamVR home and look at the board all of the white text exhibits a kind of distortion that radiates from center to the periphery of the lenses. It takes come getting used to, it's not a deal breaker though, as the pros of the VP2, which I've attempted to describe here, vastly outweigh this one con. \n\n120 Hz. My god, I had no idea how much smoother things feel in VR at 120 Hz vs 90 but once you experience this it's painful to have to restart both Vive Console and SteamVR to reduce the refresh rate to 90 Hz if you intend to play a demanding title such as Asgards Wrath or Assetto Corsa Competizione above 60 Hz due to reprojection. \n\nI've attempted to describe the combination of both tracking and refresh rate improvement going from 90 Hz in the G2 to 120 Hz in the VP2 but it's ineffable, the tracking is perfect, the fluidity, it's absolutely an upgrade over the G2 in this regard. Tracking feels as good as the Index so if you have an Index you already know what to expect. \n\n**FOV**\n\nMeasured FOV for all three headsets: \n\nIndex 106 \/ 104\n\nG2 98 \/ 92\n\nVP2 117 \/ 96\n\nIf you have a G2 the VP2 feels like youre adding 20 degrees of HFOV to it. I have to point out that this is with a 10mm face-pad on the VP2 and 18mm replacement pad on the G2. \n\nI feel the exchange for HFOV for VFOV vs the Index is worth it but I'm someone who is on the ultra-wide monitor bandwagon who upgraded their 2D panel to a 21:9 IPS (AW3418DW) only to upgrade yet again to a Samsung Odyssey G9 under 2 years later. The G2 feels like looking at a 4:3 panel whereas VP2 feels in between 16:9 and 21:9. \n\nI would gladly trade 10 degrees of VFOV for HFOV and here's why. Playing Assetto Corsa Competizione last night, at one point I was in the middle of a long left hander @ Brands Hatch alongside a rival and I could maintain my position without hitting them without the need to choose between following the road or shifting my perspective out of my window to gauge my position with them. With the G2 \/ Index you have more tunnel vision and this kind of perspective is not possible. In this instance, who cares what your seat belt or headliner looks like (the 10 degrees lost in VFOV vs Index). The reason the FOV in the VP2 may not feel as good as the Index is because our natural eyesight has more VFOV than HFOV. When it comes to simulating reality however, horizontal FOV takes up precedence over vertical, hence the reason ultrawide 2D panels feel better than 16:9 or the reason the industry went from 4:3 to 16:9 in the first place. \n\n [What is a human FOV? (askinglot.com)](https:\/\/askinglot.com\/what-is-a-human-fov) \n\n**Performance**\n\nPixels are pixels, seeing roughly the same load as both the G2 and Index depending on what the resolution is. @ 120 Hz I set it to \\~2800x2800 for some super-sampling but to also be able to nail 120 Hz in semi-demanding titles. In The Lab this works out to roughly 55% GPU load, and \\~65% GPU load in SteamVR home and \\~85% load in VR Paradise (90 Hz) and TWD: Saints and Sinners (@ 120 Hz, maxed out settings) with an RTX 3090 under full water block (1980 MHz core + 500 MHz memory @ .938v @ 114% PT \/ 390w). What really surprised me however, was that just as of like a week ago while at starting grid at Brands Hatch in Assetto Corsa Competizione I would see my FPS dip down to like 60-70 FPS while driving past the stands at the start of the race with \\~70% GPU load (i7 8700k @ 5.1 GHz actual @ 1.38v, 0 AVX, delid, 1200kw rad surface area) in the Reverb G2. I was pleasantly surprised to see my FPS stay above 80 FPS here @ 80-90% load in the VP2! Apparently WMR is not only bug riddled garbage ware but it is very demanding of CPU resources as well. \n\n**Bugs \/ Issues**\n\nTo my surprise, based on some advice here (I was scouring this forum on an hourly basis over the weekend) I didn't install Viveport but simply connected the VP2 to the PC and started SteamVR at which point SteamVR prompts one to install Vive Console. This was straightforward. Calibrating the Index controllers was quick and simple in SteamVR. Zero issues here. I do however have a few issues. \n\n1. Camera passthrough is bugged, I've read here today that the solution is to opt into SteamVR beta and I will try that. \n2. There is a faint buzz in the headphones, as others have described, but it is extremely faint and one can only hear it if there is no audio present. \n\nNo other issues to report at this time. In fact, I'm head over heels for this headset coming from G2 + WMR. With G2 + WMR, on top of the aforementioned bugs and issues, simply to get a session going meant one had to restart their PC. If one does not clean restart their PC one will have problems and even after having installed a PCI-E USB hub (and I have a Z370 chipset, not X570!) WMR + G2 would lock up my PC a good 33% of the time. And after a VR session I would have some kind of odd latency where pressing a key on the keyboard would take literally 2 seconds for input to register with the only solution being to restart the PC once again! No such problems with the VP2! It's basically a flawless experience. There is no \"WMR forgot boundary\" crap, or drift issues if using Index controllers, nor camera induced jitter, and the tracking, especially combined with 120 Hz, it's otherworldly coming from G2. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI can't believe the bad reviews the VP2 is getting. To my eyes and head it's an amazing piece of kit. I love everything about this, ESPECIALLY the on ear headphones (for basestation isolation) and the sound quality isn't simply a downgrade compared to G2 \/ Index, yes it has less mids and bass BUT the treble is better, it's much crisper, combined with the sound isolation really facilitates immersion. I also don't find the headphones uncomfortable nor heat trapping. The volume button, every headset going forward should have one. Build quality and aesthetics, the build quality vastly exceeds the G2 and I would say approaches parity with the Index, it definitely loses a point for having a less satisfactory \/ intuitive IPD adjustment mechanism and that's about it. Also, I feel the need to reiterate, it's balanced front to rear and so therefore is more comfortable. The foam padding isn't as comfortable as the antimicrobial cloth of the G2 and Index, HOWEVER, you will be jettisoning the foam padding for a pleather pad to increase the FOV anyway. \n\nI absolutely love my VP2, there is no way it's going back. If I could sum it up I would say that it has near G2 level clarity and comfort with better audio (subjective) and vastly improved blacks, colors and contrast, zero SDE, nearly 20 degrees increase in HFOV and no WMR bullshit nor camera tracking bullshit. If you already own Index lighthouses and controllers you will love the G2. You will need a powerful PC! \n\nIf you have an Index, it's also an upgrade, again you have G2 level clarity, comparable glare, identical tracking, better comfort (again, it's balanced, Index isn't balanced until you add 200g to the rear), better blacks, contrast and colors and to me, I would gladly trade 10 VFOV for HFOV. \n\nI felt spurned to defend the merits of the VP2 due to the complete lack of positive posts here. This has been my experience, this is my opinion, to me the VP2 is amazing and I could not recommend it more highly ESPECIALLY if you have a powerful PC, a Reverb G2 + Index lighthouses and controllers and $800 to burn. \n\nThanks for reading my review.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169851,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A positive Vive Pro 2 review from former G2 and Index owner!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nvihip\/a_positive_vive_pro_2_review_from_former_g2_and\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Keyalelin","author_created_utc":1404326296,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":"","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":"","author_flair_text_color":"","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_h85ro","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623134063,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nuy946","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nuy946","no_follow":false,"num_comments":10,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nuy946\/vive_pro_2_first_impressions_from_a_g2index\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623542083,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"After some time using the Vive Pro 2 having daily drove a Valve Index, and then the Reverb G2 + Knuckles earlier this year I figured some people in a similar spot might want some impressions comparing the VP2 to them.  \n\nTo preface, my IPD is 60.8, eye depth is rather shallow and allows me to get the maximum FoV for most consumer headsets, or even see the edge of the panels. I'm also probably pickier than most, so take some of my nitpicking with a grain of salt. \n\nFirst up, the positives. \n\n+ Colors are very good. On par or maybe more saturated than the Reverb G2. \n+ FoV and Edge clarity are great with an 8mm face pad. It's quite noticeably wider than the Valve Index. With the face pad, I have zero complaints about the vertical FoV. With the stock pad, the FoV feels significantly more restrictive than even my G2 however. \n+ 120hz on a panel at this resolution is super nice, and ghosting is minimal\/non-existent. \n+ Native SteamVR tracking after using the G2 with Index Controllers has been very nice. No complaints here. \n+ *Tons* of room for glasses wearers. \n+ Lots of padding and cushioning. Very comfortable overall. \n+ Best blacks I've seen on an LCD headset. \n\nNow on to the negatives. Note that some of these may be very individual dependent, and their severity will vary. \n\n+ *My number one issue with this headset* has been the stereo overlap. I can't quite describe it, but it feels like at all times, my IPD is set incorrectly. Only about 30-40% of my view overlaps with both of my eyes, resulting in it feeling like I'm looking at a flat screen almost. This severely detracts from my immersion and contributes greatly to eye fatigue. As well, anything outside of this stereo view appears to suffer from barrel distortion to an extent. I presume this may be due to the double stack lens design, but I can't be sure. \n+ Panel brightness is not very good and is significantly more dim than the G2 or Index. This takes some of the \"wow\" factor out of VR for me, but for some people they won't be bothered at all due to it improving the black levels overall. \n+ Glare and internal reflections. While I thought the Index had it bad, the VP2 brings glare to a whole other level. Even in my SteamVR Home, I get glare and reflections from any and all text. As well, I noticed in some games (notably Beat Saber), I can see elements of the game reflecting on different parts of the lens. For example, I could see blocks appearing in the very far edges of the lens after being reflected through. This specific reflection aspect wasn't a large problem, but a result of the lens design nonetheless. The Valve Index had this, but not nearly as noticeable. \n+ The sweet spot where your eyes are best aligned is extremely small. I can nudge the side of the headset and suddenly my view becomes blurred and it has to be readjusted. There is *VERY* little room for IPD variation as a result. Even the IPD adjustment being 1mm off results in intense optical discomfort for me. \n+ Audio is mediocre at best, atrocious at worst. I would compare the headphones to a $30 pair of Sony on-ear headphones but with no bass. Even with an EQ and modding them to press against my ears more, the clarity feels lacking compared to the Index\/G2. There's also a noticeable static noise that comes through at all times, though I suspect this is a software issue considering some Vive Cosmos users have noted this issue appearing last week. \n+ The mic is terrible; not much else to say here. This is pretty well known. \n+ Chromatic aberration horizontally is fine, but vertically I notice it quite drastically. It's most noticeable on any sort of white text. Blues and greens bleed very badly. The 8mm face pad made this better, but it's still very noticeable. \n+ Performance is variable. On my 3090\/9900k on the ultra setting in the Vive console, SteamVR at 100% varies wildly. At one point it was set to 3228x3228 per eye, then the next time I booted up SteamVR, it went to 3998x3998per eye.  \n+ Panel clarity is overall better than the Index, but the image feels softer. The G2 feels significantly sharper and overall a more natural, clean image than the VP2. Whether this is a result of the lens or Display Stream Compression, I'm unsure. \n+ Lastly, the software is very finnicky. You have to use the Vive Console software to make the headset run. As a result, I've had SteamVR crash when launching and my controllers unpaired once. There's also no option to use SteamVR's native Motion Smoothing. Not a dealbreaker for me since I disable it most of the time, but could be a dealbreaker for sim players. \n\n\nOverall I'm very disappointed. I wanted a headset that had the benefits of the Reverb G2, but on native SteamVR tracking so I can avoid the mess that is MixedVR, but have been rather let down with this. \n\nI'll be giving the headset another week or so to see if it grows on me or if I can figure out solutions to some of the problems I've been having, but it's looking like I may be returning the headset.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 First Impressions from a G2\/Index Enthusiast","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.7,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nuy946\/vive_pro_2_first_impressions_from_a_g2index\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Excellent_Device879","author_created_utc":1599565646,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"new","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"4f9d5e8a-6c37-11e9-b35f-122677b24742","author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7uf9061w","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623086839,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623241738.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nui759","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"Custom viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"22c39da0-ae0a-11e5-b5ef-0ee7422a1981","link_flair_text":"\"Solved via ReVive\"","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nui759","no_follow":false,"num_comments":7,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nui759\/not_compatible_with_iracing_mixed_first\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623541238,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Got my headsets, first Impression:\n\n**Positives:**\n\n\\+ fov clearly better than reverb g2 and index.\n\n\\+ wide ratio doesnt feel weird, looks very similar to pimax, no outer distortions found (no mod used, minimal distance to the lens, ipd 63, small face, big nose).\n\n\\+ my big nose which made pimax for me unusable (due to nose pain) fitts perfectly fine with vive pro 2, it sits on my face and not on my nose.\n\n\\+ picture quality is something that requires more time to test, but the first impression its good, i cant say it worse than G2, but i also didnt made a direct comparison. Ultra profile 2448x2448 per eye (90hz), in steam oversampled to 2828x282 looks very good, i had no issues with sweetspot or anything else while driving.\n\n\\+ volume button is definitely good\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Neutrals:**\n\n1. strap is same as pimax one (or similar one), it feels wobbly for the first time, but it took me 5 minutes to adjust and get used. Maybe not very comfortable for game where you need rotate fast enough, but is just fine while sitting, looking left and right did not changed my sweetspot at all. For some people may require moding.\n2. sound acceptable, i actually liked overear speakers more than valve once, but the sound quality is just nothing special.\n3. performance - has some issues, had to lower my resolution compared to wmr (fov impact? layer issues? iracing implementation? No idea).\n4. sweetspot, yes, while configuring and watching for some text or user interface icons in iracing launcher \u2013 its indeed looks like sweetspot is almost non existent. But as mentioned above - i had no such issues while driving and i dont think its going to make issues in other games, maybe not good for reading but is acceptable for gaming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNegatives:\n\n\\- glare, not an issue while driving, but overall too much glare when you nterract with gui for example.\n\n\\- tracking is broken, already reported by vive, but for now its unplayable. Any movements \"up\/down\/side\" (3dof) causing world shift, while 6dof works as intended i believe. This is the only reason and main gamebraking issue with vive pro 2. I will wait for support reply to see what they respond, if they are going to address this any time soon i will wait till the next weekend to give a headset a chance. If no workaround from iracing or vive will be confirmed, i fear it makes barely any sense for further discussions of how bad or good it is, if its just not compatible with iRacing atm.\n\nOverall - i rather liked it than disliked but in current state its a ruined first experience and refund in a week or two, due to a bit wobbly strap and mainly because of the tracking issue that makes the game just unplayable. I liked the fov, resolution and lenses so far, except for hard pronounced glare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDay 2 update:\n\nI have spent more time with my vive pro 2 making direct comparison with G2, and i have something to add:\n\n\\- tracking with revive - perfect\n\n\\- headstrap, not an issue at all, not anymore\n\n\\- audio is seriously bad compared to index\n\n\\- sweetspot is non existent but i dont feel like the image is blurry and i lack it while racing. Yes, G2 in the middle has better clarity, but only in the center it looks a bit better, rest looks very similar and i must say that with vive pro 2 your clarity is very balanced across whole lense, its not like your center is 'a bit worse than g2 and outside is a blurry mess\", it looks good overall across whole fov.\n\n\\- horizontal FOV is very noticable, i have tried dalara in rookie series and i could see both side mirrors with my peripheral vision (up to 90% of each at the same time), while in G2 i could see both up to 25% only (meaning i had to move my head left or right in order to use side mirrors, with VP2 its not the case).j\n\n\\- vertical FOV is lessen than G2, but it didnt borthered me at all.\n\n\\- performance, through i was running with solid 90 fps there were scenarios were VP2 dropped a lot of frames while G2 did not. I dont know whats going on there, but i was testing both G2 and VP2 in a resolution of 2800x2800 (my card is capable of more) and in VP2 smoke effect killed 50% of my framerate with a CPU meter going above 10, while with G2 it stays below 5.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Not compatible with iRacing, mixed first impressions.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.63,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nui759\/not_compatible_with_iracing_mixed_first\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"aSmallIndieCompany","author_created_utc":1622650011,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"ascended","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"b86b93fa-6c37-11e9-8866-12b853345bae","author_flair_text":"","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_chizcwev","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623040713,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623099197.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nu412a","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nu412a","no_follow":false,"num_comments":43,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nu412a\/im_finding_pro_2s_god_rays_to_be_a_lot_worse_than\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623540488,"score":40,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Basically if you are staring at some text that\u2019s sitting exactly at the center of your sight, then it\u2019s fine.

I use the Quest 2 casually for a quick pick-up game here or there due to the wireless convenience, but the modded Vive Pro is my go-to headset for any serious gaming, and to this day, I still consider it one of the best overall VR experiences available.  I have also owned both the Valve Index and the Reverb G2, and in each case,  stuck with the modded Vive Pro and sold the other HMD.\n\nThe Valve Index really didn't come close to replacing my modded Vive Pro.  I found that the OLED-level blacks, vibrant colors, superior contrast, edge-to-edge clarity, and complete lack of god-rays and glare offered by the modded Vive Pro were far more important to me than the slightly diminished SDE, higher refresh rate and FOV offered by the Index.  The Index only lasted a few weeks before I sold it.  I did keep the knuckles controllers though.  They are awesome. \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe G2 lasted a few months, though we had a real love-hate relationship the entire time.  The G2 never really stood a chance of fully supplanting my Vive Pro.  I'm not sure any HMD with LCD panels will ever manage that, but with the bump in resolution and improvement in SDE, I did seriously consider keeping it along side the Vive Pro for games where blacks and contrast aren't a priority.   The clarity and sharpness of the G2 in the sweet spot was simply amazing...but I found the drop in sharpness as you move out from the center of the sweet spot to be fairly abrupt, so always had this sense that things in the periphery were out of focus.  Never could quite get used to that.  In addition, I found the native inside-out tracking to be sub-par, and the complexity of managing a mixed VR system on top of WMR to be too complex.  It was a real pain moving between my Vive Pro and G2, so the G2 eventually went on e-bay in search of a new home.\n\n# Expectations for the Vive Pro 2\n\nSo, why did I order a Vive Pro 2?  My hope is that it will offer some of the visual advantages of the G2, but in a native Steam VR configuration where I can seamlessly swap between my original Vive Pro and the Vive Pro 2, depending on which types of games I'm playing.\n\n# Initial Impressions\n\n* **Audio** \\- I definitely hear a humming noise from the earphones when other sounds aren't playing.  Not so noticeable in game when any other audio is playing, but it's there.  It's similar to what I've experienced on my Vive Pro with some poor quality USB C headphone adapters.  I am using a USB-C headphone adapter with a decent DAC now on my Vive Pro that doesn't have this issue, so I may try it out on the Vive Pro 2 just to see if the noise goes away.   Not sure if this is present on all headsets, or just a some (I've heard at least one other report).\n* **Brightness** \\- The display is definitely not as bright as the G2 (nor the Vive Pro, which is very bright).  I'd say the brightness on the VP2 about matches what I see when I turn on night mode on the orignal Vive Pro.  I don't really see this as a problem, as it feels bright enough to me, but it's worth noting.\n* **Black Levels &amp; Contrast** \\-  It's an LCD, so no surprise that the blacks and contrast in dark scenes are pretty terrible as compared to the OLED Vive Pro.  Simply not suitable for any caves, dark basements, sewers, etc., IMHO. The blacks do feel notably darker than on the G2 though, which surprised me a bit.  I expect the overall lower brightness plays a role here, and as a result, the overall contrast may also be slightly less than with the G2 as well.  I didn't perceive this as an issue when using the headset.  For me personally, in games where this is a concern, I'd likely be using the OLED Vive Pro in any case.\n* **Sweet Spot** \\- I didn't really have any problem dialing in the sweet spot on the VP2.  Probably futzed with the headset a lot less than I typically did with my G2.\n* **Clarity &amp; Sharpness** \\- I know others have reported it, but even so, this one surprised me. There was a lot of content and testing I did with the G2 when I had it, so even without the G2 on hand for a side-by-side comparison, I can tell that the Vive Pro isn't quite as sharp.   This was with the Vive Console set to Extreme, and Steam VR SS cranked to 200% (ignoring performance and focusing on clarity).  I'd say the 10% number others have been throwing around is probably pretty accurate.  On the other hand,  I find the focus uniformity of the VP2 to be a lot more consistent, and I don't have that sense that things just outside the center of my vision are slightly out of focus.  I do prefer the Vive Pro 2 here.\n* **FOV** \\- I haven't taken any actual measurements yet, nor played with thinner 3rd party face gaskets  but even with the stock gasket, I do perceive the wider overall field-of-view as compared to both the G2 and the Vive Pro.  As for the narrower Vertical FOV,  I didn't really notice it and certainly don't see it as a problem.  Overall, I think the VP2 has a nice bump in perceived FOV.  I'll try it with some thinner gaskets I have laying around at some point to see if I can get an even bigger bump, but doesn't feel necessary to me.\n* **God Rays &amp; Glare** \\- This one is the real kicker, and from my initial assessment the only real visual downside of the VP2 as compared to the G2.   God Rays  &amp; Glare were actually pretty minimal on the G2, but they are definitely present on the VP2.   It's been long enough since I had my Valve Index that it's hard to say how they compare, but they are certainly consistent with what I recall from the time.  My modded Vive-Pro has no god-rays or glare, so this was a significant factor in why I sold the Index at the time.  I know a lot of Index owners get use to looking past this, so I'll need to give it more time to see how distracting it is in actual gameplay.\n\n# Initial Assessment\n\nMy initial assessment is that I do prefer the VP2 to the Reverb G2, but the jury is still out on whether I'll be keeping it.   I'll need more time to decide how much the God Rays and Glare are going  to be an issue.\n\nThe VP2 does work very well along side my original Vive Pro.  I actually have my knuckles controllers on a pair of dongles (rather than paired via the HMD), so I literally just have to pull out one HMD or the other and plug it into the breakout box, grab my controllers, and I'm good to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Assessment (Added 6\/5\/2021 @ 10:30PM MT)\n\nAfter spending most of the day today putting the Vive Pro 2 through it's paces, some of my original impressions have changed, so I though I'd provide a quick update.  \n\n**Vs. Valve Index**\n\nI think the Vive Pro 2 is probably a solid upgrade to the Valve index.  It does have a lot of the same drawbacks as the Index with regard to glare and god-rays due to similar lens design, but if you're OK with those on the Index, you'll probably be OK with them on the Vive Pro 2.  It also retains a high refresh rate and wide FOV similar to that of the Index, while completely eliminating SDE and giving a pretty significant bump in resolution.\n\n**Vs. Reverb G2**\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 has a clear advantage over the Reverb G2 with regard to both it's superior tracking and it's wide field of view.  In the case of the FOV, I was able to get the FOV on the G2 pretty much out to the physical edge of the displays using 3D printed face gaskets, and I still don't think it compared with the FOV on the VP2 with the stock face plate.\n\nI originally felt that the Vive Pro 2 was better than the G2 in terms of sweet spot and focus uniformity, but after another day of use, I'd call it a wash.  I think they are probably in about the same league here, and honestly, neither is particularly great.  This isn't as noticeable when playing games, but when reading text or using Virtual Desktop the sweet spot feels fairly small on both.  The Vive Pro 2 does have slightly better absolute blacks than the G2, but as both are LCD panels, it really doesn't make a huge difference in content where blacks and contrast are important, so I'd consider this a wash as well.\n\nThe Reverb G2 has surprisingly little glare and god-rays, whereas on the Vive Pro 2, the glare and god-rays are fairly easy to see, particularly on high contrast content.  If you look at something bright on a dark background, you're going to be able to see the concentric circles from the Fresnel lenses in the periphery, and even the center of vision will experience glare and some loss of contrast.  Again, this is very dependent on the content being viewed, but when you see it, you see it, and it's not particularly hard to find glare\/god-ray susceptible content...it's visible even in the SteamVR menu.\n\n**Parting thoughts**\n\nI've boxed the VP2 up and will be returning it.   In the end, the advantages of the VP2 with respect to FOV and resolution weren't enough to offset the disadvantages with regard to sweet spot, glare, and god-rays.  For the time being, I'll just be sticking with my Vive Pro and Quest 2.  That combo is actually fairly well balanced, and both of those HMDs has a solid sweet spot with minimal to no glare or god-rays as compared to the VP2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169849,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Another Initial Impressions of the Vive Pro 2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.89,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nsimux\/another_initial_impressions_of_the_vive_pro_2\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[{"award_sub_type":"GLOBAL","award_type":"global","awardings_required_to_grant_benefits":null,"coin_price":150,"coin_reward":0,"count":2,"days_of_drip_extension":0,"days_of_premium":0,"description":"Thank you stranger.

VR enthusiasts, \n\nI had been working on this like crazy, and here it finally is: my full in-depth review of the Vive Pro 2! It is my longest and most in-depth review to date. I strive to give you all the information you need to make an educated purchasing decision. That's why it needed to be a bit longer... :) But now, without further ado, here is my full review in text format for your kind perusal: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVive Pro 2 - The MRTV Review\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 is HTC's latest PCVR headset that is aimed at enterprise customers and VR enthusiasts alike. It promises a wider 120\u00b0 FOV and high-end VR experience thanks to its upgraded resolution of 2.5k \\* 2.5k pixels per eye and a higher 120hz refresh rate. Now does HTC keep those promises and is the device worth the 799$ asking price for the headset only?\n\nThe answer will depend on many factors, one being from which headset you want to upgrade from and what is important for you in a headset.\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 is a solid update as far as visuals are concerned but other than that plays it safe and does not stray away too much from the original Vive Pro formula. For some parts that's good, for others it is quite hard to understand in a competitive environment that pits it against innovative headsets like the Valve Index or the Reverb G2.\n\nBuild-quality &amp; Comfort\n\nLet's start with the basics. HTC has not made any design-changes. From outside you could not tell the Pro 1 and 2 apart if it was not for some slight color changes. That was probably the most economic way to bring the device to market, but that also does not help to make the device more exciting from a consumer's standpoint.\n\nHowever, the Pro 2 is just as sturdy and well built as its predecessor and it has just as many options to adjust it to the individual user. We have manual IPD adjustment with a range from 57mm to 70.5mm and there is eye relief so glasses wearers can make more room to wear their glasses within the headset.\n\nThe headstrap allows users to quickly adjust size with an adjustment knob and I personally prefer this over velcro solutions like the one of the Reverb G2 any day.\n\nSupporting images: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/) \n\nVive Pro 1 Headphones Left - Vive Pro 2 Headphones Right\n\nFor the headphones HTC actually did make a change. They are still on-ear but at least the part that touches the user's ears has been updated and feels better, especially for longer play sessions. This has to compete against the now industry Gold Standard of the floating Valve Index headphones though and we will get to that discussion when we talk about audio in this review.\n\nOverall, the build quality is great. I especially want to point out the cable management here. It is well thought through and the cable is being led from the headset itself to the back of the headstrap in the most unobstructive and elegant way.\n\nTalking about the cable, the Pro 2 is also compatible with the Vive Wireless module, so if you prefer wireless gameplay that is possible as well at an added expense of $349 and I will review the wireless performance in a separate review.\n\nSince design-wise nothing has changed, the Pro 2 is also compatible with the HTC Vive Facial tracker which should be good news for anyone that is interested to use it for social VR experiences.\n\nComfort of the Pro 2 is great. Thanks to the excellent headstrap the device sits on your head in a balanced way. There is no front heaviness and cushions are as soft and accommodating as ever. Wearing the Pro 2 feels like putting your head into a comfy sofa. People coming from headsets that do not offer such lavish cushioning might have to get used to that kind of comfort first.\n\nVisuals\n\nBut now let's get to the upgrades! Virtual Reality is all about immersion and the visuals play a major role in that. HTC has massively upgraded the Pro 2 in this department. The Pro 2 now features two LCD panels with a resolution of 2.5k by 2.5k pixels per eye that boast a refresh rate of 120hz. And boy do these panels look great!\n\nSupporting Through The Lens Videos here: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/) \n\nAs was to be expected, the screen door effect is now truly a thing of the past and there are no ugly pixel gaps left that would remind us of looking at a screen instead of just feeling immersed. The pixel density per degree that headsets like the Pro 2 or Reverb G2 offer seems to be the sweetspot for making that happen. Virtual worlds simply look fantastic within the Pro 2 and the resolution allows for sharpness and clarity that so far only the Reverb G2 could offer. VR veterans coming from all other major headset companies will without a doubt perceive this bump in the visual department and will adopt it as the new standard quickly.\n\nThe panels don't just offer a high resolution, they also offer vibrant colors and high contrast. This is in fact the best LCD panel in terms of color reproduction that I have seen in a VR headset yet. The only panel that comes close in terms of colors for an LCD panel is that one of the Reverb G2, but if I had to chose the better one, I'd still give it to the Pro 2 because colors simply have a bit more intensity and contrast is a bit higher which makes for really dark blacks. It is still not an OLED panel, but LCD has actually made quite some improvements as far as contrast is concerned. If you are coming from the Valve Index, you will without a doubt directly be able to tell that the colors of this panel are superior, same goes for users that come from the Pimax headsets that sport an LCD panel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFOV\n\nField of View! Oh yes, we always wanted more and now we have finally been heard! Does the Vive Pro 2 really deliver an FOV of 120\u00b0 horizontally that is wider than that of the Valve Index? Yes it does!\n\nBut without a doubt I foresee quite a bit of controversy here because HTC chose an unfamiliar FOV ratio. So far in VR headsets the horizontal FOV kind of matched the vertical one. We looked into virtual worlds through oval windows, perhaps comparable to a 4:3 TV set. Now HTC expects us to learn a new trick and adapt to more of a wider 16:9 like ratio, because the vertical FOV is visibly smaller than the horizontal one. Also, the window into VR is now more squarish than oval and that does take getting used to.\n\nSo how large is that FOV then?\n\nUsing Risa2000's hmdq tool we can find out the FOV that is actually rendered for the device, so that is the de facto maximum that you could see in the very best case. For the Pro 2 that is 117.25 deg horizontally and 96.54 deg vertically. For comparison, here are the values for Index and Reverb G2:\n\nPro 2: 117.25 deg (h) - 96.54 deg (v)\n\nReverb G2: 98.85 deg (h) - 90.85 deg (v)\n\nValve Index: 108.06 deg (h) - 109.16 deg (v)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow many degrees of FOV are being rendered and how many you actually see within the headset will also depend on how well optimized the device is and on your individual anatomy. I have a very standard IPD of 64mm and when I actually look through the device and measure how much I see using the TestHMD tools, I get to 114 deg (h) and 90 deg (v), using the standard facepad that comes with the device. That is better than the 108 deg (h) I see in the Index horizontally, but worse than the 100 deg (v) I see vertically there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy very first reaction when I looked through the Pro 2 was: I am getting less FOV! I could not appreciate the wider horizontal FOV at all. Actually I had the feeling I would even see less. It honestly speaking felt weird for me to see that unfamiliar FOV ratio. It felt like looking at a 4:3 screen all my life and then looking at a 16:9 screen for the first time. My knee-jerk reaction was to dismiss the device and I am pretty sure we will see that initial knee-jerk reaction play out to its fullest hyperbole potential on YouTube as soon as the device drops! (\"OMG, I AM LOOKING THROUGH A MAILBOX SLOT!!! SMALLEST FOV EVER!!!\").\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I did give the device a chance to grow on me and that was a very good decision. On the second day, it did not feel weird to me at all anymore and I could appreciate that in fact I can see more of the virtual worlds than before. It is still unfortunate that we do not see that FOV increase vertically as well so we would not have to get used to this new kind of ratio.\n\nMy concerns about the FOV ratio completely faded though when I found out that there is plenty of room to increase the visible FOV by getting my eyes closer to the displays. The facial padding that comes with the device is kind of thick and therefore I simply replaced it with a thinner VR Cover and then I had the experience I was hoping for! I could finally enjoy the wider FOV to its fullest extent. With that thinner facepad I then measured an FOV of 116 deg (h) - 96 deg (v) and that did make a huge difference. So, FrankenFOV away, dear modders! For my modding, I used the Cool XG Foam form VR Cover. It is actually for Quest 2 but fits well and is really slim for much FOV. (US-Link, EU-Link, INT-Link)\n\nYou will even get better results here than modding the Reverb G2 using thinner facepads. So after modding, you get a visual experience that plays in Reverb G2 territory with a wider FOV than the Valve Index, and that is quite a proposition for all the people that care about visuals more than anything else in VR.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLenses\n\nAfter having used the same lenses for years now HTC finally introduces new ones for the Pro 2. We are now looking through a double stacked pair of lenses, a technology that we know from the Valve Index. Just as with its direct competitor, this lens design allows for a wider field of view.\n\nUnfortunately though Fresnel lenses with their typical concentric rings are being used once again. And as we know, those are prone to god rays. For non double stacked lens designs like those of the Reverb G2 or the Oculus headsets, glare has already been reduced to a degree that it is not a big issue anymore. For the double stacked design of the Valve Index though, we had huge problems with glare. Unfortunately, the Pro 2 also is plagued with similar problems. The glare is not as pronounced as in the Valve Index, but it is still a problem nonetheless. If the godray problem of the Valve Index put you off, you won't feel differently here.\n\nIn standard playing sessions, you will likely not be bothered by it, just as it is the case with the Valve Index. In high contrast scenes you will see glare though, like white text on a black background. In these situations the glare will take away from the beautiful clarity of the panels and that is also the reason why in direct a\/b comparisons with the Reverb G2 I often prefered the picture quality of the latter, simply because there is less lens glare. So if you are used to the Reverb G2, you will see more lens glare, if you are used to the Valve Index, you will see a little less, but in general you know what to expect.\n\nAlso in terms of sweetspot we unfortunately do not see any improvements. In order to get to the position that will grant you the sharpest picture quality over the complete panel, you will need to adjust the headset for quite a bit. If you are coming from headsets with better sweetspots like the Oculus ones, you will find that you probably need a bit longer to find that ideal position.\n\nHowever, in direct comparison to the Valve Index, I do not see any disadvantages here since also with that headset you will need some time to find the perfect adjustment.\n\nOnce you are in that sweetspot though, you will get a clear picture.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupporting Video Here: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/) \n\nVive Pro 2 Sweetspot &amp; Edge To Edge Clarity\n\nAlso the edge-to-edge clarity is on par with the Index. Like with all Fresnel lenses there is a certain amount of clarity degradation the further you get to the peripheral areas though and to get a completely perfect picture quality we simply need to go away from Fresnel lenses and reintroduce the clear aspheric lenses back to VR! The first company to do that for the consumer market will without any doubts not only get lots of  goodwill but also the dollars of many happy customers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo overall, the Pro 2 is a very solid visual upgrade that scores with its fantastic high resolution panels that offer best in class colors in that display category. The wider FOV is a nice add-on that especially shines when you are able to get your eyes as close as possible to the lenses. The viewing pleasure is only clouded by glare in high contrast scenes caused by lenses that do not improve on the Valve Index double-stacked lens formula.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAudio\n\nThe Valve Index has introduced a stellar audio solution with its floating headphone design that is now the de facto Gold standard. And any headset that plays in the high-end enthusiast market must compete with that standard.\n\nThe Pro 2 offers standard on-ear headphones that have been improved in terms of their design. They look better and more importantly feel better on your ears now also for longer playing sessions.\n\nI have already gotten used to not having headphones touch my ears and I personally do prefer the Index solution. However, I can also appreciate the notion that some people want to be shut off completely from the real world. For these people on-ear headphones that block noise coming from the outside are preferable and the Pro 2 offers such a solution.\n\nThe audio quality itself will be good enough for the majority of consumers. I could tell that the Valve Index headphones offer a better audio quality, especially in the bass department, but the Pro 2 headphones also did not put me off. Audiophiles will without a doubt prefer the Valve Index solution though.\n\nAudio Comparison here: [https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/](https:\/\/mrtv.co\/2021\/05\/vive-pro-2-review\/) \n\nThe headphones are an acceptable audio solution but HTC shows no ambition here to actually compete with the best solution that is on the market now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMicrophone\n\nOh.My.God. It is hard to express how disappointing it is to see that HTC again did not manage to improve the microphone quality. In every single one of my previous Vive headset reviews I have pointed out that the microphone is just utter garbage. It was already quite unbelievable for me that the company did not improve the microphone from Original Vive to Vive Pro, but missing that upgrade again here is quite honestly inexplicable. The problem is not so much the audio quality itself, but the missing pop filter. Any \"p\" sound will result in loud and ugly pop noises that will easily identify you as a Vive customer in social VR situations. That is especially bad for enterprise customers that want to use the headset for Virtual meetings and quite frankly at this point simply embarrassing for HTC.\n\nI have tried to improve the pop noise problem by attaching windfilters for camera microhphones and the results are actually pretty good. Those will cost not more than a dollar and will allow you to interact with other people in VR without giving away that you are using a Vive headset.\n\nI have reached out to HTC about the microphone issue and I was told they will try to improve the situation on the software side. That is the same answer I got when I reviewed the orignal Vive Pro so I am not hopeful here. HTC must pro-actively find a solution for this problem. I suggest at least putting a free pop filter in the box, as embarrassing as it might be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nControllers\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 does not come with any new controllers. If you go for the full package at $1399, you will receive a pair of base stations needed for tracking and the Vive Wand controllers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Wand controllers have been around since the very first Vive came out and I will not review them here again. For business customers they should do the trick but gaming enthusiasts will without a doubt use the Valve Index controllers instead which are fully compatible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was at first disappointed when I learned that we would not get any new controllers with the Pro 2 but considering the fact that this is most likely only interesting for enthusiasts anyways who upgrade from an existing lighthouse compatible headset, it is understandable. HTC told me a new controller offering for gamers would unlikely add any value to the existing eco-system.\n\nThat being the case I would have hoped for HTC to work together with Valve to offer the Pro 2 in a bundle with those Valve Index controllers for customers who are new to exactly this eco-system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance\n\nWith all those pixels that need to be rendered, you rightfully ask yourself now: can you actually run this beast? The answer is YES, you can! At least that is what I deduct from my tests conducted on my RTX3080 system (no surprises here) but also on my weaker GTX1080ti machine. In both cases the Pro 2 ran very well and actually better than my Reverb G2.\n\nOn my RTX3080 the Vive software allowed me to choose from 5 settings:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance (2448\\*1224, 120hz)\n\nBalanced (3264\\*1632, 90hz)\n\nHigh (3672\\*1632, 90hz)\n\nUltra (4896\\*2448, 90hz)\n\nExtreme (4896\\*2448, 120hz)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor my tests I chose the Extreme setting since I wanted to max out the Pro 2. I was pleasantly surprised by how well all my games were running at this maximum fidelity. I could play Half-Life: Alyx at its highest graphic settings at a constant 120 fps and it simply looked stunning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe know that Half-Life Alyx is a very well optimized game that runs well on lots of machines so therefore I also tested more demanding titles such as Xplane 11 or Project Cars 2. For both games I managed to achieve a very respectable 60 fps, a feat that I could not pull off with my Reverb G2 at full visual fidelity on that same system.\n\nIn order to allow for better comparisons with other headsets, I ran the OpenVR Benchmark tool. For all readers who are not familiar with that benchmark: it is freely available on SteamVR and will render a very demanding scene that is designed to put the GPUs and the headsets connected to them to the test.\n\nFor the Vive Pro 2 I achieved a very respectable 33.6 fps on the RTX 3080. Compared to the 28fps that the Reverb G2 scored on the same system, you can tell that the Pro 2 performs quite a bit better than the Reverb G2. How is that possible? The Reverb G2 renders quite a higher resolution at 100% SS for its frame buffer and therefore is not quite as performant as the Pro 2. If you own an RTX 3080 you could run the OpenVR benchmark tool with your current VR headset and compare your results with the ones achieved with the Vive Pro 2.\n\nOn my GTX1080ti system, I could not choose the Ultra and Extreme option, so I went for the \u201cHigh\u201d setting. Of course I also ran Half-Life: Alxy here. Even at that lower resolution I saw a nice bump in visual fidelity over the Valve Index. The high fill-factor simply makes the difference and will eliminate any screen door effect, no matter if you run it at very high resolutions or not.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that I could run Half-Life: Alyx at a constant 90 fps on that older machine, with visuals that were absolutely gorgeous, still.\n\nTo be able to test the performance more generally, I also ran the OpenVR benchmark here. On that 1080ti machine the tool was able to render an average of 38.49 fps which was even a better result than I could get on the 3080 machine, at a lower resolution of course though.\n\nIf my results could be replicated on similar setups it would mean that the Pro 2 is an exciting upgrade proposition for enterprise customers and VR enthusiasts that want to enjoy wider FOVs and visuals without screen door effect using their existing setups, without the need to get faster GPUs. And that is truly a great proposition, especially in times like these, when it is hard to get by a new GPU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 is a solid upgrade in terms of visuals and FOV that many customers will enjoy. You can expect Reverb G2 level visuals on a wider than Valve Index FOV.\n\nHTC played it a bit too safe here though to call the Pro 2 an \u201cexciting\u201d or \u201cmust-have\u201d update: we didn\u2019t get a facelift for the design (bearable), but more importantly HTC did not have the ambition to also compete for the best audio solution and they completely dropped the ball on the microphone (again).\n\nFor VR enthusiasts that are willing to mod that microphone though by adding a $1 pop filter and that do not insist on the floating Valve Index headphones, the Vive Pro 2 is a solid upgrade that will not force them to upgrade their existing GPUs. But once the high-end GPUs will be more broadly available, the headset will give you these \u201cUltra\u201d and \u201cExtreme\u201d graphic settings to really show you what it can do.\n\nIn order to help you make a more informed purchasing decision, I will give you my advice based on the headset that you currently own.\n\nIf you own a Valve Index and are happy with it, I am not going to tell you that your Index is not good enough anymore. The Index is a hell of a headset and the panel still looks good enough, if you are not already used to higher resolution screens like that of the Reverb G2. It has a microphone that is so much better and an audio solution that still is unmatched. If you deeply care about that microphone and the floating headphones, sit this one out.\n\nHowever, if you ever so enviously looked over at the Reverb G2 crowd and also wished to enjoy these incredibly sharp high-resolution panels with even better colors, you can now have that together with the tracking solution that you love and an even wider FOV. I myself am in exactly that category. I really enjoyed the Index, but the Reverb G2 has spoiled it for me in terms of visuals. I am therefore glad that we now have a lighthouse version with an even bigger FOV, therefore I will personally keep my pre-order for the Pro 2. I already bought a pack of 10 glue-on pop filters, so I will be alright with that microphone.\n\nIf you own a Reverb G2 though the situation is a bit different. You are already used to that high-end visual experience in VR and you even have better lenses with less glare. Moreover, if you do not own Lighthouse base stations and controllers, this upgrade would cost you $1400 for sure and that is quite a sum. If you cannot stand Reverb G2 controllers and look for better tracking and a wider FOV then that is the price you have to pay though. But perhaps you still have base stations and controllers lying around?\n\nFor owners of a Vive or a Vive Pro the Vive Pro 2 is a really good and even recommended update. Without the need to update your GPU you will get a much better visual fidelity and a wider FOV. For Vive Pro users who are used to their device running hot, you will now get a headset that is not plagued by this problem. However, you will feel the change from Oled to LCD, even though this is a really good LCD panel. But still, the blacks of OLED headsets are still unmatched by any LCD panel up to date.\n\nIf you own any of the Pimax headsets for their huge FOV then for the first time since the Valve Index, you might actually want to explore this new option though. Especially when modded, the Pro 2 can give you an FOV that will get into the FOV territory that you enjoy most, completely without any distortions.\n\nIn terms of visual quality the Pro 2 trumps all the Pimax offerings. The only Pimax headset that can compete in terms of pixel per degree is the 8 KX, however the colors are way better on the Pro 2 panel and you get that with 120hz.\n\nIf you own a Quest or Quest 2, and you want to get into the high-end PCVR market, you might consider picking this one up. You will get way better visuals, colors and FOV, however the expenditure is most probably too high, and you could rather just go for a G2 or an Index instead. Probably just keep that Quest 2 though and wait for the Quest 2 Pro.\n\nOverall, the Vive Pro 2 is a solid update. Not an exciting one, but solid nevertheless and it will help us to bridge the time until we enthusiasts get that OLED, high-def beast that uses aspherical, no-glare lenses, that we are all dreaming of.\n\nSebastian Ang, 28th of May, 2021","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169855,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My Full In-Depth Vive Pro 2 Review (Sebastian, MRTV)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":6,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nnc3cx\/my_full_indepth_vive_pro_2_review_sebastian_mrtv\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Heligolander2048","author_created_utc":1486752273,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_159re1","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1621388634,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nfsj9q","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"gm automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nfsj9q","no_follow":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nfsj9q\/can_any_program_render_a_game_in_ultrawide\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623512833,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I was hoping the Vive folks here could help me hunt down some software that has a specific feature I'm after.\n\nFor context, I'm trying to play a racing game in VR that doesn't support it.

To add to this, i\u2019ve come up essentially running in circles with no real luck on the almighty Google searches with seemingly no one else experiencing this issue. Alright, enough of me whining here, now here\u2019s me whining more but in a different paragraph.\n\nSo i purchased my Vive around a year and a half ago from a reputable Ebay seller (i know, red flag yadayada \u2018should\u2019ve expected problems\u2019)\nwith no issues. it was a good price and i was willing to get my hands on it and experience VR for big boys. That first year and some odd months i had absolutely no issues with hardware or anything. Never touched the base stations or anything and i took excellent care of my controllers and HMD. Since around November, however, i had noticed the tracking got a bit wonky here and there, but it\u2019s old and i thought maybe it was just normal for the time when it was made. Fast forward to around December and i noticed one of my base stations was constantly going back and fourth with the normal \u2018tracking\u2019 LEDs (solid bright green dot at top, and 9 red\/purple lights below it) and the \u2018obstructed\u2019 indicator (blue\/purple light and no red lights.) \nDespite this, it was absolutely not obstructed, as i took great care to not touch\/move them unless i needed to and my play area has ample space with no obstructions besides me in the center. After taking to the internet i found it could be from vibrations or overheating, so naturally i hung my hat and unplugged the base station in question to cool off and maybe give it a well deserved rest. Moving into just a few days ago, i decided i wanted to give modding H3VR a try so i got all my stuff out and started to pick up where i left off. Everything seemed fine at first but i noticed that upon starting SteamVR the same base station in question was not being detected (greyed out icon in the application) even though it had no error-indicating LEDs on the front of the base station. Of course, i immediately took to the internet and came up pretty disappointed with the lack of similar problems. Twice i was able to by some miracle get the problematic base station to track but my tracking for the controllers and HMD would be very awry and i would clip though the floor and my controllers would either not track or track improperly. Also upon restart of the SteamVR app the base station would continue to not detect. i\u2019m really not sure if this is firmware, software, or hardware related but it\u2019s frustrating nonetheless. I suppose i\u2019m just pulling out every shot i have to not have to buy a new base station. If anyone has any ideas\/suggestion to lend it would be greatly appreciated as i would love to continue my VR journeys once again :)\n\nTL;DR:\none of my base stations is not being detected in SteamVR and, when it did detect only twice, my controllers and HMD were improperly tracked.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169809,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Base station not detecting, and having severe tracking issues when i can get it to detect.

It helps highlight the user flair text over the user name on some reddit interfaces and helps with achieving transparency in cases of self promotion.   There  is no strict qualification to claim a developer's flair.  However, developers are expected to be creators of virtual reality experiences who can contribute to that discussion.

Flair text should NOT be a url or otherwise appear as an advertisement (e.g. product benefits or a slogan).   A personal twitter handle is acceptable.\n\n\n**Note on verification and improper flair use**\n\nSubreddit moderators do not verify the information posted here or the accuracy of awarded developer flairs.  However, improper use of flairs won't be tolerated.  You may be asked to provide specific verification for any claims on identity.  In addition, some flairs may be withdrawn if their use is not meaningful or useful for discussions.     \n\n\n**Registering official company account names**\n\nPlease use a reddit account presenting yourself as individual rather than trying to be an \"official company account\" or a product-specific promotional account.  It is expected that you will take part in a range of conversations as an individual and not just promote stuff.  \n\n---------\n\n### Self Promotion\n\nPlease note that self promotion that does not contribute to discussion or fit the nature of the subreddit isn't tolerated.

After five minutes of use my left joystick started getting stuck at full deflection. They also just feel cheap and flimsy, with the battery cover flexing when you grip them.

I cannot figure out the reason for that problem.\n\nSo, I have 2 HTC Vive HMDs. Second-hand one, and a brand new one.\n\nThe second-hand Vive was my first fair price buy. I knew what to expect. The right eye display was slightly darker, from top to center. It wasn't that obvious, unless the scene was low light, so I got used to it. The issue started as the \"darkening\" progressed, and, fairly soon, it covered the entire eye, and started creating \"glittering\" effect - the effect that you perceive when both of your eyes see different image at the same time.   \nBefore buying my first HMD, I've learned about most precautions:  \n\\- keeping it away from the sun.  \n\\- keeping the lenses covered.  \n\\- not to hit\/damage the HMD.  \n\\- let no water\/sweat in.  \n\\- keep the SteamVR disabled, so backlight on HMD won't burn out.  \n\\- keep lighthouses disabled, so they won't drain their motor resources.  \nAll that was considered, so I can say that the further degradation is not something I've unintentionally allowed to happen.\n\nThings I've tried replacing so far:  \n\\- Vive HMD-to-Link cable  \n\\- HDMI port cable  \n\\- HTC Vive Link box  \n\\- Videocard  \n\\- Entire PC\n\nThings I've tried reinstalling\/hard-resetting so far:  \n\\- Windows 10  \n\\- SteamVR  \n\\- HL:Alyx and VRChat(those are the games I perceive the issue at)\n\nGot a brand new HTC Vive HMD, and was happy with it, but pretty soon after, the dark spot started growing from the top side, again. (At the moment I'm editing this post, the right eye is now completely darkened, with a slight hint of a properly working brightness at the far left side.

I got back from college 2 days ago, and when I went to play my games, SteamVR gave me the error code 213 and says \"Laptop: Headset display disconnected\" and says to check my cables and that Laptops may need extra setup. This is extremely weird since the last time I came home earlier this month everything worked perfectly. I've already tried a whole lot of stuff to try and fix the issue (listed below) and nothing has worked. I even used a desktop with a 1060 to try and get the headset to work, but unfortunately that didn't work either.

The headset is also receiving power and is detected via USB.\n\nI uninstalled all Vive and SteamVR related apps and then reinstalled them and went through the setup again, with the Vive setup app not detecting HDMI from the headset.\n\nI tried using the headset on another VR capable desktop computer with a dedicated GPU, and got error code 208 and then after trying some of the fixes I already used, it changed to 108, and then stopped detecting my headset altogether.\n\nI tried plugging the HDMI from the 3-in-1 cable directly into my laptop's HDMI port, and the error code did not change.\n\nI tried reverting nvidia drivers to one I knew worked, but nothing changed.\n\nI tried enabling SteamVR beta mode, still no change\n\nEdit: I've checked the cables on the headset multiple times as well, and gave a nice push to all of them just to make sure they were in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm getting close to just giving up, but if anyone else has any suggestions I'll try them out\n\nThanks for reading my wall of text, sorry if its formatted really poorly\n\nEdit 3 months later: if anyone in the future has this problem, I couldn't find a solution, but I still have my vive and will continue trying to get it to work.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169675,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Headset display issues (SteamVR error code 213)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/jyquf3\/headset_display_issues_steamvr_error_code_213\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":true,"author":"meijiJPN","author_created_utc":1502480644,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_a6c4fyn","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1605623955,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"jvu236","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_jvu236","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/jvu236\/how_to_fix_htc_vive_frame_stutteringpink_spikes\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623075015,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I've had this issue and fixed it multiple times.

Originally I had intended to get an index, but the quest 2 was there, cheap, and had a good no questions return policy if it sucked. So I thought, hey, just for lols, why don't I see if a $300 HMD can beat HTC's $700 Cosmos. \n\nTL;DR I'm not buying an Index anymore and I'm yeeting the Cosmos to the trash whence it belongs (and never buying HTC again). **The Quest 2 is less than half the price and all around better than the Cosmos.**\n\nHere are my observations after 2 weeks of daily play.\n\n## Cost\n\nBear this in mind as you read my review. \n\nThe Cosmos cost $700 for the wired base unit. A wireless adapter would add another $300-$400 making a wireless Cosmos (with inside-out tracking) cost over $1000\n\nThe Quest 2 costs $300 BUT in reality you **will** want to get virtual desktop for $20 (devs gotta get paid for doing the Lord's work), and some comfort mods like a new strap and fit kit for $50-$100. So, in practical terms, butget $420 for the Quest 2. If you have an OG vive, then you can transfer the strap easily with a bit of ghetto work and have a much more comfortable experience. **You will NOT need to get the expanded storage version of the Quest 2**\n\n## Tracking\n\nHoly hot dicks from hellm, Batman. The difference is night and day. \n\n**With the Cosmos**, the (idiotic) use of visible light tracking meant that I could only play during certain times of day when it wasn't too bright or too dark outside and, even when the Cosmos was happy about the ambient light levels, 50% of the time I'd end up quitting games like Beatsaber out of sheer frustration with the Cosmos' controller tracking stuttering, drifting, or just totally freaking out - the latter especially during fast songs that involved right-left crossovers or hitting high up targets.  \n\n**With the Quest** I have only lost tracking ONCE when I forgot that I was using inside out tracking and tried to pull a manuver with one hand behind my back. Still not as good as outside in tracking, but DAMN it actually feels good. Expert level songs on beatsaber that were impossible on the Cosmos I can now reliably get through with an A grade (and even gort my first expert S-grade!) - really the handicap of the cosmos was absurd! And gun games like AZ Sunshine are actually playable! I suspect my accuracy would still be better on the Index, but dang, playable vs not makes a difference! \n\n## Display\n\nThis depends on whether you prefer **crispness &amp; clarity (quest)** or **color depth &amp; vibrance (cosmos)**. For me, the Quest's wider sweet spot (unless you have really non-standard IPC) combined with the higher resolution makes a big difference, although that comes at the cost of the Cosmos' deeper blacks and better low-light contrast. The Quest's higher resolution, however, makes reading text and even using the virtual desktop MUCH nicer. It's still not good enough to be used as a monitor replacement (honestly, no HMD is close to that right now), but it is like a breath of fresh air for my  eyes overall. \n\nOf note is that the Quest 2 does have more light leakage. I'm pretty sure Oculus is selling the HMD at close to coset and expecting to make up the revenue by selling things like their $40 fit kit, which is a bit annoying. It's not too bad, however, and I'm content to wait for a third party to make a $15 alternative. \n\n## Battery Life\n\nThis is honestly a bit of a wash but a **slight edge to the Quest**. Where the Cosmos' 2 controller batteries will be flat after 2 hours (and performance dipping after 60-90 minutes), the Quest's single controller batteries are still showing 100-freaking-percent after 2 weeks. To me this underscores how stupidly the engineering team at HTC were managed. Worse tracking and massivelly worse battery life than simple IR yet they pushed ahead with it anyway? Ack. \n\nNow, obviously the flipside is that the Quest's HMD has it's own 2 hour battery life to contend with, but charging one thing rather than 4 AA batteries inbetween usages is a quality of life benefit to me. \n\n## Pick up and play\n\n**Huge win for the Quest here.** With the Cosmos I had to bring out the cable, take the 4 AA batteries out of the charger and put them in controllers, then turn it on and close out HTC's bloatware that always seemed to want to take the spotlight from Steam VR. With the Quest 2, I just unplug the USB charger and put it on. Heck, if I'm playing a game that's on the HMD itself, I don't even need to turn my computer on. \n\n## Latency (i.e. wireless virtual desktop)\n\nI've mentioned virtual desktop, thje $20 app that IMO you will need to buy to really get the most of the Quest 2. Obviously, playing wirelessly introduces some latency, however the good news is that with a good-enough 5Ghz AC or AX router, it's not actually all that noticable in fast games like Beatsaber (where the better tracking MORE than makes up for it) and in normal paced games I can't notice it at all! I haven't used HTC's expensive wireless adapter, so can't really compare, however I suspect HTC's solution should give less lag (especially since it costs as much as a Quest 2!).\n\nWhere lag does happen, it tends to be when it's hot (I live in socal) and my AC (not AX) router is possible thermally throttling? It's usually minor, like a split second stutter but this is far less frequent that the Cosmos' tracking issues and tends to be less intrusive than seeing your left hand drift off into the distance while everything else is still coming at you. \n\n### Wifi-6? \n\nOut of curiosity I tried running an access point using Huawei's $70 wifi 6 router. TBH while average latency was lower, the variance was higher causing more stutters. I returned the router and just run it from a 5Ghz chanel on my existing router and that works fine. I suspect a decent AC router simply has better processing power than a cheap AX router does. I'm not sure how Virtual desktop would run on a cheap AC router. \nDo you need to buy a new router? Possibly if you have some ISP-provided junker or a 2.4ghz router, so factor that into the cost of the Quest. Of course, getting a better router will give you other benefits outside of VR, so even a $300 Quest 2 + a better $200 router would be a much better package than a Cosmos alone. I plan to get a good wifi 6 router on black friday if there is a good deal. If not, eh, I'll just stick with my current one which is working fine.  \n\n## The Oculus store\n\nThis one is interesting. Unlike HTC's store, which I never used because Steam seemed to always have better prices and more convienient content management, I have acutally used the Oculus store since is obviously not as good as Steam, but you can use both - get games that you want to have max graphica like AZ Sunshine on Steam and play via virtual desktop. Games with low graphical requirements that you want minimum latency and maximum portablility (e.g. Pistolwhip) on the Oculus store. Sure it sucks that you can't sideload your Steam library, but for obvious reasons a fully loaded x86 game wouldn't exactly play will on the Quest 2 even if you could! \n\nThat being said, Quest native games have much loser graphics than games you can play over virtual desktop and they don't seem to offer cross play between consoles, so I plan to have a few games on the Quest 2 and play everything else via virtual desktop. \n\n## Portability\n\nWireless Quest 2 that can (optionally) house its game library independent of a computer or a wired HMD that needs to be connected to a powerful PC. Need I say more? \n\n## Comfort\n\nThis is where the stock Cosmos beats the stock Quest 2. The Quest 2's stock strap is functional, and a nice option for portability (I mean, you can put the whole kit in a small backpack!) but for daily and extended plays it's worrth either inesting in a \"franken quest\" setup or getting one of the enhances straps for $40-$50 (there are now third party ones on Amazon). \n\n**Without the Frankenquest mod** It's say the lighter weight and wirelessness of the Quest makes up for the dainty strap, so it's a bit of a wash. \n\n**With the Frankenquest mod** The Quest 2's lightness and lack of a cable make it far more comfortable, even with the stock fit kit. \n\nOne lingering thing, though is that for sharing the Quest 2's cushon material is prone to asorb all of you face juices, so, if you intend to share it around, get a $10 silicone cover from Amazon.\n\n\n## Zuckerberg's Voyueristic Tendencies. \n\nPerhaps it's no surprise that after getting brought by Facebook, Oculus' tracking technology got eerily good. Having to connect to your facebook account (or jailbreak the bastard) is a downer, and you'll need to consider if you're okay with some Facebook analyst watching you fap to VR porno if that's your thing. Personally, I'm not so bothered, and with GDPR you can always go Karen mode and demand that they delete all of your data when you're ready to move on. Note that doing so will remove your purchases in the Oculus store, so, again, virtual desktop is the way to go. And, hey, if VR porn is your thing, I'm pretty sure the HP Reverb's higher resolution + lack of a Facebook worker watching you from the corner of the room should be a consideration for you. \n\nFor sharability, there is some screwy stuff with Quest's account schenanegans but remember, if you want to have a VR party you could just buy two Quest 2 units for the price of a single Cosmos. If you want to go wireless, you could get three! \n\n## Conclusions\n\nAfter getting the Quest 2, I packed up my Cosmos - I have literally no use for it now. Maybe I'll sell it to someone who has a Cosmos elite and wants the controllers and faceplate for an inside-out option? IDK. But where the Cosmos make me stop playing VR and left me with a lot of disappointment, the Quest has me enjoying VR again and I don't constantly feel ripped off and lied to, which, if you get the Cosmos, believe me, you will feel ripped off and lied to. HTC's unit costs over twice the price ($320 for the Quest 2 + virtual desktop) for a wired VR experience with dismal tracking that literally depends on ambient light conditions. If you spend a little more on some comfort mods, there is no contest. The Quest 2 is a light weight and convienient way to play games and optionally fap in from of Mark Zuckerberg's lustful gaze.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169662,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Review: HTC Cosmos vs Oculus Quest 2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.84,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/jpy9dy\/review_htc_cosmos_vs_oculus_quest_2\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}],"metadata":{"op_a":157,"op_b":107,"total":264},"error":null}
