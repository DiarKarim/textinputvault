I have been trying to fix those issues for years and even recently, I spent about a year and a half with the Vive support team, trying absolutely everything to get this resolved. With their immense help, I was able to compile this extensive list of troubleshooting tests \/ fixes. Huge shoutout to William from Vive for helping with this issue for over a year!

Of course, it\u2019s ridiculous to compare the number of flatscreen games with VR titles because it's still a relatively small niche. However, I personally think it's a bit of a stretch to say there aren't enough games in VR, which is why I decided to make a post of the games I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with and the games I\u2019m planning to play in the months to come to hopefully help those who are looking for something new. Granted, it does depend on the type of a gamer you are because some are able to pour much more time than others, and perhaps they go through games much quicker. But overall, I would say the market is quite decent.\r  \n\r  \nI usually have 2 to 3 hours available for gaming each day, so keep in mind that I\u2019m not a \u201chardcore\u201d gamer by the usual standards. It\u2019s also worth noting that the listed games aren\u2019t all of the games from my collection, just the ones I\u2019ve had most fun playing, and would wholeheartedly recommend. Still, you may find some of the titles I\u2019d consider WOW remarkably boring, and that\u2019s okay. We all have our own preferences when it comes to games, food, and spaceships.\r  \n\r  \nLet\u2019s start with the games:\r  \n\r  \n**Half-Life: Alyx** \\- One of my favorite games. A wonderful blend of great storytelling and action, with beautiful graphics, sound, and intuitive gameplay mechanics.\r  \n\r  \n**Skyrim VR** \\- An RPG that probably found its way into every serious gamer's library. It's a great game that found new life inside VR. Beautiful, immersive and charming.\r  \n\r  \n**Into the Radius** \\- My current favorite FPS game. A sleeper hit that I bought thanks to Reddit, after reading many great things about it. Truly unique atmosphere, great sound design, and gunplay that is simply amazing. Attention to detail when it comes to weapons is astonishing.\r  \n\r  \n**Subnautica** \\- Wonderful underwater adventure. It is both scary and mesmerizing, set in a distinct world and it has a great atmosphere. It's a really enjoyable experience on many levels.\r  \n\r  \n**Horror Bar VR** \\- Spooky cooking sim. For those moments when you just wanna relax and have fun. Original concept, goofy graphics, and hilarious monsters. Serving all sorts of disgusting things to them so they can munch is more interesting than it might sound.\r  \n\r  \n**Asseto Corsa** \\- My favorite racing sim. When it comes to immersion, realism and looks, this game takes the crown in a world of driving simulations. It is challenging, beautiful and extremely fun to play.\r  \n\r  \n**MS Flight Simulator** \\- Most realistic flight sim I played. I'm aware there is a lifelong debate about which flight sim is the best. Personally, I consider MS Flight Simulator to be the clear winner. It is an experience that is tough to match, at least for all flight and aviation enthusiasts.\r  \n\r  \n**Bartender VR Simulator** \\- Realistic cocktail making sim. Mixing virtual drinks in some beautiful looking bars, all while listening to chill music is quite a stress relief. Challenging and rewarding for anyone who's into cocktails and the skill needed to fix them properly.\r  \n\r  \n**BeatSaber** \\- First person rhythmic workout. Honestly, I don't know how else to describe it. It is fun, hectic and physically demanding. Pleasure and work for all the senses.\r  \n\r  \n**Among Us** \\- Imposter! Easy to play but not easy to describe. One of the most fun casual games to play against other people. Laughter is guaranteed, but it does come with some infuriating moments.\r  \n\r  \n**Eleven Table Tennis** \\- Super chill sports sim. I love table tennis in RL, so the VR version was a no-brainer for me. Decent physics, fun to play, and addictive.\r  \n\r  \n**Walkabout Mini Golf** \\- Lovely golf sim. I just love this one. I love anything related to golf, and even though this is not your PGA Tour for VR, it is a blast to play. It\u2019s also very relaxing and pleasant to play.\r  \n\r  \n**Star Wars: Squadrons** \\- It's a Star Wars game! For me, that alone is enough because I'm a huge fan of anything related to Star Wars, but in all seriousness, it is a great game. Piloting iconic fighters from one of my favorite universes is a very special experience.\r  \n\r  \nApart from the list of the games I\u2019ve played, there\u2019s also a list of the games I\u2019ve been planning on buying in the next couple of months.

Of course, it\u2019s ridiculous to compare the number of flatscreen games with VR titles because it&amp;#39;s still a relatively small niche. However, I personally think it&amp;#39;s a bit of a stretch to say there aren&amp;#39;t enough games in VR, which is why I decided to make a post of the games I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with and the games I\u2019m planning to play in the months to come to hopefully help those who are looking for something new. Granted, it does depend on the type of a gamer you are because some are able to pour much more time than others, and perhaps they go through games much quicker. But overall, I would say the market is quite decent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually have 2 to 3 hours available for gaming each day, so keep in mind that I\u2019m not a \u201chardcore\u201d gamer by the usual standards. It\u2019s also worth noting that the listed games aren\u2019t all of the games from my collection, just the ones I\u2019ve had most fun playing, and would wholeheartedly recommend. Still, you may find some of the titles I\u2019d consider WOW remarkably boring, and that\u2019s okay. We all have our own preferences when it comes to games, food, and spaceships.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s start with the games:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;\/strong&gt; - One of my favorite games. A wonderful blend of great storytelling and action, with beautiful graphics, sound, and intuitive gameplay mechanics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skyrim VR&lt;\/strong&gt; - An RPG that probably found its way into every serious gamer&amp;#39;s library. It&amp;#39;s a great game that found new life inside VR. Beautiful, immersive and charming.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the Radius&lt;\/strong&gt; - My current favorite FPS game. A sleeper hit that I bought thanks to Reddit, after reading many great things about it. Truly unique atmosphere, great sound design, and gunplay that is simply amazing. Attention to detail when it comes to weapons is astonishing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subnautica&lt;\/strong&gt; - Wonderful underwater adventure. It is both scary and mesmerizing, set in a distinct world and it has a great atmosphere. It&amp;#39;s a really enjoyable experience on many levels.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horror Bar VR&lt;\/strong&gt; - Spooky cooking sim. For those moments when you just wanna relax and have fun. Original concept, goofy graphics, and hilarious monsters. Serving all sorts of disgusting things to them so they can munch is more interesting than it might sound.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asseto Corsa&lt;\/strong&gt; - My favorite racing sim. When it comes to immersion, realism and looks, this game takes the crown in a world of driving simulations. It is challenging, beautiful and extremely fun to play.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS Flight Simulator&lt;\/strong&gt; - Most realistic flight sim I played. I&amp;#39;m aware there is a lifelong debate about which flight sim is the best. Personally, I consider MS Flight Simulator to be the clear winner. It is an experience that is tough to match, at least for all flight and aviation enthusiasts.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bartender VR Simulator&lt;\/strong&gt; - Realistic cocktail making sim. Mixing virtual drinks in some beautiful looking bars, all while listening to chill music is quite a stress relief. Challenging and rewarding for anyone who&amp;#39;s into cocktails and the skill needed to fix them properly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BeatSaber&lt;\/strong&gt; - First person rhythmic workout. Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t know how else to describe it. It is fun, hectic and physically demanding. Pleasure and work for all the senses.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Among Us&lt;\/strong&gt; - Imposter! Easy to play but not easy to describe. One of the most fun casual games to play against other people. Laughter is guaranteed, but it does come with some infuriating moments.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eleven Table Tennis&lt;\/strong&gt; - Super chill sports sim. I love table tennis in RL, so the VR version was a no-brainer for me. Decent physics, fun to play, and addictive.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walkabout Mini Golf&lt;\/strong&gt; - Lovely golf sim. I just love this one. I love anything related to golf, and even though this is not your PGA Tour for VR, it is a blast to play. It\u2019s also very relaxing and pleasant to play.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;\/strong&gt; - It&amp;#39;s a Star Wars game! For me, that alone is enough because I&amp;#39;m a huge fan of anything related to Star Wars, but in all seriousness, it is a great game. Piloting iconic fighters from one of my favorite universes is a very special experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from the list of the games I\u2019ve played, there\u2019s also a list of the games I\u2019ve been planning on buying in the next couple of months. Some of them are already launched, some are still in works, but imo all of them are worth checking out.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshop Simulator&lt;\/strong&gt; - Because I love those kinds of games. Going by Jung, I&amp;#39;m definitely a thinker, but working with my hands relaxes me a lot, and that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m looking forward to this game&amp;#39;s launch.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I expect you to die 1 &amp;amp; 2&lt;\/strong&gt; - Because I heard so many great things about it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Man&amp;#39;s Sky&lt;\/strong&gt; - For the same reason as the game above.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superhot VR&lt;\/strong&gt; - Because apparently, it&amp;#39;s a must have, and I wanna see why so many people speak positively of it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, I\u2019ve taken into consideration the fact that different people can have widely different tastes in video games when writing this post and did my best to include different types of games to match everyone\u2019s preferences.

I think it is quite resolvable unless a person truly has faulty hardware.\n\nMy wireless experience is now amazing and hoping some of my tips my help others with wireless issue.\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n\nCheck for the obvious off first:\n\n1. Update MB, VR hardware etc. firmware\/bios.\n2. Update GPU, VR, MB hardware drivers.\n\n[fpsVR](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/908520\/fpsVR\/) is good at helping determine in real time GPU or CPU frame timings.  (or other free options)\n\n**A) CPU frame times:**\n\n[CPU Frametime example issue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/swMrOwv)\n\nCPU frame time issues are a much larger issue compared to GPU frame issues.  If your game is getting constant CPU frame time spikes either your CPU is underpowered, has RAM speed (maybe XMP not enabled), or weird P\/E core issues.  If your CPU often spikes frame time then no amount of GPU will help you get a smooth VR experience (and some games are worse offenders than others:  FO4VR (single core), SkyrimVR and DCS etc.)\n\nB) **GPU frame time issues:**\n\n[GPU Frametime example issue](https:\/\/imgur.com\/PCNPU8H)\n\nGood news here is that you have options.  Drop GPU in game settings.  Drop rendering resolutions etc.  Anytime you can make your GPU render fast enough to prevent GPU frame time over your headset refresh rate zone (or to a point that you can live with it).  First dial settings down, then add back after all other issues are resolved.\n\nC) **Marching of the dreaded purple line on GPU frame time chart or what feels like a micro stutter:**\n\n[Example Purple Line on GPU Frametime Chart](https:\/\/imgur.com\/KEbwxTm)\n\nOften caused by background monitoring processes like Corsair (suxs), MSI etc.   You can write a .bat script that can be run before each VR session.  Kill all unnecessary processes.  Locate by looking at TaskManager &gt; Details &gt; Sort by CPU or Memory usage.  Read up dont kill stop critical MS OS processes.  Some processes be so embedded that it's best to uninstall them altogether.\n\ntaskkill \/IM \"exact\\_exe\\_name.exe\" \/F\n\nEx: taskkill \/IM \"WhatsApp.exe\" \/F\n\nStop all unnecessary services.  Locate by looking at TaskManager &gt; Services  &gt; Sort by Status and look for Running.  Read up dont kill stop critical MS OS services.\n\nnet stop \"exact service name\"\n\nEx: net stop \"ROG Live Service\"\n\nPurple lines are normal during major CPU\/HDD tasks like game start or major texture loading.  However, once your game is up or new areas loaded you should NEVER see them, if not you have a symptom of a larger underlying problem.\n\n[Here is an example of a \"good\" purple line during loading of an area](https:\/\/imgur.com\/En5R7wA)\n\nD) **Intel WiGig Wireless issue:  Streaming image in headset \u201cblurry\u201d or \u201cpixelated\u201d either main game or even SteamVR home**\n\nNot enough CPU allocated either SteamVR processes or Intel WiGig process:\n\n1. vrcompositor.exe\n2. vrserver.exe\n3. HtcConnectionUtility.exe\n\nThere is a chance if you are running P and E cores that some of your SteamVR process are running on an E core.  My 13900KS did just that!  You could either try hinting your VR processes to force use P cores or brute force disabling all E cores and see if issue persist.  As P\/E core technology matures hopefully this will become less of an issue.  But I can 100% attest that my random \u201cblurry\/picilabed\u201d vr image stream issue was resolved by ensuring that all my steam VR process and game run on P cores only.\n\nIf you are running an old CPU and depending on game -- you may not be able to resolve this at all.\n\nYou could also set the priority of all your important SteamVR, game and Intel WiGig process, I don\u2019t recommend using \u201cRealtime\u201d ever.  \u201cHigh\u201d is as high as I would go.\n\n**Example:**\n\n*wmic process where name=\"vrcompositor.exe\" CALL setpriority \"high priority\"*\n\n*timeout 1 &gt; NUL*\n\n*wmic process where name=\"vrserver.exe\" CALL setpriority \"high priority\"*\n\n*timeout 1 &gt; NUL*\n\n*wmic process where name=\"vrmonitor.exe\" CALL setpriority \"high priority\"*\n\n*timeout 1 &gt; NULwmic process where name=\"Fallout4VR.exe\" CALL setpriority \"high priority\"*\n\n*timeout 1 &gt; NUL*\n\nBut don\u2019t mess with CPU **affinity** setting IMO just let the OS do its thing, else you may end up with CPU core overallocated.\n\n**E) Vive-pro headset blue or grey screen:**\n\nGet the obvious out the way, make sure decent line of sight from camera to wireless headpiece.  Much less of an issue IMO also you can clearly see your signal strength.   You could also try different channels, but that too is not major impact.\n\n**Actual Intel WiGig card Temperture** is the number 1 cause in my opinion.  I placed my card right over a fresh air intake fan and ran fans at max and have not had a single headset blue screen since.  **I am tempted to add a fixed fan connected to the MB header as a permanent measure.**  This card is passively cooled, so if your case gets hot inside you can run into blue\/grey screen issues.\n\n[Example card placement in my pc case](https:\/\/imgur.com\/uDL2s5A)  Apologies had all my RGB crp turned off.\n\n**A well known heat issue is the Vive wireless headset unit:**  Easily fixed by googling and buy headset fan mod.   Vive wireless logs will show if you have this issue, normally you will get blue\/grey screen crashes after 80c \u2026 if you are running around 45-50c you are probably fine.\n\n[Vive Wireless Headset Fan Link](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B071JB9WYB\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\n[3D Print Mold Link](https:\/\/cults3d.com\/en\/3d-model\/gadget\/vive-wireless-fan-holder-og-vive)\n\nIf you have fpsVR there is a checkbox to allow showing real time wireless adapter temp too.\n\n**Ensure your WiGig process never loses power**\n\nYou can locate the physical card and ensure Windows never cut its power.\n\nDevice Manager &gt; View &gt; Devices by Connection Type &gt; System Devices\n\n[Example Link](https:\/\/imgur.com\/SparNEP)  for example in my case, all under 7A3C you change the power setting to\n\n[Uncheck - Allow the comp. to turn off device power](https:\/\/imgur.com\/DeN97QW)\n\nUncheck above box for all subs\n\n**Ensure SteamVR never turn off power to VR related USB devices**\n\n[SteamVR Developer Disable Power Management](https:\/\/imgur.com\/HkGHTUv)\n\nLoose USB connection between battery pack and wireless head piece.  Probably less of a cause but can easily get a USB 3.0 replacement cable with better shielding.\n\n[USB Cable option](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B088GG7YQR?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)  \\-- not needed IMO\n\nLength of coaxial cable from WiGig card to wireless sensor camera.  Mixed feelings about this.  I extended mine by about 3\u2019 \u2026 I have zero issues, but increasing the distance could add to image qualify issues.  If your troubleshooting remove it from your loop.\n\n[Example of extension cable Link](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B071Y7FXWW\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)\n\nReplacement battery pack.  If the power is clean, you should be fine.  I don't suggest using 3rd party battery packs.  Use original when troubleshooting.\n\nI firmly believe the Intel WiGig card and Vive Wireless adapter heat are the biggest culprits to blue\/grey screens.\n\n**F) Weird perceived in game lag, latencies or what feels like missed frames but without purple line on.**\n\nDo not change or add artificial FPS caps either using vsync, or MSI or Steam command line hints etc.  One may mistakenly think that for example if your headset is 90Hz that artificially capping your FPS at 90 may be beneficial to remove additional wireless load -- But you actually adding problems with timings that maybe wont even show in fpsVR.  Remove caps and aim for max fps.\n\n**G) My thoughts on overlocking:**\n\nSome posts argue that overclocking, or RAM XMP can be RC for blue screens.  My view is that if you overclock and RAM tests are stable, you should not worry about it as you need all the CPU\/RAM speed you can get for good VR.\n\n**H) Re-projection**\n\nI get a bit more reprojection with wireless compared to tethered with cable, but since it adds no latency to my gameplay (that I can tell), it does not bother me.   OVR will show your stats.  Keep an eye on reprojection and dropped frames.  Reprojection is close to non-issue imo.\n\n**I) Other tools**\n\n[latencymon](https:\/\/www.resplendence.com\/latencymon) \\-- somewhat useful to see if you have driver latencies\n\n**J) My Hardware**\n\nRecently upgraded and built new PC, from 9900KS\/3090 to 13900KS\/4090 (water-cooled).  VR:  VivePro (set to 150% rendering with lens mod and vive wireless.  Still using old OG Vive lighthouses, Index knuckle controllers and sometimes old Vive wands.  I have tried other VR headsets, but OLED, lens mod (clear) and total freedom of wireless to me are subjectively better.  I don\u2019t like the SDE I get, but can't give up wireless and lens mod and OLED.\n\n**VR games I enjoy:** Mostly FO4VR and SkyrimVR [Current 13900ks\/4090 VR play space and setup](https:\/\/imgur.com\/e7Js8iU)\n\n**Pancake Games:** 1400p x3 screens DCS, E:D etc.  [My old 9900ks\/3080 setup flight sim](https:\/\/imgur.com\/J3hpTHi)\n\n**What \"good times\" in FO4VR can look like:**\n\nLooks for frame times and temperatures, Vive Wireless temp. at very bottom.\n\n[Diamond City loading in image](https:\/\/imgur.com\/yZY1nVl)\n\n[Diamond City After Load In](https:\/\/imgur.com\/LLXlBUa)\n\n[Rain and other effects ongoing](https:\/\/imgur.com\/HaWGEbK)\n\n[Signal](https:\/\/imgur.com\/WWNICLh)\n\nHope this helps someone, took me some time to put this all down!","author_fullname":"t2_u77yh","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Vive Wireless Troubleshooting Tips (blue screens\/dropped frames\/latencies) [RESOLVED]","link_flair_richtext":[],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"mediainfo 908520 steampowered gm automod","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_13wrh80","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.83,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":19,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":null,"can_mod_post":false,"score":19,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":1685561494.0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1685551749.0,"link_flair_type":"text","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.Vive","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to give back to the community as a thank you for all the people modifying games like FO4VR\/SkyrimVR that I love so much.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded my system and ran into some typical Vive Wireless and other common VR issues.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like many I got frustrated with blue screen issues.

I placed my card right over a fresh air intake fan and ran fans at max and have not had a single headset blue screen since.  &lt;strong&gt;I am tempted to add a fixed fan connected to the MB header as a permanent measure.&lt;\/strong&gt;  This card is passively cooled, so if your case gets hot inside you can run into blue\/grey screen issues.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/uDL2s5A\"&gt;Example card placement in my pc case&lt;\/a&gt;  Apologies had all my RGB crp turned off.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A well known heat issue is the Vive wireless headset unit:&lt;\/strong&gt;  Easily fixed by googling and buy headset fan mod.   Vive wireless logs will show if you have this issue, normally you will get blue\/grey screen crashes after 80c \u2026 if you are running around 45-50c you are probably fine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B071JB9WYB\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1\"&gt;Vive Wireless Headset Fan Link&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/cults3d.com\/en\/3d-model\/gadget\/vive-wireless-fan-holder-og-vive\"&gt;3D Print Mold Link&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have fpsVR there is a checkbox to allow showing real time wireless adapter temp too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure your WiGig process never loses power&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can locate the physical card and ensure Windows never cut its power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Device Manager &amp;gt; View &amp;gt; Devices by Connection Type &amp;gt; System Devices&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/SparNEP\"&gt;Example Link&lt;\/a&gt;  for example in my case, all under 7A3C you change the power setting to&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/DeN97QW\"&gt;Uncheck - Allow the comp. to turn off device power&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uncheck above box for all subs&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure SteamVR never turn off power to VR related USB devices&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/imgur.com\/HkGHTUv\"&gt;SteamVR Developer Disable Power Management&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Loose USB connection between battery pack and wireless head piece.

Mixed feelings about this.  I extended mine by about 3\u2019 \u2026 I have zero issues, but increasing the distance could add to image qualify issues.  If your troubleshooting remove it from your loop.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B071Y7FXWW\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1\"&gt;Example of extension cable Link&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Replacement battery pack.  If the power is clean, you should be fine.  I don&amp;#39;t suggest using 3rd party battery packs.  Use original when troubleshooting.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe the Intel WiGig card and Vive Wireless adapter heat are the biggest culprits to blue\/grey screens.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F) Weird perceived in game lag, latencies or what feels like missed frames but without purple line on.&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do not change or add artificial FPS caps either using vsync, or MSI or Steam command line hints etc.  One may mistakenly think that for example if your headset is 90Hz that artificially capping your FPS at 90 may be beneficial to remove additional wireless load -- But you actually adding problems with timings that maybe wont even show in fpsVR.  Remove caps and aim for max fps.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G) My thoughts on overlocking:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some posts argue that overclocking, or RAM XMP can be RC for blue screens.  My view is that if you overclock and RAM tests are stable, you should not worry about it as you need all the CPU\/RAM speed you can get for good VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H) Re-projection&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get a bit more reprojection with wireless compared to tethered with cable, but since it adds no latency to my gameplay (that I can tell), it does not bother me.   OVR will show your stats.  Keep an eye on reprojection and dropped frames.  Reprojection is close to non-issue imo.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I) Other tools&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.resplendence.com\/latencymon\"&gt;latencymon&lt;\/a&gt; -- somewhat useful to see if you have driver latencies&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J) My Hardware&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recently upgraded and built new PC, from 9900KS\/3090 to 13900KS\/4090 (water-cooled).

I have tried other VR headsets, but OLED, lens mod (clear) and total freedom of wireless to me are subjectively better.

As soon as we received it, we installed, configured and calibrated using the OpenVR Space Calibrator to calibrate the trackers with the quest, however we noticed that there was A LOT of tracker drift. Doing a troubleshoting (testing each tracker, with each dongle and each base), everything works perfectly, however one of the base stations is causing infinite drift (we tested it only with it on, and we found that it caused it).   \nThe problem is that this base station has updated firmware, this one with its green status light, it is detected in steamVR, steamVR says that it has detected the trackers, but it has infinite drift... Is there any type of repair or different troubleshoting for to do?  \n \n\nAnother problem is that the SpaceFix of the OVR Advanced Settings does not work, we try to use only the functional base station (I know that a single base station makes the tracker bad, but not impossible to use), when she walks towards the base station on, it starts to go up as if going up a hill\/mountain, and if it walks in the opposite direction, it starts to go down. I figured this problem is the misconfigured playspace floor, so we used Space Fix's \"Fix Floor\" option in SteamVR, but it still hasn't fixed this problem.  \n\n\nNotes: I have tested many things as I have a vive tracker system myself with my Rift CV1. There is no reflective surface in her play area, the base stations are attached to the wall, above 2 meters, angled 30\\~45\u00b0 downwards, everything the way it should be.  \n   \n Anyway, thanks for reading this far and I welcome any opinions on what could be causing this.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177017,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Base station dead? and tracker problem, please help","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/11f99vm\/base_station_dead_and_tracker_problem_please_help\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[{"award_sub_type":"GLOBAL","award_type":"global","awardings_required_to_grant_benefits":null,"coin_price":500,"coin_reward":100,"count":1,"days_of_drip_extension":null,"days_of_premium":7,"description":"Gives 100 Reddit Coins and a week of r\/lounge access and ad-free browsing.","end_date":null,"giver_coin_reward":null,"icon_format":null,"icon_height":512,"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_512.png","icon_width":512,"id":"gid_2","is_enabled":true,"is_new":false,"name":"Gold","penny_donate":null,"penny_price":null,"resized_icons":[{"height":16,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_16.png","width":16},{"height":32,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_32.png","width":32},{"height":48,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_48.png","width":48},{"height":64,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_64.png","width":64},{"height":128,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_128.png","width":128}],"resized_static_icons":[{"height":16,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_16.png","width":16},{"height":32,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_32.png","width":32},{"height":48,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_48.png","width":48},{"height":64,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_64.png","width":64},{"height":128,"url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_128.png","width":128}],"start_date":null,"static_icon_height":512,"static_icon_url":"https:\/\/www.redditstatic.com\/gold\/awards\/icon\/gold_512.png","static_icon_width":512,"sticky_duration_seconds":null,"subreddit_coin_reward":0,"subreddit_id":null,"tiers_by_required_awardings":null}],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"CrysisAverted","author_created_utc":1335445516,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7k9we","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":true,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1677456362,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1677652813.0,"gilded":1,"gildings":{"gid_2":1},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"11cx8eg","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_11cx8eg","no_follow":false,"num_comments":78,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/11cx8eg\/vive_xr_elite_first_impressions\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678312375,"score":46,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"OK my wife i just got our vive xr elite headsets in the mail. Very early initial impressions, i'll probably edit this with new info as i go.\n\n**Updates:**\n* 1\/03\/2023 - the free bundled apps are now appearing in the store, this includes ENGAGE, Unplugged air guitar and vive port video. Glimpse and Green Hell VR are still marked as Coming soon.\n* The new vive video app is really cool, its a video wall of curated content, such as asmr nature videos (low quality not 4k). There's also other video content that is locked behind a release wall so i can't try those out, but there's a yoga beach app that looks like it would be really neat, vr horror experience (IT chapter 2) again the video quality is pretty poor. There's gopro recorded footage, same thing videos aren't encoded high enough to really demonstrate the capabilities of the headset. Hopefully they recode things to much higher resolution.\n* ENGAGE is htc's metaverse from what i can tell. Not bad. I learned that i suck just as much dressing myself in avatar form as i do in IRL.\n\n* I've just figured out how to sideload android APK files using android platform tools. Here's what happens. If you load regular android apps in, eg Telegram etc they appear in a '2D content' filter in the apps area, opening these apps opens them on a flat surface for you to interact with. Not perfect but it seems to sort of work ok...\n\n---\n\n\n* This thing is SMALL. Compared to our OG vive or the hp reverb g2 it's half the size and weighs almost nothing.\n* The FOV seems less than my hp reverb with the mods, the facial insert is the issue here as bringing the eyes closer to the lenses improves things drastically.\n* The facial insert is... not great. the magnets aren't strong enough, the top is a hard plastic with not nearly enough foam padding so after taking it off your face, you still feel where it was pressing against your forehead. It does block out 95% of light (tiny bit of light leakage but it's fine). I'm really REALLY hoping there's an aftermarket facial insert because i've been very spoilt with the amazing products the customs community put together for the OG vive and my hp reverb, but i guess they necessitated a super comfy FI to offset the hefty weight on the head - which this doesn't have.\n   * Update! The top strap included in the box helps quite a bit, as it ensures the headset sits comfortably just sort of above the eyes where the sweet spot is for the lenses. It sits higher than older headsets, so this is something to get used to. The facial insert still isn't optimal, and sitting higher with the headstrap still can cause alot of light bleed around the edges. I'm sure this will get better going forward with more options.\n* The back battery comes off. I'm hoping there's a way to do steam vr passthrough or something to this via usb c... will investigate later.\n* Clarity is amazing though. The lenses are like nothing i've experienced before and i've been VRing since the DK1.\n* The phone setup app was simple and intuitive, ran me through wifi setup, account (you need a vive account for set up).\n* The controller pairing via bluetooth didn't work (my phone is a pixel 5), so i needed to connect them with the supplied usb type C cable to get them to connect. After that absolutely no problem.\n* Phone mirroring, requires miracast support on the phone to work, asked to enable some accessibility permissions and modify a system setting to enable vive manager to \"Allow modifying system settings\". After that it performed a quick check to ensure the phone was miracast compatible \"Your phone supports both miracast and HDCP 2.x\".\n* Then it displays some health and safety info and off you go!.\n* A system update via the phone was the first thing that happened next.\n* OK system update done, now it wants to adjust the diopters to make the image clearer... cool\n* OK the diopter setting is my first WOW moment: it enables passthrough camera at this stage and you can see your surroundings. It asks you to take off the facial insert and adjust one eye at a time. I'm wearing contact lenses and apparently my prescription isn't perfect as i need to set it to 1 for true clarity!\n* Diopter adjustment works by displaying a green cross in either eye (after blanking out the video from one eye), then you adjust the diopter until its clear\n* Next it made me reconnect the controllers... one controller again decided to not pair so i had to open the phone app and repair it manually. Annoying\n* Next is setting up the play space. This was amazing. I was first asked to 'push' the floor down to where my real floor is.\n* Then i was asked to trace my play space. I did this differently to my tethered experiences in the past given there's NO CABLES. So i traced from my study, out into the living room, a much larger play space than i'm used to. At this point passthrough was active, so i just walked back into my study with the headset still on to continue typing this post... with the headset still on... The VR boundaries glowing magically surrounding my real environment. Another wow moment.\n* OK So the passthrough, it's a bit weird. It's in colour but without depth, so there's some strange warping that goes on, like the image is being reconstructed and enhanced by an AI model rather than being a feed from the RGB camera, i believe this is how text clarity is being delivered, eg so you can read your phone. In fact i'm convinced this is what's happening, as the stability of the image can sometimes float around, some sort of ML model. Anyhow it's cool! And very useful.\n* OK Now I just set up a room that matches my physical room by placing objects in VR that match the dimensions of the real world, including tracing my desk, windows etc. Another wow moment.\n* PC desktop VR: OK so i have to install something on my PC for this to work.. getting there...\n* Disconnecting the battery pack at the back, you can plug in a usb cable to power it, or it has a tiny amount of juice to wear and operate for a short time. It's far from comfortable though, it really does require the back head strap with the battery to counter-weight and to keep in the right position. I guess you could use it in this mode if laying on a couch connected with a macbook cable or something and watch a movie laying down. The annoying thing here is that the ergonomics aren't designed for this mode clearly, the 'arms' grip your head a bit further up than what is ideal, so they don't really sit on your ears like a pair of glasses. I'd call this mode a gimmick rather than something i'll likely use often.\n* Internal fan went a bit crazy at one point, now the battery is drained so charging up.\n* Managed to connect the headset without the battery cradle to a macbook charger via usb C so i can use it while the battery is charging. Has to be via the usb C cable, won't work via a usb 2 cable. Needs 30w to run this way.\n* Finger tracking is really good. The gestures feel natural and accurate. Pinch to select stuff, or to scroll lists.\n* Phone mirroring isn't working for me yet, the manual connection instructions say the vive xr elite will be identified as \"ViveFocus3\\_\\[my device id\\]\"... that's clearly not right.\n* Was able to cast the VR view onto my phone, guessing you could use that to cast your VR view to a TV so others can see what you're doing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SteamVR \/ Desktop Streaming:**\n\nWired: This works VERY well. I'm highly impressed, this is probably how i'll do all my desktop VR gaming, keeping the wireless for when it's really needed.\n\nWireless:\n\n* You'll need wifi 5 or 6 for this to work apparently. And apparently our network supports that. Yay.\n* I initially had sketchy reception streaming from a PC far away from me. My fix that might help others: If you have a wifi network that has satellite base stations for increasing range, put one ON your PC and connect it via ethernet so that your PC is connected directly to your router via the dedicated backbone which tends to be a higher bitrate and prioritised packet delivery. This has made streaming performance acceptable for me.\n* In the Vive Streaming Hub i turned the bitrate up to 200Mbps to improve the visuals and turned the quality settings up to Ultra. Without doing that it was mediocre quality.\n* Tried using hand tracking in steamVR but the hand models were not orientated properly and seemed to be off by about 45 degrees in the X axis.\n* Using controllers didn't have the model orientation issue. Perfect tracking.\n* The vive turned up as an audio device once the streaming hub was installed, setting my windows audio device output to the vive sent it streaming to my headset.\n* I'm not noticing any significant latency, but this will really depend on your network, your router's capabilities and having nothing else at all happening on your network. Once my wife and I start vrchatting at the same time im guessing the performance will tank somewhat as more packets get thrown around the network.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Wierd Bugs\/Glitches:**\n\n* Hand tracking seems CPU intensive, will cause the fans to ramp up\n* If you move to another location, eg lay down on a couch or use headset in bed watching videos, you'll be presented with \"boundary tracking lost\", which then makes you REDO the entire boundary setup from scratch before you can use it. There is no way to cancel this, although you can go through the standing setup to get through it quicker... HOWEVER:\n* If you take the headset off, while in bed\/on a couch etc, then put it back on You'll immediately get the boundary lost message again and have to REDO the entire set up again. Every single time.\n* HTC: Please give the option to just dismiss the boundary setup entirely and let us use it as a passive device given there are some circumstances where we will NOT be moving around at all.f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Other Suggestions:**\n\n* To switch into PC apps for streaming, you click a button up top that has an icon traditionally used for 'filter', eg 'order by popular' etc. Then in there you select PC and it changes to view to enumerate titles from the streaming server you have set up. This should just be a dedicated button up the top in my opinion, not hidden away in a menu. If there were \"Standalone | Streaming\" Buttons at the top, id be happy.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177213,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive XR Elite First Impressions","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/11cx8eg\/vive_xr_elite_first_impressions\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Level-Gazelle7708","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"new","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"4f9d5e8a-6c37-11e9-b35f-122677b24742","author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_8qpmiq0h","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1676028489,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10ypn77","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10ypn77","no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/10ypn77\/vive_face_facial_tracker_problems_solved_error\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678333403,"score":10,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I had alot of problems with my face tracker in the last few weeks and after talking with the constumer support from vive i kinda decided to share my knowledge.

The main differences between the \"Wireless Adapter Full Pack\" (new) and the \"Wireless Adapter for VIVE\" (original) are a different cable for the headset side and different cradles. The PCIe card, adapter, antenna + mounting hardware, battery (slightly larger capacity in the new kit) and holder are the same.\n\nI have an original VIVE and recently purchased the Wireless Adapter Full Pack which doesn't contain the short 3-in-1 cable or the cradle. The long 3-in-1 cable that comes with the VIVE *does* work, but obviously it isn't ideal because it's heavy with all that extra length. Originally both of these could be purchased from iFixit ([cradle](https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Store\/Generic\/HTC-Vive-Wireless-Adapter-Clip-and-Screws\/IF453-034?o=1) and [cable](https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Store\/Generic\/HTC-Vive-Wireless-Adapter-Short-3-In-1-Cable\/IF453-024?o=1)), but HTC is no longer selling them to iFixit since the original VIVE discontinued. There's some cradle stock left, but no cable stock.\n\nTL;DR does anyone know where to get a short 3-in-1 cable online now that the cable has been discontinued from HTC? There are a few on [eBay](https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/294840368558), but the prices are a bit ridiculous. Alternatively, has anyone tested short 3rd party replacement cables?\n\nEDIT: I ended up with some cables that seem to work decently well. I wanted to try and source more name-brand stuff so it would at least be easy to find at other vendors, but that proved difficult. The HDMI is perfect; nice and short. The USB cable is more stiff than I'd like making it hard to close the cable compartment cover, but it's fine once you're wearing the headset. The power cable is nice and flexible, I'm pretty happy with it. Overall, it's about $34.45 CAD, which is better than the &gt;$100 CAD for the original cables on eBay.

There are a few more games needed to be added to the list (more keep being added as well) but they are currently downloading as the list was the biggest this time around, but sadly most disappointing (no 4.5+ or higher this time around).  Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.

I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.

It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177785,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/vc9x6s\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Sandsnake100","author_created_utc":1474840862,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_11nx84","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1653771701,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"uzw2p0","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_uzw2p0","no_follow":false,"num_comments":3,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/uzw2p0\/vive_tracker_not_connecting\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1653916083,"retrieved_utc":1653916083,"score":11,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I have 3 trackers, and two of them pair perfectly fine, but with one of them, the light turns green for a split second and then off.

I'm having issues mostly in Shapelab, but occasionally in VRChat too, with stuttering\/low frame rate movements. Today, Shapelab remained that way no matter what settings I changed. \n\nNot 3 days ago, I was able to use Shapelab with no issues. When I had logged in, it was choppy, but after I turned off a setting in Viveport's menu that is supposed to help render visual quality, it worked smoothly and with no problems.\n\nWhat is the issue here, do you think? The only other programs I have open on my computer are Chrome and a link to my cell phone. Is there a setting I can change to help with this? Or maybe some way to disable the fullscreen on-computer display and push things solely to my headset?

I bought the wireless kit for my vive pro 2, without thinking that it still requires a cabled connection to my PC.\n\nHere is my plan: extend this RM-SMA type cable with a 5 meters long one, with hopes that it's technically feasible. This way, the linkbox sensor will be able to be set in the gaming room, with about 7m total of coax cable till the WiGig card in my pc. However, I can't find any data sheet, specs or precise information on the type of camera the wireless linkbox is, its frequency, the cable's impedance, etc... This info is crucial to make sure I find the right cable and the right length.\n\nMy question(s) is therefore:\n\nWhere can I find this data I desperately need in order to make sure this plan works?

I have my Teamviewer 2nd office monitor or YouTube on this screen.\n\n\u2022 Above these 2 VR monitors is a window capturing my CCTV live feed - I can see who's coming to the door.\n\n\u2022 I have a window below, so when I look slightly downwards, my front-facing passthrough cameras fade into view and I can see my desk\/keyboard\/drink.\n\n\u2022 Finally I have a webcam capture behind me. So when I turn around to look at the door to my spare room\/mancave, I can see where my dogs are or if my wife wants to get my attention for a second, I can look at her lol.\n\nI couldn't do this with anything less than 5K as it will be too blurry and give a headache trying to read text all day.\n\nI take calls from customers, using the built-in mic and headphones, then using SIP software it defaults to the Vive Pro 2 for audio\/mic. They are oblivious that I'm actually working in VR.\n\nI think the most time I spent in VR was about 10 or 12 hours in 1 sitting. Going out for lunch to walk the dogs.\n\nYou have to be good at touch typing as you can't see your hands\/placement on the keyboard. I can do it, but I call it blind-typing as your cut-off from anything in your peripherals. This is where just the other day I thought about using the pass-through cameras to help find my drink on the desk lol.\n\nAs for comfort, it is a well-balanced HMD, but to help I replaced the foam face pads with Kiwi face pads and then a cotton face cover, it makes it feel very soft on the face.\n\nOh and the final touch, I have theBlu VR experience running behind, where the fish and turtles, rays swim all around me, it's very chill.\n\nImage of all my screens in VR and computer desktops = [https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912432763460804708\/unknown.png](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912432763460804708\/unknown.png)\n\ntheBlu (my background in VR) = [https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912452628435304528\/unknown.png](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/491621961370304516\/912452628435304528\/unknown.png)\n\nI have an android phone, using SideSync app on the PC and mobile, I can control\/swipe my phone and even take calls. I pair the mobile phone using VivePort and the bluetooth which is in the Vive linkbox, to then pair with the Vive Pro 2 headphones and mic.\n\nHere is a photo of my headset with the cotton pads on the ears and face...

Packaging \n\n The glasses were very well packaged, with recycled eco friendly materials and premium look and feel. As I unpacked the device, I realised that I didn't get the special preorder case (vive said it was out of stock and that it will be posted soon). \nThe package contained the glasses, USB type C cable (medium length), soft pouch,  a nose bridge and manuals.\n\n2. Initial setup\n\nSetup was pretty straight forward, as soon as I connected the glasses to the power supply, I saw a prompt to download vive app and follow the steps. My initial impressions of the screen at this stage were quite negative - it appeared blurry and out of focus. \n\nDuring the setup, the vive app prompted me to update the glasses which I agreed to, it took about 5 minutes. After that, I also had to agree and change different permissions and notification settings.\n\nThe vive app also did a quick check of my phone , and stated that it was generally compatible with the device except that my phone didn't support some protocols required to cast DRM protected content (more on that later).\n\nAfter the setup, initial intro video launched and I was advised to adjust diopter lenses and to take the facial interface off and to attach the nose bridge instead (both are magnetic and easy to attach and remove). This allows the glasses to rest on your nose very close to your eyes, and without the facial interface you can still see your surroundings which I found pretty cool. \n\nThen, the tutorial app displayed some lines in the left lense, and then in the right one and asked me to adjust the diopter dial slowly until lines are clear.\n\nLines appeared very smudgy and out of focus to me, especially on the right side. It looked very similar to Rift S, and I'm pretty sure it is due to my IPD of 70.\n\nI adjusted the lenses to something like 1 on the left lense and 3 on the right one, the display immediately looked much sharper and in focus, and was quite comfortable to look at.\n\nFor the record, I've got perfect vision and have never worn glasses.\n\n3. Phone controller\n\nThe last part of the tutorial explained how to use the phone, it is super intuitive and straight forward. \n\nThe screen splits in sections, and it just works as intended  (much better than I expected). The screen also vibrates when touched and the phone battery depleted very slowly during use. Some apps, like Space Slurpies, also make you rotate your phone to control the game for example. \n\nIt is, however,  3dof and a bit annoying, but overall I was very pleasantly surprised on just how good it felt to use. \n\n4. Comfort\n\nThe vive flow is extremely light and comfy. The build feels premium, and the device really hugs your head quite tight, it's not really moving much at all even when looking down. I worn it for about 2 hours with zero issues.\n\nOne thing to note though, it comes with a narrow facial interface and I would prefer wide.\n\nI connected the glasses with the quest 1 power adaptor, and even though the charging cable is really long, I still found it a bit annoying. Hopefully it will feel better with the powerblock. \n\nAlso, my phone doesn't support reverse charging and thus I can't really power the vive flow with it.\n\n\n5. Screen \n\nThe screen resolution is really nice, I didn't notice any screen door effect. It is sharp and clear, no godrays, and reminded me of gear VR.\n\nThe refresh rate definitely feels like it's not 90hz (it's 75). The FOV is slightly smaller than Quest 2, especially horizontal.\n\n6. Tracking\n\nHere is my main issue with this device. Although it's 6dof, the tracking seems a bit ... Off. I don't know, may be I got spoilt by oculus quest 2 and cosmos elite, but everytime I move my head, surroundings also shift slightly. It's much more noticeable in some apps than others, for example in Tripp it was almost perfect. I think it could be related to pancake lenses design distortion and my wide IPD.\n\n7. Apps\n\n I didn't find all included apps on my device, however there are more than 70 apps available for the flow on viveport infinity, some of them are quite good. \n\nI especially enjoyed Tripp, Curious Alice, Deadalus and few other games on there. \n\nAnother highlight is vive low fi. It's really cool, I loved sitting in a virtual cafe, watching YouTube on a big screen.\n\n\n8. Miracast\n\n I think this is the main use case for this device. It's working really well, however I would like to see more controls over the virtual screen and environments too.\n\nAlso, i wasn't able to stream Disney plus or Netflix due toy oppo phone apparently not supporting it (need to look into it further)\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177816,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Flow review and AMA","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.97,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/qp7fgi\/vive_flow_review_and_ama\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Hermes_tri","author_created_utc":1460691474,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_x6q36","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1635723410,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1636118277.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"qk1j4r","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"hdw viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"5ca4b972-9808-11e5-a43c-0e3cca2f2cc3","link_flair_text":"Hardware","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_qk1j4r","no_follow":false,"num_comments":20,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/qk1j4r\/vive_flow_information_and_upcoming_review\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"0hDgzfB4x0ayBCm29fgbHWa2JsQhfRX46QTKInEB0hc","resolutions":[{"height":60,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uQsc8zYLewAXegQ6Cx6CSPRB1S0vVhFRhEdQgezjbek.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed202e5e02cd1138175d1e17abe68f65df9cb1e8","width":108},{"height":121,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uQsc8zYLewAXegQ6Cx6CSPRB1S0vVhFRhEdQgezjbek.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90e5d02a0fbf3c20626b3d53e9a0f95178571b43","width":216},{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uQsc8zYLewAXegQ6Cx6CSPRB1S0vVhFRhEdQgezjbek.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e48eea83771e1659df3d1509700773c99836c4d","width":320},{"height":361,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uQsc8zYLewAXegQ6Cx6CSPRB1S0vVhFRhEdQgezjbek.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6475d4fd17f5ac26130c36db7d0bcdab875aef2","width":640}],"source":{"height":417,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uQsc8zYLewAXegQ6Cx6CSPRB1S0vVhFRhEdQgezjbek.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=add6846adec692067acbac8a4cc4848db3349253","width":739},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656112104,"retrieved_utc":1656112104,"score":13,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Edit:\n\nI've received Vive Flow today and used them for about 2 hours while plugged in to a power socket with a long USB type C cable (the power bank hasn't arrived yet).\n\nBelow are my first impressions and thoughts (spoiler: overall opinion is currently mixed):\n\n1.

Vive offers 14 days return policy in my country so if I find it not very useful I will send it back.\n\nBackground: \nI have been using VR since the CV1 and currently have Vive cosmos elite, Oculus Quest 1 and 2. My ipd is 70.\n\nSome of the extra information I uncovered while researching the device:\n\n1. You can use any Android phone to control the device (but other functionalities will not be available)\n(There is also some information that iPhones can also be used to control the device although I'm not sure it's correct)\n2. There is a black and white passthrough \n3. You can use the vive flow without a controller by gazing at different menu elements and clicking a button on the device itself\n4. There is a passenger mode, I believe it disables 6dof tracking (similar to what Quest 2 does in low light environment).\n\n7 included experiences are:\n\n1. RemindVR: Daily meditations\n2.

I posted every VR demo I can find and link them here, and give a mini-review as well.  I will be using the Steam Index to test these games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAgain, like last time, these are my own personal review of the available demos and unless I tell you to definitely avoid it, I suggest checking them out for yourself and judge your own opinion if you find my mini-reviews too harsh, which I can be if the game is lazy and\/or insulting bad game design. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games are rated 0-5, with 5 being amazing quality.  I understand these are not AAA quality games and as they are demos there be bugs and missing features, so they are rated depending on the potential on the idea (and bonus points for originality), how much effort is put into its graphics and gameplay and the content and easy access of the demo's features.\n\nI also have to say this time around that a lot them were unable to be played due to being unable to play the game, so if the developers can fix the issues addressed, contact me and I will review it (I still won't hold back if the game is good or bad)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere is every game listed and linked:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Agent Simulation  \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1708050\/Agent_Simulation\/\n\nThis is a tough one to review.  It looks like the developer has a clean idea and has put some effort and polish to make this title work, but it really feels like\na weak game overall.  Normally you can initially tell if a game has effort or not and I'm conflicted with this one, I feel this developer has tried, but the poor gun mechanics and general gameplay feedback (getting hit, lack of design) really hurts it too much to not even reach an ok state, not to mention the \"wants to be superhot\" feel to it.  it only really gets an extra point for the extra effort involved.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Alien Dawn - 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1376580\/Alien_Dawn\/\n\nI once downloaded a beta of this game many months ago, it was a poor open field of nothingness, and very little has changed.  There's no tutorial, your just spawned and expected to know what to do, everything looks rough and crude, the gameplay is slow and shoddy, I died twice to enemies minutes after spawning since I had nothing, no guidance, no weapons, no basic knowledge of general VR and survival games.  Not to mention it's 9 gigabytes of what exactly?  Honestly, what a piece of shit experience.  Avoid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Beers and Boomerangs VR  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1588610\/Beers_and_Boomerangs_VR\/\n\nThere's nothing I dislike more in VR than stand and shoot arenas, and this game...was the most fun one I've played.  Instead of frustrating you in a locked\nroom, it changes the game to a protection game with a charming design and clean gameplay (boomerangs are much more fun to play with!), good job developers for making this genre actually fun to play for once.  If you're wondering why its not rated higher, it's way too simple in design, even if its presented nicely, it really needs more depth to its gameplay.  It's not the fault of the demo, the content is long enough to play but after the tutorial and first round, I felt like I did enough and didn't want to keep going.  This title can easily be rated much higher with improvements to its gameplay design.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ergo  \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1654520\/Ergo\/\n\nFrom the game's cover picture I thought this game might've been a low budget but interesting title, but sadly in-game it's presented so badly and crashed twice in an insultingly ripoff Portal room, that I think it deserves what it gets.  Avoid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Fractured Atmosphere  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1302490\/Fractured_Atmosphere\/\n\nThis game was introduced strangely, first it appears to be FPS, then changes into a spaceship sit-down experience... then back to FPS, it really\ncouldn't decide what type of game it wanted to be, making it pretty uncomfortable to navigate.  There's nothing really going for this game, the game starts\nto explore a broken down ship, which some parts play out and look alright, but overall it's generally a weak and unfulfilling experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Fruit Ninja VR 2  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1575520\/Fruit_Ninja_VR_2\/\n\nI never played the first game but I heard nothing but good things about it.  I can't judge this as a sequel, but it seems as it currently is nice and polished, although a bit... too simple in design (much like Beers and Boomerangs from earlier), but the physics feel plays great to play and the music was really nice.  I wasn't a fan of the short ranged teleport movement, I know teleporting as a choice feature its a must for comfort but the movement felt unnecessary awkward and felt like a step back to 4 years ago for VR games. I would like to rate the game higher, but it feels like a minigame that an actual title right now, even in its demo state.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**HOPE VR Emotional Intelligence Assistant  \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1703740\/HOPE_VR_Emotional_Intelligence_Assistant\/\n\nHey Hope, why is your game awful?  I hope you understood that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Musical Range  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/547670\/Musical_Range\/\n\nMaybe if I try and copy Beat Saber and all those clones, maybe, maybe no one will notice.  This is the worst of these ripoffs I've played.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Nature Treks: Together  \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1521040\/Nature_Treks_Together\/\n\nThe game almost felt unplayable since there was performance issues on everywhere (and every other demo that actually booted up performed fine).\nI get that it's trying to be a exploring multiplayer game, but I can barely do anything under piles of delays and visual clutter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Neo Art Space  \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1714400\/Neo_Art_Space\/\n\nIt started off as an underwhelming psychedelic visual experience, but then it \"promotes\" you to explore... then suddenly, blocks you off with an invisible wall.  It's not worth playing, even for the visuals, pretty much every other game in this category does it better.  I hope this game wasn't planned to be paid.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Noun Town  \u2013 4.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1643100\/Noun_Town_VR_Language_Learning\/\n\nI love this game, and I had played the demo before this festival.  Not only have I wanted a VR education title around language learning, but even the way\nthe game is presented is so nice and charming that I would've liked the game just for that.  If there is a negative to me (and the only big negative really) is that sometimes it doesn't accept the words i'm trying to say in voice communication, but it does eventually work and gets through.  it's quite a big deal for a game like this, but I'm sure they will address &amp; improve upon this before completion.  I even left playing the game learning something new, how often can you say that about an experience?\n\nIt's just great, just check it out folks\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outlier  \u2013 4.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1596690\/OUTLIER\/\n\nThis is another demo I had played before this festival.  A really solid dungeon crawler.  Much like \"Sweet Surrender\" of last festival, this game takes notes from other games of its types and tries to make it it's own thing whilst learning what worked and what didn't beforehand.  In summary, I liked the combat, enemy design AND challenge (these enemies wont hold back!) but what was lacking is the environment, while stylized it felt a bit empty in colour and variety, it isn't bad at all, its good in its own right, but got a little tiring and didn't feel interesting enough to look at to keep going and seeing more, like others games of these types do.  \n\nThe first playthrough it felt like the game was buggy and had trouble moving around the map, but the second time around I didn't have issues so it might be a case of being more experience than movement issues.  The other thing I like to mention was the power-ups were not clear what they did, even through a mini-description and I hope the final game clears this up as it seems crucial to know what you get rewarded with to dive deeper into the map.\n\nOverall one of the better games in this genre, I was most impressed with the difficulty balance, as it would've been a 4\/5 game review, but the enemies were really fun to fight and didn't reach the point of being unfair and taking this fun away.  Still, that shaman bomber though...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pipeline  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/971040\/Pipeline_VR\/\n\nI'm not sure if this game type has been done before in VR, but it set out what its meant to do, it's a pipe connection puzzle in VR, and it plays and looks fine, but that's really about it.  The tutorial wasn't that helpful, I had to play it twice to understand how it all worked, and the demo was just one basic level, a little short (even for a demo).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Project Meta  \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1646580\/Project_META\/\n\nI booted the game up, looked quite good, I started a new map and.... I couldn't start anything.  The buttons (which are confirmed to be clicking) won't spawn enemies so all I can do is look around and SPEED AT ULTRA HIGH LEVELS DEAR GOD I'M GOING SO FAST.  It looked like it might be an alright game but without actually having anything to do, this is the rating it gets.  It would be lower, but I just had fun using the boosts to move around at crazy speeds.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Puppet Play  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1666890\/Puppet_Play\/\n\nThis was... interesting.  Initially I loved the concept, moving and acting out with toys to tell your own story, but that really just it, if you're not really up for roleplaying or playing around with cosmetics and miniatures, this isn't really the game for you.  This game is begging to playable with multiplayer and with the right features it could have some amazing potential for hilarious results.  Although I will say that the movement system needs work, I hate using the right controller for locomotion, it feels... wrong.  I know why the developers did it (since left controls the camera) so I hope there's an option to reverse this (is there one already in-game?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Puzzle Cafe VR  \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1659760\/Puzzle_Cafe_VR\/\n\nIt's just a poorly implemented jigsaw puzzle (and maybe more basic games in full version).  it's not worth playing this poor experience, VR or flatscreen.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Slappy Board - 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1714910\/Slappy_Board\/\n\nMixed feelings about the game, on one side the concept is great and slapping targets and pushing them out windows is fun, but on the other hand, it's pretty weak in design and there doesn't seem to much thought in visuals or gameplay terms other than \"just slapping things\", this could be fine for a sandbox to slap everything around you, but even that needs gameplay as well.  I didn't dislike it, rethink how the game works and I like to give it another shot... err, slap.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Break-In  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1397390\/The_BreakIn\/\n\nThe concept of working with other people to rob a house sounds really fun and a good laugh, but everything falls flat in design.  The art style is poor, the gameplay is slow and annoying, there's no tutorial and lack of navigation makes it confusing what you have to do.  I had to play this twice just to make certain I was doing it correctly, since I thought I was playing it incorrectly, but no, still the same shit.  Great concept, badly executed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Riley Short: Sibling Circuitry \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1123820\/Riley_Short_Sibling_Circuitry\/\n\nI... I think I just got trolled.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**VR Quiet Life  \u2013 0\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1404330\/VR_Quiet_Life\/\n\nOh shit, here we go again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Frigid VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1505850\/FRIGID_VR\/\n\nThis game boots up the menu, but I cannot start the game.  No button on my controllers triggers the menu, so I cannot review this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Jetpack Vacation**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1293930\/Jetpack_Vacation\/\n\nThe game loads and plays, but I've not been able to play with anyone yet, since it requires other players to get started.  It seems to be a lot of fun, and I've always wanted a Rocket League inspired game for VR, lots promising from what I've seen so far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Magic Stone Guardians**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1708750\/Magic_Stone_Guardians\n\nThe game does not load, I just get stuck on a black\/blue screen for 1+ minutes\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Seed of Life**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/370320\/SEED_OF_LIFE\/\n\nThis is not a VR experience, if you see this in the festival ignore it (unless you want to play it even if its not VR)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Skiing VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683690\/Skiing_VR\n\nThe game doesn't seem to control with my Steam Controllers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Time Patrol**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1330690\/Time_Patrol\/\n\nThe game also has an error message and wont boot up the game\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**VR Giants**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1124160\/VR_Giants\/\n\nThis game requires 2 players locally to play.  I won't have a local VR contact for a while, so I can't review this game.  I will say that I hope the developers\nkeep the demo on longer after the festival so people can have a fairer chance in trying the game out, since people like me won't be able to play it asap.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177814,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"October

my fellow Virtunauts,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas many of you, I have a some trouble seeing without my glasses. And for my new Vive Pro 2 I wanted to know if my usual store of trust yields the best view possible with it's VR prescription lenses.\n\nFull disclosure: This hasn't been sponsored by any of the companies listed. Also my bff's bf is an optician and he and his colleagues always inspect my optical gear after shopping. They chipped in mainly because we like to start out reviewing optical equipment from customer and professional point of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe contestants are: VR Optician, WidmoVR and VR Lens Lab\n\n\\----\n\nFirst opinions on the product\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've looked at all three pairs and links for pictures are at the bottom. They are all similarily priced but the difference in quality is quite visible to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWidmoVR suprised me in a very negative way. The adapter is a simple 3D print, thin and with a cheap look\/feel. In terms of quality the adapter itself takes last place easily. Also there is a piece of plastic on the lens-sided rim which is disturbing to me.\n\nThe lens has a bit of an uneven border and looks like someone did a not so good job fitting that in compared to the others. If my glasses looked like this I'd really be bummed about that area in the lower and upper left.\n\nAnd there isn't even a case, just a cool looking paperbox and a satchel to put the adapters in. I've read so many comments about people being happy but after I saw the product, I was disappointed and doubt their opinion.\n\nEven though the lens had the smallest surface it was the highest adapter. A somewhat bad combination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VR Optician adapters looked a lot better. They have a nice finish on the adapters and the lens looked like it was put in by a professional. Also the lens was a larger than Widmo's and the reflex looked better.\n\nThe adapter has a slit at the bottom and the lens isn't fully covered on one side. That puts me off. When pushing on and pulling the adapter from the headset I pressed too hard on the wrong which made the lens separate from the adapter. Also the adapter feels more wobbly when handling it on the slit area.\n\nOverall a better look and feel and nicer experience. But the design of the adapter being so prone to my clumsiness isn't to my liking. (But hey it's the sight that counts most).\n\nOne funny thing I noticed is that they include a wet wipe from Zeiss labeled as suitable for displays. (But is it good for the lenses?) They had a regular glasses case with the lens adapters in a separate soft satchel for each side and included an additional cleaning cloth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VR Lens Lab lenses have kind of nice adapters like the DJI FPV ones I have from them. They included a small round case and a soft cleaning cloth. The adapter itself is closed all around the lens and has a sturdy feel. It's finish is a little rough and has a good grip for pushing them on and popping them off.\n\nCompared to the others the lens looks very large. Also the lens is not only the largest but also the thinnest of the three. It is the only one with blueish reflex, which is somewhat less visible than on the other lenses and overall they have a fantastic look and feel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nView \/ vision\n\nAll 3 lenses had a good view. As I expected from wearing glasses the center was sharpest and the outer lenses still was good to view.\n\nWhen in VR I didn't notice wether the lenses had a green or blueish reflection.\n\nI couldn't spot any significant difference between Widmo and VR Optician. And I can't really put my finger on it but the Lens Lab lenses overall seemed a tad sharper than the others.\n\nAlso I had somewhat more area on VR Lens Lab (most) and VR Optician (second) adapters (I don't really look too much through the outer lens but it felt more free to me).\n\nOne thing I didn't like about the WidmoVR and VR Optician adapters was that they were thicker and I think I'd need to increase the distance somehow if I would want to use them. My eyelashes constantly touched the lenses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResult:\n\nIn my opinion the VR Optician lenses pulled in a good second with VR Lens Lab being in the first place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though the view with Widmo's lenses was OK, I was disappointed with everything else about the product.\n\n(Except the paper box, that was cool. That doesn't help with the other points.)\n\nIn this review they came in third. But I think if other companies were added they'd still come in last.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nComing back to VR Optician... their product is definitely better than Widmo's but that the lens came out so easily wasn't favorable at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVR Lens Lab's edge over the competition was the large lens in a thin adapter and a full frame around the lens but more importantly the experience in VR was somehow a tad better.\n\nIt may be the thinner adapter or the lenses. I don't know but that was my experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\nProfessional opinion\n\nDisclaimer: this paragraph is written by my optician friend. Most things I don't understand and it's better that he writes them himself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHey I'm Tom. I've been an optician for more than 22 years and worked in different price ranges and with different suppliers (I worked a lot with Rodenstock and Zeiss, too.)\n\nMy colleagues and me looked at all three pairs from a professional point of view and tested the following:\n\n\\- is the prescription correct and the axis in line,\n\n\\- are the lenses what they promise (Zeiss logo in the lenses for HQ Zeiss lenses, no logo for lower quality; same goes for Rodenstock)\n\n\\- how is the AR coating,\n\n\\- sizes of the lenses itself,\n\n\\- guesswork about the lens index,\n\n\\- overall product quality\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrescription and prescription alignment:\n\nAll three are good and well aligned. There are some minor differences but in optical terms they all pass easily.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat lenses are these:\n\nA short information beforehand. Most lens suppliers offer two lines of products. The high quality brand name and the lower quality (which sometimes is bought from somewhere else and resold for a cheaper price.)\n\nFor both you can say bought at XY but only one type is an XY lens the other is the (external) budget line.\n\nFor the optician there are three ways of distinction:\n\nDoes it have the brand logo in the lens (mandatory for e.g. Zeiss and Rodenstock),\n\nthe AR coating (you have to know what to look for) and the price (we know the prices we would pay).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe WidmoVR adapters:\n\nthere is no \"R\" in the lens, while the AR coating looks OK. It's definitely nothing more than budget line and a stock lens (might be edged lens for other \/ higher prescriptions) especially with that price and manufacturing time.\n\nStill the price somewhat covers the lens you will get. They might be bought from Rodenstock (though I'm not to fond of their budget line, e.g. they have slightly different reflexes on front and back side) but it's not the HQ brand lens.\n\nThe lens itself looks like the trainee trimmed the border (I wouldn't dare to send it out like this) and the adapter looks sub par. Also the lens is the smallest and pretty thick for the size and \"high-index lens\". Might be 1.6 index.\n\nMy verdict would be that it's an OK package but not great. If you use those and see good, then there is no harm done. But honestly I expected more. I wish they'd trade off the box they ship for a better quality adapter or at least a real case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VR Optician adapters:\n\nsame as the Widmo lenses there is no brand logo etched into the lens. For Zeiss HQ brand lenses this is mandatory since around 3-4 years.\n\nThe AR coating looks like Zeiss's budget line (and their budget line is of better quality then others - I'm looking at you Rodenstock). Their lens is larger than the Widmo lens. And I'd guess it's a stock lens, too. (The manufacturing was quite fast, but they might put in edged lenses with different prescription.)\n\nFrom the thickness and surface curve I'd guess 1.6 (they are thicker than the Widmo lenses, but that's because of the larger surface).\n\nThe manufacturing was a lot better. The adapter itself has a better finish and OK grip. It feels tumbled. The slit seems to be there for easier removal but makes the adapter a bit finnicky to handle.\n\nI think it's a better deal for almost the same money. More experience is reflected in the products quality. The lenses are machined (probably by Zeiss, looking at the machined border.) and fitted professionally. Overall a better, more solid choice than Widmo.\n\nWhat's a bit uncool is leaving some of the lens rim uncovered. This makes it easier for the optician to put the lens in and they have some wiggle room. But it also makes it easier for the customer to pop the lens out, which is an issue. This isn't well done.\n\nThe wet wipe leaves me thinking, why it is made for displays which have different material and coating than optical lenses, also they offer lens specific wipes. A quick call resolved the issue and they should be OK for cleaning, in this case it's more a question of label.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe VR Lens Lab adapters:\n\nFirst of all the AR coating is the best we have seen in a while even compared to regular glasses and definitely the best of the three. It also feels smoother, has a better lotus effect and was the easiest to clean. (That is always a good sign.) The material itself sounds like the better quality of two options.\n\nThey praise themselves that they offer free-form technology in their lenses. And indeed we found faint engravings along with a code, which means that it is probably true.\n\nThere are more hints when measuring the lens at different points. This left us baffeld because this technology costs a lot of money for regular glasses. Their website says they produce their own lenses and that could be the gist of making free-form possible at this price.\n\nWe separated the lenses from the adapter and they are the thinnest of the three expecially in regards to the large surface. Those are definitely 1.67 lenses, maybe with either aspheric curve or due to free-form.\n\nTheir lens surface is also quite larger (\\~10mm) than Widmo's and still a bit larger than VR Optician's (\\~5mm).\n\nThe finish of the adapter is even and closed around the rim like it should be. The adapter and lenses as product look well made. From what I've read and seen it looks more like an industrial approach which is reflected in precise manufacturing.\n\nIn all our tests they came in first, sometime by a lot. The product overall looks like top quality from adapter to lens. The free-form and anti reflection coating makes it outstanding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Quick Overview:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- lens surface width x height; thickness (including lens) -\n\nWidmo: 37.8mm x 32.9mm; 11.mm\n\nVR Optician: 43mm x 38mm; 10.8mm\n\nVR Lens Lab: 48.5mm x 43mm; 8mm\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- coating rest reflex color -\n\nWidmo: green\n\nVR Optician: green to teal\n\nVR Lens Lab: blue rest reflex\n\nMost likely less noticeable in VR but the rest reflex is also a sign of coating quality.\n\nWidmo and VR Optician were close to each other. VR Lens Lab took the lead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- coating lotus effect -\n\nSimilar to the rest reflex: Widmo and VR Optician were close to each other. VR Lens Lab took the lead again, this time with a stronger lotus effect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nSince WidmoVR has been praised so much I had higher expectations and their adapter and lens fitting left me a little salty. They called themselves \"leading\" a while ago but they were the tail of the options we tested.\n\nVR Optician on the other hand seems to be a better deal, had better manufacturing and better lens quality than WidmoVR. (Even though I dislike using the brand name and supplying the budget line. Still a good package tbh.)\n\nBut after what I've seen, VR Lens Lab was my favorite in terms of quality, manufacturing and lens technology. Imho they seem to be underrated. Our \"test customer\" felt better with their lenses, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHopefully that will help someone to find the best deal for them. Of course you will have to decide for yourself and if you have an option that works for you then everything is cool. We wanted to provide a comparison from customer and optician's point of view.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAddendum: We asked at VR Lens Lab about the adapter size and different prescription. Because we think they can't fit all prescriptions in an adapter this thin. They told us, that they will select the thinnest adapter possible for each prescription but for plus lenses and \"Custom FOV\" the adapter needs to be bigger to accomodate to the lenses. (We ordered optimized)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo from here on it's me again. I hope you enjoyed the read and comparison.\n\nAfter checking out different adapters I can tell which I like best and maybe you can take something from it as well.\n\nIt was more for practicing to write reviews which we'd like to get into and the fun part was having different point of views.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing left to say:\n\nPlease spare me and others the usual comments\/yells like \"I have XY and they are the best!\" or \"I'm happy with my XY lenses!\".\n\nI'm sure they work great for you and that's important. But I specifically ask to make more educated comments than these.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here we go with the photos:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll three of

So far:\n\n\\- I've setup a webcam overlooking my keyboard\/physical desk and positioned it with OVRToolkit\n\n\\- I'm currently using a software driver to allow me to create additional virtual monitors, however....\n\n\\- I have also ordered some 'headless ghosts' to allow Virtual Desktop access to multiple screens (I only use one pancake on my VR rig)\n\nCould I get some  pointers, suggestions, opinions etc on some decent VR Office setups?\n\nP.S.

Could move as aggressively as I needed to and it wouldn't bounce around or feel sketchy.\n\nTo vive pro was mixed but I couldn't go back to og vive, looks better, easier to take on and off, but the games I would move very intensely in it bounces around, and build quality was dissapointing, a bit shaky but not horrible at all.  Definitely looked more premium.\n\nVive pro 2, I immediately thought it looked much worse, less depth, horrible horrible horrible glare, and yes even in game it muddies up the image just not as obvious as white text on black background.\n\nPlayed beat saber with vp2 first, wow, so much less depth.\nUpdate: prefer this with vp1 due to contrast even with 3080\n\nPlayed skyrim vr fully modded, nothing sticks out at me, if anything it feels more flat. \nUpdate: definitely looks better on vp2 with 3080, but not drastically so, and the distortion bothers me to where I still prefer vp. \n\nPistol whip seemed a bit worse too. Update: def looks better vp2 on 3080, but I wouldn't miss it if someone swapped headsets. \n\nI mean yeah the res is better... but I'm used to oled all day vive pro lg c9 120hz, and for what its worth I'm extremely picky with visuals and frame rate, always have been, things that are super obvious to me my buddies can't even tell sometimes.  I can definitely tell its higher res, but its not high enough to not see pixels I can see them easy still.\n\nSo far I miss vp everytime I'm in it, which sucks... oh build quality is a bit better on vp2, at least vs my vive pros (me and gf have one) but bought em close to launch.\n\nJust ordered gear VR lens so that should tip things in vp favor even more...\n\nI am currently using vp2 with living room pc that has 1080ti, so I'll be running cables from my 3080 pc soon, and I'm testing for a full 30 days before sending back. May just swap for vive pro eye if I don't like it and give my old vp to a buddy, unless index 2 or something is launching soon.\n\nUpdate: visuals is a tricky subject, I personally don't think trading clarity and less distortion and glare is worth an upgrade in resolution. So yes, vp2 is def high resolution, and if you look at certain things just right without moving, it will look better, arguable depending on the scene with glare and higher black levels but still definitely more detailed in some scenes. \n\nI personally can't stand washed out images for instance, it bothers the crap out of me, aka oled vs lcd, although this is a nice lcd, but with vp2 not only are you going lcd but you also add a LOT of glare and distortion, I've tested with 3 very different body types, we all want to like our shiny new toys but it's a visual downgrade in several ways. In a vr setting I have a hard time understanding how this is an upgrade.\n\nUpdate 2: if you play intensive games the vp2 moves side to side and up and down about twice as much as vp1, confirmed by others, this is due to increased weight. Pair this with bad distortion if headset moves on top of already bad distortion on edges and the horrivle glare it's not a good vr headset, it might be a good vr demo headset, or strictly for making alyx look better, but if you actually play vr I can't see anyone preferring this headset. I'll update if anything changes.\n\nUpdate 3: I am waiting till my knuckles arrive to play alyx. I will switch between vive pro and pro 2 every play session on 3080 10700k rig.\n\nUpdate 4: ordered 10mm face pad foam, and upgraded padding for entire headset, after the aggro posts (some now deleted) this face pad better make it at least 50% better but I have my doubts! If so then VR review channels are terribad which also wouldn't surprise me much.\n\nUpdate 5: I can easily read bottom row on eye chart, it's beyond 20\/20 I forget what they call it, so if you have worse near sighted vision maybe it's issues will be less to you. I also read silk print and work on circuit boards a lot.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177811,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive pro 2...

Especially used from second hands as in my country where I live in are PCVR headsets in stores very expensive and lack of them. \n\nI played VR for the first time somewhere in this month last year. It was exactly OG HTC Vive, and i was satisfied with it. I've seen people selling these for somewhere around 350 euros, including full Vive kit. Although original Vive is discontinued, i have concerns about Oculus. If their privacy is really sketchy, as I heard, then no, thanks. I dont want oculus products.\n\nNot sure, but i have seen that Vive has excellent tracking but bad resolution?\n\nThere's also another option which is the Reverb 2G that is now the best PCVR on budget so far in this year. Not sure now which one to pick. Every headset have their pros and cons. So please, let me know which to go with. I dont intend to make PCVR my type of standart gaming (so far, who knows), but i really want to play VR games such as Pavlov, Fallout 4, job simulator etc. I dont have any friends who play VR.\n\nPs: Im gonna upgrade from my GTX 1650 OC to RTX 2060 somewhere in August if this info helps.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177814,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is OG HTC Vive good enough for new VR users?

I mostly use it in my room, near my PC with a GTX 1650SUPER graphics card (it's VR capable). Really the only game I play is Beat Saber (but I may play some other stuff in the future), I'm pretty decent at it (Expert+ level, basically). I mostly use Oculus Link to play Beat Saber via my PC. And here are some problems I have with that:\n\n* I have a sort of fear for bad tracking, like if my controllers suddenly fly into the air in-game, maybe with a VR headset that uses basestations (like the original Vive) I'll be a bit more \"free\" and don't have to worry that much\n* I think with a precision game like Beat Saber good tracking would be a good benefit. Don't get me wrong, Quest 2 tracking is fine, but is the Vive's tracking better?\n* 1,5 hours ago I was playing Beat Saber and everytime I open the Oculus menu theres a small bit of lag, I still have a headache, I still feel dizzy\n* Beat Saber just performs horribly in-headset, but on the PC screen it has no lag. Like, at **all**. The game also doesn't slow down when I record with OBS, so maybe it's just that Oculus Link is bad for this type of stuff\n* The Quest 2 is horribly uncomfortable after 30 minutes, and I'm too scared to buy the elite headstrap in fear of it breaking\n\nNow here's my question: Is it still worth it to buy an original Vive? If I could afford a Vive Pro 2, I'd most definitely buy it, but I can't. I found a 400 euro original Vive set on CeX with everything included.\n\nAlso, again, is the tracking better on the Vive than the Quest?\n\nThank you!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177813,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Should I sell my Quest 2 and buy an original Vive?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.54,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/odmo52\/should_i_sell_my_quest_2_and_buy_an_original_vive\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"jholland513","author_created_utc":1366655836,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_bf1ap","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1624806208,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o8ys74","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o8ys74","no_follow":false,"num_comments":8,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o8ys74\/where_to_buy_an_og_vive_setup_either_nos_or\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1626774454,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Basically the title.

I really wanted and expected to be that guy who was the 1 in 10 post praising the VP2, but sadly that's not the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Background:\n\nI'm an OG HTC VR guy, hopped on a bundle deal HTC offered back in October 2017 for a full Vive kit + GTX 1070 for $799, was just the deal I needed to get into the game. It's been solid, I've put hundreds of hours into it and still rocking original 1.0 base stations and controllers without issue (though I did have to diy fix the soft clickpad issue on both controllers)\n\nI upgraded to the DAS headphones. Huge quality of life improvement over headphones or earbuds.\n\nWhen vive pro and wireless were announced I jumped on them both. I sadly realized my cpu at the time (4670k) could not keep up with the wireless so I ended up selling the wireless and rocked out on a wired vive pro. Loved it, worked flawlessly.\n\nFast forward to 2020 and I finally got a cpu upgrade, 4th gen to 10th gen, hah, and got a vive wireless used on hardwareswap, worked great, loved it, image quality was almost the exact same as wired, and it was buttery smooth. The pinnacle of VR gaming.\n\nSo when HTC announced the Vive Pro 2, I was that guy who did a pre-order that same day, to get it as soon as possible without silicon delay worries. First letdown of the whole process was people who ordered willy nilly after release day off 3rd party sites were getting their orders fulfilled faster than my day 1 pre-order, wtf HTC and Ingram Micro, but oh well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issues:\n\nFirst issue I had with the VP2 was I had no video output due to bad linkbox to HMD cable. I could get displayport and usb to 'connect' in the vive setup, but afterwards was plagued with either vive console not recognizing headset while steamvr did, or vive console showing connected while steamvr didn't, I reinstalled vive console, steamvr, video card drivers, nothing on wired. For grins I went to test wireless and lo and behold, video. After troubleshooting components I found I had a bad link box to HMD cable, with 100% consistency I would not get video with new VP2 cable, however when I swapped out the cable with my old VP1 cable I would get video. The drawback here, however, was that there must be some difference in the cables as I could only choose the first 3 video quality options in the vive console, ultra and extreme were grayed out (though I have a 3080). I tried high setting with SS cranked way high in steamvr, but I'm not getting increased crispness I feel like, which I confirmed with a 'balanced' vive console setting with steamvr SS cranked up way high, it does not look the same as supposed same resolution vive console 'high' setting. So I am not able to realize the full crispness\/res of the display due to the bad cable\n\nThe second issue I had was the audio buzz in both ears.\n\nThe third issue I had was issues with the headset tighten knob, it was wonky and didn't properly loosen.\n\nThe fourth issue I had was how the headset sits. It is slightly different from OG vive and VP1, the HMD does not angle down enough, to where when I want to align it to my sweet spot, the back head rest is high on the back of my head and not a good weight distribution. If I extended the strap and put the back pad lower on the back of my head more centered, the sweet spot sat in a way, that when tightened down, the HMD was super tight on my brow, with a slight gap on my cheeks. I've had years of dialing in fitment and sweetspots with OG and VP1, and this VP2 just isn't the same. When dialed in edge to edge clarity was better, sweetspot was better, but at a cost, see below.\n\nThe fifth issue I had was extreme eye strain.  I tried with default face padding, thin 6mm face padding, stock IPD, slightly bigger IPD, no matter what there is just something off that is causing massive eye strain. I'm not sure if this was due to optics, or reduced stereo overlap. There is some slight warping or fish lens type distortion around the edges, that could be what's messing with me, but certainly not what I see with VP1. \n\nAnother issue I personally had was black levels. Some people may not care about it as much, but damn the difference between OLED black and these grays for blacks was huge to me. The ambiance in certain games was severely hit by it. All in all, greatly disappointed with the new lenses.\n\nThe sixth issue was with wireless. Going over to wireless, at first, was extremely blurry, where IQ was better on VP1 wireless vs VP2 wireless. The beta update to unlock 'high' wireless setting helped with this, res did get better, but spread across the bigger screen it was still just blurry. The other issue I am having here is that on standard wireless res it runs fine, but wehn I set it to high wireless res, it cuts out constantly, like within the first 20 seconds of putting it on, in a cold ass AC basement, so I don't think it's an overheating issue here, but I cannot get VP2 high res to hold connection, it cuts out to completely off, then comes back after about 20 seconds, but only stays alive for 10 seconds before cutting out again.\n\nLast issue which was disheartening was HTC customer service. I was on the fence, do I keep VP2 and run wired, or stick with VP1 wireless. I couldn't give it a true comparison since the HMD cable was bad and I cuold only run in high, not ultra or extreme. HTC offered to replace the cable or headset, but said it'd be a 3 week process, and my 14 day return period would expire before I got the replacement. I asked if they would extend the return period to 14 days from when I received the replacement headset or cable, and they said no. They could have potentially saved this, maybe wired with ultra setting would have wowed me enough to move back to wired for time being with a kiwi system or something. But no, an OG vive, DAS, VP1, wireless, and annual viveport subscription member for the past 4 years was told they couldn't return beyond the first 14 days. It left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I hate to say it, but the VP2 is going back, primary issues were optics and eye strain, poor HMD fit on my face\/head, lack of blacks, blurry wireless, and HTC not willing to work with me on return window.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170934,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I really didn't want or think I'd post this...","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.82,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o76579\/i_really_didnt_want_or_think_id_post_this\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"simplexpl","author_created_utc":1390434136,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_exm51","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1624288018,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1625045641.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"o4x85c","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"shop automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_o4x85c","no_follow":false,"num_comments":33,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/o4x85c\/my_experience_with_preordering_vive_pro_2\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1626767661,"score":12,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"**Update 30.06.2022**  \nI just got my package - this time it was addressed correctly.

Shocked, I called the delivery company (UPS) to ask what gives. Turns out the package was not properly addressed, it was missing the building and flat numbers. Also they did not have my phone number so they could not contact me - so they sent it back immediately after it arrived to the destination city. Of course I provided all this data to HTC when ordering.\n\nWhen I contacted HTC it turned out it was \"my fault\" because I put the building and flat number into the second line of the address form (however they did not explain why the shipping company did not get my phone number - there was no way to put the blame on me). The form looked like this - both text fields are editable:Street name:\\[                                       \\]\\[                                       \\]\n\nTurns out that second text field where you can type is an Easter Egg - if you type something there, HTC ignores it, but they don't tell you this. As a result, HTC was happy to just put the street name on the package, without building number, flat number, and without my phone number. Who needs those, right?\n\nNow the best part. My ordered Vive Pro 2 which already was so close to me and yet so far (i.e. in the city where I live) was now gone forever. HTC said they cannot re-send it, it's impossible. Sure, why not, it's HTC after all.They told me to make a new order and even agreed to refund me the amount of the discount code, after I requested it.

However, it is now official that its a keeper.  In fact, I am really enjoying this headset a lot now.  The biggest lesson I learned is that it has a learning curve.  So rather than a review, here are just a few things I've learned over the last week or so that moved me to this position.\n\n1. I jumped immediately to a thin face pad when I got it based on reviews, but couldn't focus.  This bugged me for several days until, on a lark, I tried the stock pad.  This fixed all my focus problems while still retaining more FOV than my Index.  Problem solved.\n2. The glare bugged me, until I started doing normal gaming instead of testing, at which point I realized that it really wasn't much different than my Index and that in normal gaming it is rarely bothersome.\n3. It might seem silly, but I missed the button on the bottom of my Index that lets you go to Steam VR without the controllers and select buttons with your head.  But then I found that the the VP2, indeed has this button--well hidden on the side.  Then I discovered the volume controls on the headphones.  Cool.\n4. Performance was lackluster and a bit disappointing at Ultra on my 2080Ti\/i9 on a few important titles like XPlane.  However, after lowering the SS from 150 to 120 my performance went right back to what I was used to on my Index with virtually no reduction in clarity that I could notice.  In fact, performance and visuals were now superior largely across the board compared to my Index.\n5. Certain titles like Skyrim, though, looked oddly worse.  However, I learned that this headset needs different optimizations.  In particular, downloading 4k mods and turning off dynamic resolution in Skyrim blew me away, and I spent some time last night just sitting on a bridge, listening to the wind blow, while looking out over a landscape that now looked like what I once thought I imagined it might look like in some future headset.\n6. Sound on the VP2 was never a big disappointment to begin with for me.  Yeah, bass is less than my Index, but after using the headset for a while, I'm actually back to perhaps preferring the headphones vs Index style speakers if only for the increased immersion; and am re-discovering how headphones improve spacial\/surround-type effects.\n7. Comfort was an issue while trying different pads and adjustments, but now that I've had a chance to get it \"just right\", comfort is perfectly fine with no complaints about it at all--other than perhaps heat--but that goes for my other headsets as well.\n8. The software bothered me a bit at first--especially in how you need to restart Steam VR to change settings, but I've discovered that there are only two settings that I've settled on for pretty much everything, so now that I'm past testing, it's no longer a pain.\n9. The resolution is something I just can't go backwards on now.  Distance draw has always been a distracter for me in VR, and this headset goes a significant way toward alleviating that.  And just the fact that SDE is virtually gone everywhere else is quite amazing.  Color and contrast have also improved over the Index.  The Blu, feels uncannily real now, and Space Pirate Trainer is now perfected.  Board-type games like Demeo are remarkable.  Draw distance in Assetto Corsa adds to the game dramatically.  Systems being approached from a distance in ED no longer look like blobs.  And the list goes on.\n10. All this, plus the option for wireless.\n\nYup, its a keeper.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":170122,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"VP2, now a keeper - an HMD you \"grow into\"","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nywzrf\/vp2_now_a_keeper_an_hmd_you_grow_into\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Almog2929","author_created_utc":1516018211,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_s4108ei","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623571750,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nyrnsd","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"Google viabutton cCKpMw ","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"2f1d31fe-4d45-11ea-ae0b-0ee8d3710da9","link_flair_text":"Help me google  ","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nyrnsd","no_follow":false,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nyrnsd\/i_cannot_get_my_vive_to_work\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1624504950,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I really dont know what to do next,\nI've recently replaced my computer with a asus laptop and when i plugged my htc vive to it i could only get it to work of my igpu and not my gtx 1660ti.\nI have tried everything and contacted asus support (which was a loop of me updating my drivers and getting to a new representative that told me to do the same)\nHtc support just told me to use a different port, which i do have type c port that supports video out, and the vr worked out of the gtx but i got nothing on the displays, i could see what i did via steamvr vr view but nothing on the display.\nHas anyone had that issue?

I can't look at my Index anymore, pixels are too distracting. Vive Pro 2, at last, can be used as a monitor replacement. I don't have to take it off when working in Unity. Amazing and game-changing.\n\nAudio? Why are you using the headset audio, don't you have proper high-quality headphones? Index was very inconvenient to use with the headphones, and some, like my noise-canceling ones, didn't fit at all, but Pro is clearly designed to be used with them. If you wear it over the real headphones - it improves weight distribution, stability on your head and, unless you live in a quiet cave, immersion. They even include caps to cover the placeholder headphone mounts. \n\nMic? Irrelevant. I have a Shure SM7B, which is so sensitive it can clearly pick up my voice from the other side of the room. Get a real mic, you can afford it. You can probably afford 10 and put them all around the room. Wish there was an option to buy the headset without any headphones, mics, DACs and all the audio-related circuitry inside, it's a waste of space and energy.\n\nFoV and sweet spot? They're good, and I like the new aspect ratio. I use a 8mm pad. Seems that using it goes against HTCs expectations about eye location which they based their optics calculations on, so I had to add around 2mm to my IPD to get more comfort, less god rays and better edge to edge clarity. No, it's not a \"Vive Whole Family Gaming\" headset, it's a drivers seat in your car, and you don't let other people mess with how it's set up. And once it's set up, everything looks unbelievably clear.\n\nSoftware? It works and doesn't require me to type things into the terminal to use it. Good.\n\nHardware? I can turn it off from the link box, great! With Index, I had to unplug the power cable to truly turn it off, which was really inconvenient. A welcome change.\n\nBuild quality? They seem use the lightweight plastic that doesn't have that \"premium\" feel. Thank God, company that makes products with \"Pro\" in the name values practical aspects more than look&amp;feel. Wish there was an option to easily remove all the cover plates to make it even lighter, even more fragile and even worse looking because I don't care how it looks and I'm not going to drop it or walk face-first into the wall.\n\nOverall, this is Vive PRO, not Vive AVERAGE AMERICAN, and it shows in every aspect. And that's exactly how it should be.

is a super long post with 3 reviews, feel free to skip right to the end to read the conclusion if you dont want to spend hours reading \n\n# Vive Review\n\nMy first VR headset was the OG vive. I liked it, it felt quite immersive, I think thanks to the rich OLED colors and contrast, good stereo overlap, and a pixel\/SDE pattern that doesn't remind me of computer monitors.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe immediately obvious problem with it is that the resolution is very low. Even though it didn't hurt immersion that much for me personally, it is something that just obviously needs an upgrade.  \n\nThe FOV with the stock padding was also bad, if I recall correctly I measured 90 degrees horizontal. \n \nBy removing the facepad completely and having the lenses physically touch my face I could get around 108 horizontal (which is the vives theoretical maximum) and the edge to edge clarity was greatly improved.\n\n\nHaving to mess with separate headphones was also a bit annoying and added friction when getting in\/out of VR.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne visual disturbance that I noticed on the OG Vive that negatively impacted immersion for me was that there was a bit of distortion when turning my head from left to right in a 180 degree sweep.\nThe virtual world didn't look completely 100% stable and natural compared to real life when turning my head around and just focusing on corners of rooms and stuff. It felt like the rendered FOV was slightly different from what it should be in real life.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nsidenote about the distortion:\nI've done a bit of VR software development, and during that time i've done lots of experiments manually rendering views for VR with manual control over fov and image offsets and such,\nand accidentally discovered that I could seemingly fix this distortion by moving the final rendered left\/right eye images outwards (towards the sides) a bit.\nAnd I did have my headset IPD adjusted properly. So when you look at a point in VR at infinite distance on the OG vive, your eyes don't point straight forward, instead they point inward like when looking at an object that's close by.\nI found out that I can move the images outwards quite a lot until I start seeing double, so maybe the images by default are positioned excessively inward as a safety margin so that you dont see double even if the IPD is adjusted too high or something.\nIDK, just a theory, but it seems like it would be possible to fix this type of distortion with software by giving the user more controls.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomething I hated about the Vives physical design is that the plastic edges that the facepad mounts to forms sort of a \"cup\" at the bottom of the inside of the headset, where dust and stuff will build up, and it is very hard to clean.\n\nI only had the Vive for a few months before the Index was announced.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Index Review, after being used to the Vive\n\n## thoughts before getting it\nI preordered the index as soon as it went live. I was hyped by the claims on Valve's website of great edge to edge clarity and 20 degrees higher FOV than the OG Vive for typical users. I was also excited for 144hz, since 90 is noticeably slow, higher res obviously,\nand everything else, like the physical design of the headset, off-ear speakers, magnetic facepad, proper eye relief adjustment, etc, all great.\nOnly thing I was dissappointed in was their choice to go to LCD, but figured it would probably be fine, since after all I use LCD (specifically IPS, other types that i've used have looked like crap) monitors on my PC all the time, and I think they look acceptable,\nand since this is a VR headset I thought surely Valve would use panels that look just as good or most likely even better.\n\n## first launch day impressions\nWhen the Index arrived and I first put it on, my immediate reaction was that everything looks blue, the screendoor effect is clearly visible (there was some talk around launch about them having completely eliminated it somehow) and its a grid pattern like what you get when looking at a PC monitor from too close.\nThe overall image also looked more washed out and dull than I was expecting. As a result, the default SteamVR home initially looked almost moon-lit in the Index, compared to warm and sunny in the Vive.\nThe higher resolution was also immediately noticeable of course, and a decent bump over the Vive.\n\n## blue tint saga (not relevant these days but interesting history anyway from the launch time)\nI wanted to investigate this blue tint further. There is no way Valve could fuck up this bad.  \nI figured there are two possibilities.  \n\nPossibility 1: my unit is faulty  \n\nPossibility 2: the index is the first display i've seen that displays colors properly, and all other monitors i've used in my life are wrong.  \n\nTo try ruling out #2, I bought a colorimeter (i1 Display Pro) for calibrating my computer monitors in order to make proper comparisons with the Index.  \n\nI used a target whitepoint of D65 \/ 6504K, since that seems to be the standard used for computer graphics and games in general (sRGB).  \n\nThe Index still looked too blue. But now that I have the calibration device, I could try to actually measure the Index with it in an attempt to verify what I'm seeing.  \n\nMeasurement results: https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Xn9k7qv.jpg\n\nTesting methology: Index on a table lenses facing up, facepad removed, i1Display Pro device positioned directly at center of lens aligned to the center of the fresnel rings to the best of my ability.\nDirect Mode disabled from SteamVR settings developer tab, allowing the Index to show up as a regular desktop monitor. This makes it possible to use the DisplayCal software on it like a regular monitor. The test color patch size was set to full screen.\nRoom was completely dark during measurement with computer monitors and all other light sources turned off. Software settings are visible in the measurement report. A small piece of cardboard was placed in front of the distance sensor to keep the screens on. The screens were warmed up for a good while before taking the measurement.  \n\nAlso note: I'm not a professional display calibrator, I don't really know how valid these results are or what I'm doing. But right off the bat they seem to be in the ballpark with what I was seeing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI contacted Steam Support about my findings to determine if this is just a faulty unit. They told me they will add color management options to SteamVR.  \nA while later a SteamVR update was released that reduces the blue levels on the index by default (and adds config options for custom adjustment). [image of blue tint correction](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853059794839011328\/index_compositor.png)  \n\nThis tells me it was not a faulty unit and its just how the index is in general.  \n\nI really wonder what the reason behind all this is. My only theory so far is that the people at Valve working on the Index were wearing blue light reducing computer glasses while calibrating it.  \n  \nTLDR: after the update its mostly fine\n\n## displays\nAs mentioned in the first impressions, the image looked more washed out or dull and the contrast \/ saturation looked lower than I was expecting coming from the Vive's OLED.  \n\nSubjectively it even seemed to look worse than my IPS desktop monitors, or my IPS phone screen, or any IPS display I've used for that matter. \n \nI played CS:GO on the Index in desktop game theater for a bit, and it felt a bit like playing on a crappy monitor. Swithing to playing it on my desktop monitor felt like a relief, a bit like what I think of going from a regular TN monitor to IPS. \n \nI don't know what type of LCD panels the Index uses. Maybe it is actually IPS but looks worse for whatever reason, maybe not. It would be interesting to know for sure.  \n\nBased on my measurements the contrast ratio of the index is somewhere between 560-675:1 (seems to go down as the displays warm up, peak brightness gets lower but the black luminance stays the same).  \nMy desktop monitors measure at around 1100:1  \n\nBecause of the limited colors \/ contrast alongside the familiar square grid screen door, it often reminds me that I'm staring at a computer screen which is bad for immersion.  \n\nHeres some new measurements I tried to take for the comparison against the VP2, measured the same way as I did the VP2, so through the VR compositor and not extended mode, meaning the blue tint correction and stuff is applied here.  \n\n[130% brightness, cold screens](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060299468046357\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_130br_cold_2021-06-10_00-08.html)  \n[100% brightness, +6min](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060231386890290\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_100br_2021-06-10_00-14.html)  \n[50% brightness, +9min](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060164616847380\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_50br_2021-06-10_00-17.html)  \n[80% brightness, +12min](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060210628624424\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_80br_2021-06-10_00-20.html)  \n[130% brightness, +15min](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060253116792832\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_130br_2021-06-10_00-23.html)  \n[130% brightness, +30min](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060277715992616\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_index_130br_2021-06-10_00-38.html)  \n\nThere is a bit of drift depending on how long the screens warm up. I didnt wait for them to stabilize before these measurements cus that takes long lol. the first and last 130% measurements are there to give a better idea of this.\n\n## optics\nIn some ways the lenses initially seemed worse than the OG Vive. In direct A-B comparisons with Index lenses adjusted to press against my face, compared to a Vive with padding removed and lenses pressed against my face, the edge-to-edge clarity looked the same, but the Vive lenses had a bigger sweet spot and less glare despite having a lot brighter oled screens.  \n\nThe maximum FOV of the Index is also the same as the OG Vive, however I think the Index is still a big design improvement.  \n\nOn the Index, I can get the full max theoretical 108 FOV easily without having the lenses uncomfortably close and actively pressing hard against my forehead.  \nI think the canted lens design is an advantage here.  \n\nThe distortion that I mentioned I saw on the Vive when turning my head is gone on the Index. This is really nice!  \n\nThe lens shape is perfect (silimiar to og vive), they're cut in a way where the inside edges follow the angle of your nose and this does a good job of filling as much of the potential stereo overlap area with lens as possible.  \n\nI can still notice a tiny bit of missing stereo overlap near the top of my nose when looking forward due to actually seeing a small bit of the middle edges of the displays.  \n\nThe canted lenses seem to make it easier to get the maximum horizontal FOV even with my neanderthal-esque facial geometry with deep-set eyes and relatively prominent forehead\/brow.  \n\nThe vertical FOV upwards seems to exceed my real life vertical FOV, if I look up I see my eyebrows\/forehead block the view before the display ends, if i look forward I can see more of the upwards vertical FOV in my periphery but it is still extends beyond my vision.\nThe vFOV downwards is more limited compared to real life.  \n\nOn the subject of edge-to-edge clarity: As long as I don't look too far left or right and mostly use my head to look around, the clarity is perfect in my entire view\/periphery and couldn't be better.  \n\nIf I turn my eyes to the left\/right sides beyond like 30% of the horizontal fov things get blurry. I can look all the way up\/down though with almost no clarity degradation.  \n\nIn general I think the clarity is great. I can just throw on the headset and have an impression of \"Wow, its all perfectly clear!\"  \n\nI never noticed the glare or god rays to be an issue even if they seemed a bit worse than on the Vive.  \n\nSo overall I really like the optics.  \n\n## sound\nThe off-ear speakers are great, we all know it already, gold standard for VR.  \n\nThe sound quality is not as good as the big planar magnetic headphones that I use on my desktop on an external dac\/amp for dedicated listening. But this is obvious, and the Index speakers are good enough, well worth the convenience.  \n\n## other notes about the physical design and build quality\nmagnetic face pads are nice\n\nafter removing the pad, the inside surfaces of the headset are flat and easy to clean, unlike the vive.  \n\nrear cushion is not removable. bit of an oversight. being able to clean this is very important, it gets totally nasty after a while. there are covers for it that can be bought online however.  \n\nLenses are hard to clean properly because according to steam support, \"Avoid using liquids or cleaning products when maintaining lenses\".  \nYou're only supposed to rub them with the dry microfiber cloth, so its hard to properly clean all the skin oils and sweat that builds up on them.  \n\nOver time the glue around the lenses holding the rubber cover around them comes off.  \n\nSweat and moisture will get inside the lenses. This is visible as a clear spot on the lenses that looks like missing fresnel rings. After drying out the headset this effect will go away.\nWhen this happens repeatedly, eventually the impurities will build up inside the lens and there will be visible residue stuck in there. [image](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/554618715883307010\/826875879329890304\/lenses.png)  \nNotice the prominence of the rings around the outer areas of the lens, this is where the moisture gets and this is what it will look like after a while.\n\n## conclusion\nOverall, I like almost everything about the Index apart from the dull colors\/contrast and the SDE that further reminds me of looking at a monitor.  \n\nDespite this, I sold my Vive and kept the Index.  \nIf we ignore the colors and only focus on hardcore gaming performance, the index is the better tool for the job.  \n\nI play a lot of beat saber quite competitively and having 144hz is nice when playing songs at &gt;10 notes per second and some expert+ songs on the super fast modifier.  \n\nAnd everything else about the headset is a lot nicer as well.\n\n# Vive Pro 2 Review, after being used to the Index\n\n## thoughts before getting it\nThe VP2 on paper addresses the issues that I have with the index screens.  \nReviewers tend to agree that the colors and contrast are even slightly better than the Reverb G2 which has been regarded as having the best LCD panels out of all the VR headsets so far.  \n\nI'm also excited about the high resolution which should also mostly get rid of the screen door.  \nThe horizontal FOV is larger than the index which sounds nice.  \nThe vertical FOV is reduced but maybe that won't be an issue since I already have somewhat reduced vFOV due to face shape.  \n120hz is not as good as 144 but still better than 90 so it could be good enough.  \n\nApart from those the rest of the headset seems like a downgrade but it could be workable if the visuals are amazing.\n\n## first impression\nWhen I put it on the first time I immediately noticed that the image looked a bit warmer and\/or the colors look a bit more saturated, and the overall image looked darker.  \n\nI also noticed the mailslot type FOV and felt uncomfortable due to small stereo overlap. But I was expecting this from the stock padding.  \n\n## fov, optics\nI did a quick FOV test with the stock pad and got the following results:  \n100 horizontal, 75 vertical. This is a bad sign. My results are worse than pretty much anyone elses, the vertical is even lower than what VoodooDE got, lol.  \n\nWhen turning my head around I saw similiar kind of distortion that I did on the OG Vive. Its quite annoying and breaks immersion.  \n\nI removed the facepad completely and pressed my face against the lenses.  \nThe distortion when turning my head is worse now, and the stereo overlap is still noticeably limited, but not as much as with the pad. The FOV feels usable now.  \n\nI did a new FOV test like this, results: 114 horizontal 90 vertical. This is still not the theoretical maximum, and some reviewers got these numbers with the stock pad! This headset is clearly a poor match for my face.  \n\nEven if the FOV amount feels fine this way, this is uncomfortable, and I hate the reduced stereo overlap. The lenses are shaped in a way that its impossible to get good overlap since they dont follow the shape of the nose, instead they are rectangular, rounded off with small 45 degree corners on every edge.  \n\nThe edge to edge clarity seems a bit worse but similiarish to the index.  \n\nGodrays around the friends list names in SteamVR home are worse than on the index when moving my head up\/down and are quite distracting.  \n\nThe fresnel rings on the outer edges of the horizontal fov seem to light up sometimes when looking around in a distracting way and generally it feels like a bit of weirdness goes on around the edges.\n\n**TLDR;** I don't like the optics at all.\n\n## displays\nAs mentioned in the first impressions, the image looked a bit warmer and colors look more saturated than the index. The overall image has a darker tone but the colors are vibrant so the contrast looks good and to me the image doesn't look washed out at all.  \nThe brightness looks lower than what I was used to on the Index on its 130% (default? i dont think i've touched it) brightness.  \n\nThere is a bit of funny business going on. The screen brightness adjusts automatically depending on the scene. This sort of fakes the black levels and it makes it really difficult to do fair comparisons against other displays.  \n\nAfter using my desktop for a bit through SteamVR in the VP2, the colors and the image overall subjectively looks like my desktop IPS monitors, even though its not a proper brightness matched comparison.  \n\n\n\nI really wanted to do colorimeter measurements to compare this display against the Index, but it is harder to do here.  \nThe auto brightness needs to be disabled or the contrast ratio measurements will be worthless.  \nThe fresnel ring center on the lenses is offset, if I place the instrument on top of that I don't know for sure if there is enough lens on the side to cover the entire sensor area.  \nAnd it does need to be aligned properly, if I move my eyes way off the sweet spot the color shifts quite drastically.  \nExtended mode also doesn't work so it can't be tested in regular monitor mode.  \n\nDespite all this I've made an attempt. I managed to disable the auto brightness from a config file, this seems to lock the headset at a pretty low brightness though and I haven't found a way to adjust it.  \nInstead of using extended mode where the headset acts as a regular monitor, I used a program I made back in the index blue tint investigation days that reads the color of the displaycal \/ ArgyllCMS\ntest patches and renders it on the headset natively as a VR application through SteamVR.  \n\n[First measurement in LCD mode](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060327784972308\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_pro2_nolight_align_2021-06-09_23-14.html) \n \n[Another measurement taken on a different day using Refresh mode, thinking it might make some difference due to strobed backlight](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060349179330560\/Measurement_Report_3.8.9.3_pro2_refresh_align_2021-06-11_21-08.html)  \n\n[Software in action](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060120057872424\/software_in_action.png)  \n\n[Measurement \"stand\" lol](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060075811635240\/pro2_being_measured.png)\n\nAlso as an extra tidbit, it looks like the compositor doesnt edit the colors (or at least not the whitepoint, so no software blue tint correction like on index or similiar here) [image](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/852088618594992159\/853060097949696010\/pro2_compositor.png)  \n\nBased on the measurements it looks like the contrast ratio is smaller than the index, which feels wrong, although I do feel like I'm always craving more brightness so maybe there is something here. But again I have no idea how trustworthy these results are.  \n\n\nThe resolution increase is nice. SDE is there if you really look for it but for the most part its not an issue anymore.\n\n**TLDR;** I like the displays apart from the brightness.\n\n## audio\nI can hear some sort of faint buzzing in the background that changes volume based on the screen brightness.  \nAnd I'm already feeling a bit hot from having the headphones sit on my ears on top of being strapped in the headset.  \nSome people have been able to fix the buzzing by using different usb ports\/controllers.  \nI hopped into Beat Saber to test the audio quality, and it is laughably bad. It sounds like headphones you could get as a toy from mcdonalds.  \n\nMaybe it sounds so bad because something is wrong on my setup that also causes the buzzing.\n\n**TLDR;** its terrible, worse than I expected\n\n## physical design \/ build quality\ndesign looks same as vive obviously, except everything creaks. The og Vive felt like a rock solid brick, this doesn't.  \nworse than index in pretty much every way apart from the fact that its possible to remove the rear cushion for cleaning.  \n\n**TLDR;** its bad\n\n## software\nThe original Vive and Vive Pro worked natively with SteamVR without any extra software. This doesn't.  \n\nI understand the need for having a small external utility for switching the resolution\/display modes of the headset if its hard to get Valve to add that kind of stuff to SteamVR itself.  \n\nBut I don't think it should need to be running all the time or the headset won't work.  \nThe only reason I see for having it run all the time is if it controls the auto brightness, but you should still be able to use the headset without it and it should be an optional thing.  \n\n**TLDR;** don't like\n\n## conclusion\nFor me there are too many downsides compared to the index.  \n\nThe reduced stereo overlap, distortion when rotating my head, weird auto brightness, reduced vFOV, increased godrays and lens artifacts, all adds up to a weird and uncomfortable\/unnatural visual experience for me.  \n\nand on top of those pretty much everything else is worse as well. And the resolution and color bump isn't enough to offset all this.  \n\nI will be returning or selling the VP2 and going back to Index.  \n\nI have learned to appreciate the Index a lot more and I can live with it until a real \"Index 2\" comes out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nAlso, as a reminder: These are just my personal experiences and opinions, everyone sees VR headsets differently and prioritizes different things so you shouldn't base your own decisions on reviews like these, instead its best to try the headsets you're interested in for yourself.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169849,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive Pro 2 review (including og vive and index reviews for reference, conclusion: VP2 poor match for me, will go back to index)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":2,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nxv1x4\/vive_pro_2_review_including_og_vive_and_index\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Begohan","author_created_utc":1340596856,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_845gp","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1623336028,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1623339113.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nwp9on","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nwp9on","no_follow":false,"num_comments":13,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nwp9on\/first_impressions_from_longtime_vr_user_and_index\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623545464,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I know everyone has seen these walls of text already, so I'm going to keep this brief regarding my first impressions and hopefully I have something new to offer here.  First off it feels much cheaper than the index, plastic is creaky, it's pretty light, feel of the plastic is meh, but that's not too important.\n\nFirst impressions putting it on, with stock foam, is how it's almost entirely blurry and no matter how tight I ratchet it down it has a horrible FOV, sweet spot, and glare.  I kind of expected this and I have a  6,10,14mm face gasket ready to go.  I throw on the 6 and there's large gaps on the sides of my face, the vive pro definitely seems to fit wider faces better than the index as my index I had to mod the facial interface to make it wider, and with this it's got more than enough room.  The FOV and clarity definitely improves though. But I hate PU leather on my face, and I dislike the foam, the anti microbial fabric on the index is definitely where it's at.\n\nI throw on the 10mm and this seems to be the sweet spot.  But I am struggling wholeheartedly with finding the right fitment.  To be in the sweet spot, I have to have the lenses higher up on my forehead than I expect, cropping the bottom of the FOV.  My biggest gripe right here, is I can't ANGLE THE LENSES DOWN.  They are stuck at parallel to the back strap, so the further I pull the back down, the more the lenses are angled up.  This is a HUGE issue if you have a large brow ridge, with small cheek bones like me.  Index got this absolutely right.  Picture it being extremely tight on my forehead and almost no weight on my cheeks, far away from my eyes.  My eyebrows are touching the lenses leaving smears but they're still far away from my actual eyes.\n\nI have a neanderthal-esque brow ridge, while my cheek bones are flat. So therefore putting my finger across them I can feel my eye on my finger, it's shallow in that sense, but I could only achieve proper FOV and clarity on the index with the Magnet mod, which is stacking magnets on the top facial interface posts to angle the lenses down to allow them to get closer to my eyes.\n\nSo I don't see any good way to do this with the vive pro.  If I try to get the right angle onto my face, I have to have the back strap practically on top of my head, not very secure, and then the earphones barely\/don't even reach my ears at max length.  I know for a fact I'm not finding the maximum clarity.\n\nIf I just ignore the strap and hold the headset to my face in the perfect position, the FOV is fine, I don't notice the vertical much, the horizontal while bigger than the index \"feels\" pretty well the same. It's essentially on par with the index just a different aspect ratio.  The glare is probably the same as the index, while the god rays are actually worse, there are noticeable rays of light beaming out from text even in a bright environment as I move my head around. This greatly affects percieved clarity. Sweet spot is slightly worse than index. Edge to edge clarity in the most optimal position is about the same as index.\n\nWith the god rays\/glare, even in MY most optimal position, the resolution only appears slightly better than the index. The screen door is gone, but actual clarity seems damn near the same - I'm not seeing what I paid $1100 CAD for when it comes to this.  Text is clearer but it's not a game changer considering the other optical issues.\n\nAnd the headphones are worse feeling than I expected. They're fine, but I have grown to LOVE off ear headphones like the index, and these make me feel hot and uncomfortable in comparison. Treble and mids are more fleshed out, I can hear some things better, but the index has way more sound stage and bass. These are fine overall I suppose.\n\nOverall I am very close to just packaging this thing up and sending it back. It's worse in almost every way FOR ME than the index. I am going to fiddle with it for the next week or so and see if I can dial it in first.  If anyone has any advice for a magnet mod type thing for this headset, or somehow getting the lenses to angle down I'd happily take it.\n\nEdit: a couple more points, it goes without saying that the comfort with it fitting on my head like this is far from good. It feels like I have an awkward brick on my head, but the balance is good, better than the index. I dislike the giant foam padding at the back but perhaps if I could actually have it cradle the bottom of my skull like its intended to, it would hold in place better. The lens relief is actually finnicky as well, if I pull on it it clicks it out a few notches, where on the index it's solid as could be.  I dislike the ipd adjustment as well - but it works well enough.\n\nSTEREO OVERLAP\nthis is something I didn't understand until I saw it for myself. Apparently the vp2 has worse stereo overlap then all other headsets before it by quite a bit. I didn't know what to expect, but now I see it. If I am looking left or right, it feels like only partial of my vision is in 3d, and the other eye is looking at \"my nose\". It's blocked off, and it's like there's something in the way.  My depth perception on snipers in pop one is off.  It's not the worst thing ever, but it is a piss off and throws me off.\n\nThis thing feels hot. It's probably not hotter than the index, but the lack of ventilation (especially with my magnets on the index) with the nose flaps and the pu leather it's like having a rubber gasket around my eyes with 0 air flow.\n\nAnd the software finally has already had some crashes for me.  Sometimes if I turn on my index controllers the whole screen freezes for a second then they pop up.  Sometimes a game starts and it gives some odd error. Plus the friction with the resolution and having to restart steamvr to change refresh rates ect is just downright worse than the index.\n\nTl;dr if you needed a magnet mod on the index you'll most likely have a horrible time with this hmd.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169852,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"First impressions from longtime vr user and index owner","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nwp9on\/first_impressions_from_longtime_vr_user_and_index\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"TeTitanAtoll","author_created_utc":1583775079,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_58f4m06h","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1622850019,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1622959629.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nsimux","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nsimux","no_follow":false,"num_comments":21,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nsimux\/another_initial_impressions_of_the_vive_pro_2\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623537380,"score":48,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I know there will probably be a lot of these posts in the next few days, but I also know I appreciated hearing about different experiences while I was waiting for my own to arrive...so here's my contribution.\n\n# Background\n\nI currently own a Vive Pro w\/Gear VR lenses and a Quest 2.   I use the Quest 2 casually for a quick pick-up game here or there due to the wireless convenience, but the modded Vive Pro is my go-to headset for any serious gaming, and to this day, I still consider it one of the best overall VR experiences available.  I have also owned both the Valve Index and the Reverb G2, and in each case,  stuck with the modded Vive Pro and sold the other HMD.\n\nThe Valve Index really didn't come close to replacing my modded Vive Pro.  I found that the OLED-level blacks, vibrant colors, superior contrast, edge-to-edge clarity, and complete lack of god-rays and glare offered by the modded Vive Pro were far more important to me than the slightly diminished SDE, higher refresh rate and FOV offered by the Index.  The Index only lasted a few weeks before I sold it.  I did keep the knuckles controllers though.  They are awesome. \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe G2 lasted a few months, though we had a real love-hate relationship the entire time.  The G2 never really stood a chance of fully supplanting my Vive Pro.  I'm not sure any HMD with LCD panels will ever manage that, but with the bump in resolution and improvement in SDE, I did seriously consider keeping it along side the Vive Pro for games where blacks and contrast aren't a priority.   The clarity and sharpness of the G2 in the sweet spot was simply amazing...but I found the drop in sharpness as you move out from the center of the sweet spot to be fairly abrupt, so always had this sense that things in the periphery were out of focus.  Never could quite get used to that.  In addition, I found the native inside-out tracking to be sub-par, and the complexity of managing a mixed VR system on top of WMR to be too complex.  It was a real pain moving between my Vive Pro and G2, so the G2 eventually went on e-bay in search of a new home.\n\n# Expectations for the Vive Pro 2\n\nSo, why did I order a Vive Pro 2?  My hope is that it will offer some of the visual advantages of the G2, but in a native Steam VR configuration where I can seamlessly swap between my original Vive Pro and the Vive Pro 2, depending on which types of games I'm playing.\n\n# Initial Impressions\n\n* **Audio** \\- I definitely hear a humming noise from the earphones when other sounds aren't playing.  Not so noticeable in game when any other audio is playing, but it's there.  It's similar to what I've experienced on my Vive Pro with some poor quality USB C headphone adapters.  I am using a USB-C headphone adapter with a decent DAC now on my Vive Pro that doesn't have this issue, so I may try it out on the Vive Pro 2 just to see if the noise goes away.   Not sure if this is present on all headsets, or just a some (I've heard at least one other report).\n* **Brightness** \\- The display is definitely not as bright as the G2 (nor the Vive Pro, which is very bright).  I'd say the brightness on the VP2 about matches what I see when I turn on night mode on the orignal Vive Pro.  I don't really see this as a problem, as it feels bright enough to me, but it's worth noting.\n* **Black Levels &amp; Contrast** \\-  It's an LCD, so no surprise that the blacks and contrast in dark scenes are pretty terrible as compared to the OLED Vive Pro.  Simply not suitable for any caves, dark basements, sewers, etc., IMHO. The blacks do feel notably darker than on the G2 though, which surprised me a bit.  I expect the overall lower brightness plays a role here, and as a result, the overall contrast may also be slightly less than with the G2 as well.  I didn't perceive this as an issue when using the headset.  For me personally, in games where this is a concern, I'd likely be using the OLED Vive Pro in any case.\n* **Sweet Spot** \\- I didn't really have any problem dialing in the sweet spot on the VP2.  Probably futzed with the headset a lot less than I typically did with my G2.\n* **Clarity &amp; Sharpness** \\- I know others have reported it, but even so, this one surprised me. There was a lot of content and testing I did with the G2 when I had it, so even without the G2 on hand for a side-by-side comparison, I can tell that the Vive Pro isn't quite as sharp.   This was with the Vive Console set to Extreme, and Steam VR SS cranked to 200% (ignoring performance and focusing on clarity).  I'd say the 10% number others have been throwing around is probably pretty accurate.  On the other hand,  I find the focus uniformity of the VP2 to be a lot more consistent, and I don't have that sense that things just outside the center of my vision are slightly out of focus.  I do prefer the Vive Pro 2 here.\n* **FOV** \\- I haven't taken any actual measurements yet, nor played with thinner 3rd party face gaskets  but even with the stock gasket, I do perceive the wider overall field-of-view as compared to both the G2 and the Vive Pro.  As for the narrower Vertical FOV,  I didn't really notice it and certainly don't see it as a problem.  Overall, I think the VP2 has a nice bump in perceived FOV.  I'll try it with some thinner gaskets I have laying around at some point to see if I can get an even bigger bump, but doesn't feel necessary to me.\n* **God Rays &amp; Glare** \\- This one is the real kicker, and from my initial assessment the only real visual downside of the VP2 as compared to the G2.   God Rays  &amp; Glare were actually pretty minimal on the G2, but they are definitely present on the VP2.   It's been long enough since I had my Valve Index that it's hard to say how they compare, but they are certainly consistent with what I recall from the time.  My modded Vive-Pro has no god-rays or glare, so this was a significant factor in why I sold the Index at the time.  I know a lot of Index owners get use to looking past this, so I'll need to give it more time to see how distracting it is in actual gameplay.\n\n# Initial Assessment\n\nMy initial assessment is that I do prefer the VP2 to the Reverb G2, but the jury is still out on whether I'll be keeping it.   I'll need more time to decide how much the God Rays and Glare are going  to be an issue.\n\nThe VP2 does work very well along side my original Vive Pro.  I actually have my knuckles controllers on a pair of dongles (rather than paired via the HMD), so I literally just have to pull out one HMD or the other and plug it into the breakout box, grab my controllers, and I'm good to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Assessment (Added 6\/5\/2021 @ 10:30PM MT)\n\nAfter spending most of the day today putting the Vive Pro 2 through it's paces, some of my original impressions have changed, so I though I'd provide a quick update.  \n\n**Vs. Valve Index**\n\nI think the Vive Pro 2 is probably a solid upgrade to the Valve index.  It does have a lot of the same drawbacks as the Index with regard to glare and god-rays due to similar lens design, but if you're OK with those on the Index, you'll probably be OK with them on the Vive Pro 2.  It also retains a high refresh rate and wide FOV similar to that of the Index, while completely eliminating SDE and giving a pretty significant bump in resolution.\n\n**Vs. Reverb G2**\n\nThe Vive Pro 2 has a clear advantage over the Reverb G2 with regard to both it's superior tracking and it's wide field of view.  In the case of the FOV, I was able to get the FOV on the G2 pretty much out to the physical edge of the displays using 3D printed face gaskets, and I still don't think it compared with the FOV on the VP2 with the stock face plate.\n\nI originally felt that the Vive Pro 2 was better than the G2 in terms of sweet spot and focus uniformity, but after another day of use, I'd call it a wash.  I think they are probably in about the same league here, and honestly, neither is particularly great.  This isn't as noticeable when playing games, but when reading text or using Virtual Desktop the sweet spot feels fairly small on both.  The Vive Pro 2 does have slightly better absolute blacks than the G2, but as both are LCD panels, it really doesn't make a huge difference in content where blacks and contrast are important, so I'd consider this a wash as well.\n\nThe Reverb G2 has surprisingly little glare and god-rays, whereas on the Vive Pro 2, the glare and god-rays are fairly easy to see, particularly on high contrast content.  If you look at something bright on a dark background, you're going to be able to see the concentric circles from the Fresnel lenses in the periphery, and even the center of vision will experience glare and some loss of contrast.  Again, this is very dependent on the content being viewed, but when you see it, you see it, and it's not particularly hard to find glare\/god-ray susceptible content...it's visible even in the SteamVR menu.\n\n**Parting thoughts**\n\nI've boxed the VP2 up and will be returning it.   In the end, the advantages of the VP2 with respect to FOV and resolution weren't enough to offset the disadvantages with regard to sweet spot, glare, and god-rays.  For the time being, I'll just be sticking with my Vive Pro and Quest 2.  That combo is actually fairly well balanced, and both of those HMDs has a solid sweet spot with minimal to no glare or god-rays as compared to the VP2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169849,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Another Initial Impressions of the Vive Pro 2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.89,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nsimux\/another_initial_impressions_of_the_vive_pro_2\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","can_gild":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1622585058,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"youtube.com","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"nq5xp1","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"youtube mediainfo","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":"Curious Reviewers","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":{"oembed":{"author_name":"Curious Reviewers","author_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/CuriousReviewers","height":200,"html":"&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TPAIulBkJps?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;","provider_name":"YouTube","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/","thumbnail_height":360,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPAIulBkJps\/hqdefault.jpg","thumbnail_width":480,"title":"Video Game Bathrooms VR","type":"video","version":"1.0","width":356},"type":"youtube.com"},"media_embed":{"content":"&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TPAIulBkJps?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;","height":200,"scrolling":false,"width":356},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_nq5xp1","no_follow":false,"num_comments":6,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nq5xp1\/anyone_can_suggest_more_scifi_like_games_for_vr\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":"deleted","retrieved_utc":1623532879,"score":6,"secure_media":{"oembed":{"author_name":"Curious Reviewers","author_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/CuriousReviewers","height":200,"html":"&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TPAIulBkJps?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;","provider_name":"YouTube","provider_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/","thumbnail_height":360,"thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TPAIulBkJps\/hqdefault.jpg","thumbnail_width":480,"title":"Video Game Bathrooms VR","type":"video","version":"1.0","width":356},"type":"youtube.com"},"secure_media_embed":{"content":"&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TPAIulBkJps?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;\/iframe&gt;","height":200,"media_domain_url":"https:\/\/www.redditmedia.com\/mediaembed\/nq5xp1","scrolling":false,"width":356},"selftext":"[deleted]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169850,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":105,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Anyone can suggest more sci-fi like games for VR?

have a pimax 5K headset and to be honest by the time the image get to your eyes through the lenses your probably only seeing 360p to 480p at most.\n\nI think Headsets are falsly advertised saying they are  4k, 5k 8k headsets, but thats just marketing BS, the screen inside the headset maybe 4k, 5k 8k etc but thats not what you experience....it a bit like driving a farrari with a 500cc egine in it....it looks good but doesnt drive like a farrari.\n\nI game in 4K and games like Metro exodus look really nice in 4K but i wonder how long off it will be until we see a image through VR headsets tht looks like 4k resolution...I think only until then will vr truly take off when gamers can game in 4k in VR....to think about it maybe at least 1080p would be good.\n\nI wonder if anyone clever can do the math on the percentage reduction the image goes through after it passes through the fresnel lenses and get to your eye?\n\nMy thinking is that if what you currently see through a 5k headset is 480p its about 10 steps from 1080p as per this chart [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Display\\_resolution#\/media\/File:Vector\\_Video\\_Standards8.svg](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Display_resolution#\/media\/File:Vector_Video_Standards8.svg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is purley rough guessing but i assume we would need 32k resolution screens inside headsets to give us an image close to 1080p...which would really make gamers take notice.\n\nAbout the best game out there I've played is half life Alyx...if they could double that resolution then it would really get interesting.\n\nI just got the HP Reverb g2 to try out but dont think its a lot of difference than my Pimax 5k, i prefer the pimax as i dont like the feeling of looking through binoculars with the small field of view all other headsets give.\n\nSo to summerize i think we're at least 10 years off Actual proper decent VR  because GPU's would no doubt have to go through at least another 6 GPU generations as would the screen technology.\n\nI think now with 8k TV'S thats it for TV panels....as beyond this its unnoticable, I think after 8K is common place they should concentrate on 32k micro screens for VR.....and please someone come up with a new type of fresnel lense technology because surely someone can improve basic plastic fresnel lenses we see in most headsets.\n\nBecause of how light refracts off plastic compared to glass i think actual glass lenses would get rid of some of the weird ghosting\/light bleeding\/reflecting you get with nearly every headset i've tried.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169854,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A

Hear me out;\n\nA game, 150v150, The United States, Great Britain, and the USSR vs Germany, Japan, and Italy.\n\nMulti, real day campaigns in different theaters. Imagine sitting in a fox hole during Okinawa just to be shot from somewhere in the darkness at 2am. Or climbing Hacksaw ridge with your closest IRL buddies, and charging at every enemy, just to be shot by a well hidden sniper (who is also a person) and killed on the spot. Watching as your buddies fall around you from a mounted MG34 in a pillbox, just to fall yourself.\n\nImagine mowing down hundreds of Americans, feeling the rush, just to hear a hard bounce, and then you're on the floor, holding your intestines in, with your ears ringing.\u00a0\n\nNow think of pushing into the heart of The Third Reich, M1 Garand in your hand, seeing as hundreds of SS troops, troops that killed your closest friends, surrendering. You have to think for a moment... They killed your buddies, should you kill them?\n\nItaly might switch sides in the middle of a 3 day version of WWII, and now you are fig thing alongside one of your greatest enemies.\n\nNow into mechanics;\n\nYou are put in squads, which are a part of a bigger \"invasion force\". Now, I don't know much about the structure of WWII militaries, so I'm just generalizing here.\n\nYou spawn in waves, with each individual front that you fight in lasting for as long as it takes for one side to decide to surrender or have their place taken. It could take 15 minutes, or it could take a week.\n\nYou spawn in a tent, and you have to manually resupply, pick up a new gun, and move to the new front with automated trucks that'll drive you to what every section of the map your squad is in.\n\nYou slowly run out of supplies, and if you don't get resupply, either by clearing the airspace or destroying tanks in the way, you die anyway.\n\nFor die-hard players, you can train others in something like a training discord server with an accompanying map.\n\nImagine being able to do this all in a AAA game.\n\nHeres a [change.org](https:\/\/change.org\/) link to try to get it noticed\n\n[https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/rockstar-games-hell-let-loose-like-game-in-vr-a670cec3-4279-40a1-815b-65ecbf04d5ac?utm\\_content=starter\\_cl\\_share\\_content\\_en-us\\_7%3Av4&amp;recruiter=920694828&amp;utm\\_source=share\\_petition&amp;utm\\_medium=copylink&amp;utm\\_campaign=share\\_petition&amp;utm\\_term=G%3ESearch%3ESAP%3EUS%3ENonBrand%3EAll-Match-Types](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/rockstar-games-hell-let-loose-like-game-in-vr-a670cec3-4279-40a1-815b-65ecbf04d5ac?utm_content=starter_cl_share_content_en-us_7%3Av4&amp;recruiter=920694828&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=share_petition&amp;utm_term=G%3ESearch%3ESAP%3EUS%3ENonBrand%3EAll-Match-Types)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169825,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"God Tier WWII Game Idea","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/mg577k\/god_tier_wwii_game_idea\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"DeadProxy","author_created_utc":1400834476,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_gokro","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1616387738,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"maezyb","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"frequentlytopic loweffort automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":"Low effort |  New account | Question | automod","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_maezyb","no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/maezyb\/what_type_of_screws_go_into_htc_vive_20_trackers\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":"moderator","retrieved_utc":1623433722,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[removed]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169819,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"What type of screws go into HTC Vive 2.0 Trackers?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/maezyb\/what_type_of_screws_go_into_htc_vive_20_trackers\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}],"metadata":{"op_a":175,"op_b":76,"total":252},"error":null}
