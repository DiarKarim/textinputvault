I am not telling you the headset is better than any other, that is always going to vote down to your desired usage.\n\nFor me, I already have an Index and Reverb G2 and firmly entrenched in PCVR.  No interest in console and after those headsets couldn't downgrade visual and sound quality to consider Q2.  QP was too uncomfortable and awkward for me, better visuals than Q2 but l wasn't impressed for the money, \n\nI was looking for a headset that could fit the following:\n\n* PCVR wired\n* PCVR wireless\n* Mobile Mirroring VR\n* Standalone VR\n* Compact for Travel\/Flight Movie Watching\n* VR workspace in a pinch that was Viable\n* Viable Passthrough\n\nThat said the XR Elite was the closest from my estimation that fit the bill for me.  Since I was entrenched in PCVR the Facebook Meta library is a non factor for me and I have no doubt the library will fill for HTC.\n\nFor some critical categories for me:\n\nComfort: \n\nIt is light and once dialed in more comfortable than either of my other headsets but it took some effort to dial it in.  While not horrible for me, expect third party face gaskets will improve this.  I do find the full headset with pack much more comfortable.  The glasses arms are not long enough for me and, while tolerable, is not comfortable.  Also, the arms should rotate a bit to allow you to adjust the fit to your face better, especially in glasses mode.\n\nVisual Clarity:\n\nAs expected it is not as good as the Reverb G2 though not far off, but much better than index. For my eyes, noticeably better than the Q2, and on par with QP though to my eyes XR is touch more clear.  The one thing I did notice is light bleed of white text on dark backgrounds, this has been mentioned by others and can be bad in some cases.\n\nFOV:\n\nSeems roughly the same as QP, better than Q2, and definitely less than the G2 and Index, but honestly given the ease of use, lightness, and connection and overall performance with comparable (G2) or better visuals (Index) I feel for casual\/social gaming use it will likely be my daily driver despite less FOV.  To get more clarity\/resolution with large FOV it will require ridiculous hardware (like a $1.5-2k 4090) to run it so don't expect affordable rigs anytime soon. No scuba mask effect for me that others have suggested.\n\nSound:\n\nIt is better than I expected here.  Coming from Index and G2 it is no where near that but definitely better to my ears than Q2 and QP.  I did notice that at lower to mid volumes it sounds pretty decent but at higher volumes you start to notice an imbalance with bass lacking.  I was able to use BT headphones (Nuratrue Pros) to watch movies with no sync issues, worked beautifully.  I have not tried it with games yet though.  If there were sync issues, I wonder if BT 5.3 would help, don't know enough here to speak to this...maybe someone out there has more insight.\n\nPassthrough:\n\nThis was a bit more disappointing, clearer than any other but still not workable.  If you look at a screen with text that has white background from a distance looks just white until you move it very close to the headset.  Additionally everything looks oddly flat...depth sensor is still not enabled so we will see how it is in future.  Resolution is still not great but passthrough is better than any I have tried to date.\n\nHand Tracking:\n\nWork in progress.  It is workable with some gnashing of teeth along the way.  Also mostly available for menus and mirroring, not for many games at moment.  The menu gesture worked great for me, the pinching to click\/select often selected when I didn't pinch. Likely due to angle of camera to my hand so may take some learning on my part.\n\nSo how did XR Elite fare in each of my uses above?\n\nPCVR Wired:\n\nDownloaded the vive streaming app to PC, plugged in and up came my steam home and away I went into my library.  Demeo, Walkabout Minigolf, Alex and others all worked without issue or hitch.\n\nPCVR Wireless:  \n\nI did not get to try this properly, leaving for a trip, but was able to actually connect and start to play Walkabout with my PC wireless and the headset wireless on heavily shared wifi 5 but did get choppy quickly.  If I wired the PC to router expect this would have resolved this so very promising, sorry can't offer more here.\n\nMobile Mirroring:\n\nFor me this was easy to set up, download the manager, connected to same wifi, selected mirroring and it paired and just worked with my Samsung S22+. It was clear and responsive with no issues.  In landscape it really crunches your view and portrait seems unusually tall and thin but overall workable and watching movies was great in a non-noisy environment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStandalone VR:\n\nWorked great, visuals were better than I expected, but did not do much more that immersed, Cosmic Flow, and some other free options as leaving for a trip so didn't have much time. Others will undoubtedly be able to provide further insight here.  PCVR is my main use so not as vital for me.\n\nTravel\/ Flight Movies:\n\nUsed a MS Surface with streaming cable and worked just spectacularly.  Can't tell you how good this experience was especially with BT...don't bother with just headset speakers on a plane or other noisy environment as even at full volume you could barely hear the movie.  Also, movies via phone mirroring was not smooth, to stuttery\/lurchy, though sound with BT was good too.\n\nVirtual Workspaces:\n\nUsed Immerse for this and it is workable for sure.  Will not be as efficient as working with multiple screens in IRL yet to me but still investigating. Need to figure out if can do virtual screens in passthrough to use actual keyboard and mouse and simply have screens fixed in your space.  The resolution is not quite as sharp as I would like but working on the road it is definitely a viable option and could work for hours if I can sort out using actual mouse and keyboard.   \n\nPassthrough:\n\nDiscussed above, helpful but hope it improves with enabling of the depth sensor.  Resolution while better than any I have tried to date is still not great.  If AR is your thing there are better options.\n\nThere it is, hope it is helpful to some out there considering this headset.  For me this is the only one that ticked all the boxes for me to play my PCVR library but also be useful for Travel and have standalone with phone mirroring (compatible phones only).  HTC achieved a good balance with this headset and for someone new to VR who travels for work will be the best option out there in my opinion.  Hopefully they can improve on the glasses mode with longer arms and for future adjustable arms at the headset connection to allow for a better fit, but I am thrilled to see how the software improves seeing they are actively addressing many of issues people who had it early have reported.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177019,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"XR Elite Finally In Hand-Not perfect but Thrilled","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.92,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/1230s2e\/xr_elite_finally_in_handnot_perfect_but_thrilled\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Badelhas","author_created_utc":1434156200,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":"ascended","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"b86b93fa-6c37-11e9-8866-12b853345bae","author_flair_text":"new user|low karma account","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_o2r1u","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1675566260,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10tzafx","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"hdw automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10tzafx","no_follow":false,"num_comments":2,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/10tzafx\/controller_working_with_assetto_corsa\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678340105,"score":5,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I have a old XFX controller (I wish I had a wheel, of course) to play Assetto Corsa in VR.

You will see your hands and arms from the corner of your eyes while racing. This makes the racing experience more real, while also allowing you to get refreshments while driving.   \nClick the button \"Create Cockpit\" on the dashboard page to create a cockpit at the current headset position. You can move, rotate and resize the cockpit using VR controllers or keyboard.\n* **Keyboard Control**: You can now use the keyboard for moving and resizing the cockpit box and other camera boxes. If you only have a headset, without controllers, you can now use this app as well.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please reply here or on the [Steam Community](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1844610\/view\/3124940799694086449) forum.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177798,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Reality Mixer Update: Create Cockpit + Keyboard Control","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/tcrh8q\/reality_mixer_update_create_cockpit_keyboard\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"SushiiiCat007","author_created_utc":1598160252,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7ehmo4su","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1645574569,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"sz2k4b","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"gm viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"e739c54e-69ac-11e5-8479-0e313743e45f","link_flair_text":"Gaming","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_sz2k4b","no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/sz2k4b\/jei_not_working_with_vivecraft\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654101597,"retrieved_utc":1654101597,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Playing 1.12.2 Ftb Stoneblock 2, runs fine but, JEI keyboard won't open and i can't see the recipes for the items when i try to click on them in the inventory.

If you want to use a PC keyboard in VR, it will use the camera only when you look at the keyboard, not when you are looking the other way or if you are at the other end of your play space.\n\nYou can bring several objects into VR in a non-intrusive way. The objects will fade out and disappear when you are not nearby.  \nImagine how useful it is to see your desk in VR, or a chair, a couch or the doorway. It works with **all SteamVR games**.  \nIf you like **SIM racing**, how about seeing your real **racing wheel** in VR, or a **HOTAS**.  \nIf you do streaming from VR, you can use the app to see an **Elgato Stream Deck** or Touch Portal in your VR world.\n\nThe app is currently in *Early Access* on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1844610\/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_Vive_and_Index\/). This means it is available now, while it is developed further.\n\nSome new features that will be implemented include:\n\n* Green screening \/ chroma keying. E.g. put a green screen behind the racing wheel or HOTAS to hide the area surrounding the wheel or HOTAS.\n* Attach an object to a Vive or Tundra Tracker to move a pocket of reality through the VR world. E.g. attach a tracker to a wireless keyboard to use and see it in VR while sitting on a couch.\n\nIf you have ideas for additional features, please reach out.\n\nTake a look at the [Steam page

You might have seen my  stuff. I maintain an \u201cacab\u201d Great Games\/Software list that I recommend  checking out, as well as a guide to getting into VR from scratch with  what headset to get and PC components. And an explainer about how the  Index is an AR headset and how you can test it out; either the community  or Valve, ideally both, will turn that into a real use case. And just  generally things against the lumbering monolith of world-eating soulless  corpos that is Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nI  made this guide to help people feel more comfortable and reduce  friction in VR. It\u2019s also supposed to make you fully acquainted with  SteamVR settings, how to use things like Desktop view so you don't have  to take off your headset, how to get into VR quickly, and some addons  you should use. Always look for ways to do the things you want to do in  VR or can't do right now. There\u2019s a tool called Aardvark that some  community people and a valve person or two are trying to get going, that  could make being inside VR a lot less clunky by creating a really great  way to make apps and gadgets that run over VR\/AR and can communicate  between users and each other, basically a whole app economy would become  possible.\n\n# Set up\n\nSteamVR's  set up process is pretty straightforward, but some notes: You have to  redo your room set up if you take down your base stations or move them  around. Sometimes tracking will still work the same if you move your  base stations, but the guardians will be completely messed up (someone  turned one of my base stations 45 degrees and I didn't notice until I  slammed into a wall). There is no way to do the room set up in-headset  in passthrough yet, but when you have to make your boundaries click  \"advanced mode\" and you just have to mark the four corners of your play  space.\n\nMake sure you have  powercycling on so the base stations turn on and off with the headset.  You can set up base stations either at waist level just sitting on  tables (2.0 only), on tall camera stands, or on the wall. If they are  ever moved they do need to do room set up again. If you set them up on  the wall you probably can just unplug the cord on both ends and take it  out again when you need it.\n\nYour  PC's startup can be quick and easy if you boot your OS off an SSD and  turn off password login in windows. You can add a headless monitor plug  if you want to move your computer around without a monitor or TV so that  you still have desktop view.\n\nThe  way I use VR is that I walk into the room, I press the power button on  my PC (monitor left off), I walk over to my Index and click the button  on the bottom (this turns on steamVR as long as Steam is running), put  it on, and I\u2019m in VR. I turn on 3D passthrough (double-click the button  on the headset) to pick up my controllers, then turn passthrough off  after I launch a game. I turned SteamVR Home off and you should too (see  below).\n\n# SteamVR\n\nSteamVR  starts when you press the system button on your headset, as long as  steam is open. You can also just right click the steam icon in the icon  bar or pin SteamVR to the taskbar. For opening games, I either use the  dashboard, which isn't ideal because it only shows your recently played  games, or I use icons on my PC desktop\/the desktop steam interface.\n\nSteam  Big Picture mode is always accessible in VR. Click your library button  on the dashboard and then \u201cbrowse all\u201d to see your whole Steam library,  and click back to the Big Picture home to use things like Steam Chat and  invite people\/join their games.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u0fg0d1jdyr51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3fcd11fd19e8ab5e539b1c95ceb47cd34665f2](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/u0fg0d1jdyr51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b3fcd11fd19e8ab5e539b1c95ceb47cd34665f2)\n\nThe Tutorial is a little portal  themed tutorial Valve originally made for the Vive. Resetting Seated  Position is for when you want to sit somewhere other than the room  center and the game doesn't have a setting for that. Display VR view  brings up the VR mirror of steamVR, which includes things like overlays  running on top of the game and your passthrough (if you\u2019re a streamer  you can use it to show your room to your audience easily) (if you're  showing someone VR then turn this on because it will show you exactly  what they see including any bugs or if they open the dashboard), and if  you select the \u201cboth eyes\u201d mode it works better than any generic in game  one but there is a slight performance cost. Devices is where you can  pair controllers and power-manage your base stations so they turn on and  off with your headset. **It also lets you restart SteamVR, even from inside the HMD.** Workshop is mostly for SteamVR home environments. Settings is what we're focused on here.\n\n# SteamVR Settings\n\n*Do  this on the desktop to make it easier for you. On the little steamVR  box click the three lines and then \u201csettings\u201d to open the settings UI.  Do it right now while you read the guide if you want, your headset  should be idle and not rendering if you're not wearing it.*\n\n[*https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wktik73ldyr51.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0d56830ac7943b51ba9145c486aa148c576653*](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wktik73ldyr51.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0d56830ac7943b51ba9145c486aa148c576653)\n\nTurn on advanced settings in the left  corner. Then take a look at what\u2019s in the general settings. Refresh  rate, brightness, render resolution, etc are obvious. Click from \u201cauto\u201d  to \u201ccustom\u201d on the resolution if you don\u2019t want it to change the  resolution when you change frame rate. Notifications means you can turn  in-headset steam notifications on and off.\n\n**At the bottom there is an option for SteamVR Home. If you don\u2019t use it I would definitely turn it off s**ince I don\u2019t like running a graphically intensive outdated program when I\u2019m not doing anything.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f83ngr2mdyr51.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=234678395e36fcca9dd86ae352126800a06a14ff](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/f83ngr2mdyr51.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=234678395e36fcca9dd86ae352126800a06a14ff)\n\nNext click on play area. I use a medium grid or squares chaperone, and I  set the color to white. I also have a low activation distance but set  yours at the right distance for what you need. I remove the play area  floor by making it invisible since it isn\u2019t necessary and doesn't cover  the whole floor anyway. Choose the white background if you hate glare.  Toggle on the floor bounds if you always want to always be able to see  where your boundaries end while you're playing, useful if you want to  use roomscale movement as much as possible.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/034fnb8odyr51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17aaaf15bef73c3918f0236ed5c9811ef4115cda](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/034fnb8odyr51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17aaaf15bef73c3918f0236ed5c9811ef4115cda)\n\nNext click on dashboard in the menu  list. I would set \u201cshow desktop tab\u201d to \u201coff\u201d if you\u2019re going to use an  app like desktop+ to replace your desktop view. Each option reduces what  a user inside the headset can do, which is useful for when you're  showing the headset to someone and don't want them to get confused,  including making the system button do nothing so they don't accidentally  activate it. You\u2019ll still be able to go into your SteamVR settings on  the desktop and change it back. Dashboard position does what it says, so  bring it closer if you can't see clearly or further away if you want  more room to use the laser pointer.\n\nI address the controller bindings topic at the end.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ax87xxrodyr51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2592eee3227a2bf790d2ce713e2c285df613708](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ax87xxrodyr51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2592eee3227a2bf790d2ce713e2c285df613708)\n\nIn the video menu there are a lot of  the same options as the general tab. Make sure \u201cfade to grid on app  hang\u201d is on, and at the button where it says \"pause VR while headset is  idle\" you may want to make sure that is on. Overlay render quality  shouldn't really matter, the dashboard uses almost no resources.  You  can change your refresh rate during gameplay in every game except Half  Life Alyx, which requires a restart. You can change resolution while a  game is running but some may require you to restart it.\n\nRender  resolution basically works by either being set to \"auto,\" where SteamVR  picks a resolution based on your refresh rate and GPU and \"custom,\"  where you choose the value. If you want to keep your resolution when you  change your refresh rate, keep it on custom. I play Pistol Whip at  144hz with the same 144% super sampling I use at 90hz in games. Having  something like fpsVR makes it really easy to tell what settings work for  you.\n\nThe bar that says \u201cper  application video settings'' is very useful. What this does is allow you  to add a resolution modifier for a specific game that is always applied  to that game (whatever your default resolution is, times the modifier),  and you can change the \u201cmotion smoothing\u201d setting. Here\u2019s an example of  that in action: In Pavlov matches with 40-50 people, both the CPU and  GPU frametimes tank and fluctuate a lot. So what I do is that I set my  index to 120hz, and then I turn motion smoothing to \u201cforce always on.\u201d  That means the game only tries to render 60 frames and fake frames fill  in the rest. There\u2019s artifacting but it\u2019s smooth. In games that are CPU  bound this is also important since you can't just lower the resolution  and fix it. During a game you can click \"video settings\" on the  dashboard and and it'll bring up these settings too.\n\nTurning  off motion smoothing just changes how reprojection works. Motion  smoothing is when it switches to running at half framerate and fills in  the other half, where the old reprojection method was only replacing the  frames you were missing, and only compensating for head rotation, which  could look choppier.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/17kkvx1qdyr51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7c86204641fc25575c7f7e4e28ac712796e2939](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/17kkvx1qdyr51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f7c86204641fc25575c7f7e4e28ac712796e2939)\n\nIn the audio menu you can change your input and output devices. This  could be useful if you want to use RTX voice (uses GPU power to  eliminate any background noise), since it appears as a separate  microphone. You can mirror audio if you\u2019re showing a game off to people,  and you can turn on output from both the speakers and something plugged  into the 3.5mm audio hack.  **I recommend you install** [**EarTrumpet**](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/eartrumpet\/9nblggh516xp?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab)**,** a windows app that makes it quick and easy to adjust the volume of different apps separately without extra menus.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ul5w0nlqdyr51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=912caa714eb76670dc610148640ddeff56e6a3ea](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ul5w0nlqdyr51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=912caa714eb76670dc610148640ddeff56e6a3ea)\n\nFor cameras, turn on 3D room view.  Then room view has a few options from clear ghosts to opaque  passthrough, I use opaque passthrough to just see the world but you can  make it less obvious. The reason you would do that is that \u201cshow camera  at room edge\u201d makes the passthrough come on when you step close to the  boundaries. This is good for showing it off to new people but is a  little slow, so you might want to go back to dashboard and adjust how  close you need to be to trigger the walls.\n\nIf you have Natural Locomotion installed, it breaks your camera, just so you know.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g5gs277rdyr51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58333c2860212d80824303679c445752862f3b39](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g5gs277rdyr51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58333c2860212d80824303679c445752862f3b39)\n\nStartup is important. You can change which apps steamVR starts up with.  You don\u2019t have to have revive enabled here to actually use revive, it  just turns off the library button. You can also stop other apps like  Desktop+, metachromium, and fpsVR from starting with steamVR at launch  if you want.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n7j8dgordyr51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795c84dc8dba255d86f23beb4dbf7b9534257e3c](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/n7j8dgordyr51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=795c84dc8dba255d86f23beb4dbf7b9534257e3c)\n\nThe only \u201cdeveloper\u201d tab setting you  might want is to enable \u201cshow GPU performance\u201d for a few minutes because  it shows a graph on your face of your GPU frametimes, making it easy to  see how your setting decisions affect performance. But fpsVR works  better for this.\n\n# SteamVR Add-Ons\n\n# [Desktop+](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9kj303wtdyr51.jpg?width=1189&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4decda4bcea61e89a47b3e5573bdae2dd5647d76](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9kj303wtdyr51.jpg?width=1189&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4decda4bcea61e89a47b3e5573bdae2dd5647d76)\n\nThis is a leaner, better version of  the SteamVR desktop mirror. It also adds a keyboard that lets you do  things like click \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cshift\u201d and then another key so you can  copy and paste even when you can\u2019t right click.\n\n**You  can pin windows in your playspace or relative to your hand, and keep  using and clicking on them when the dashboard is closed, plus you can  spawn a keyboard to use still inside your game.**\n\nOne  particularly useful feature is that it adds a task switcher which you  can just click to tab out of the game you\u2019re in. Lots of games load  fullscreen and basically block you from doing anything else at the same  time.  Windows 10 now lets you not just tab out, but make a whole  separate desktop by pressing WIN+TAB, this lets you have a game full  screen but your monitor just sees your desktop and anything new you do.  This is what Desktop+ uses for its window switcher and it's great. This  makes it easy to use discord, look something up, go on twitter during  downtime, etc. It\u2019s useful to not feel as limited in VR.\n\n# [fpsVR](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/908520\/fpsVR\/)\n\nThen  there is fpsVR, sold on steam for $4. This has a lot of settings (and  likely inspired some of Valve\u2019s improvements to SteamVR after the index  came out). Of note are a few things.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xsx3tnjudyr51.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5944c6de8a9df0b4e1dae3fac655c978741864](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xsx3tnjudyr51.jpg?width=399&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb5944c6de8a9df0b4e1dae3fac655c978741864)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5j8inaoudyr51.jpg?width=743&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76aee5ab110068f0abf911daab33bacb9a789d23](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5j8inaoudyr51.jpg?width=743&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76aee5ab110068f0abf911daab33bacb9a789d23)\n\nThis  is the biggest one, you can\n\n* Add an overlay next to your hand that shows  your GPU and CPU frametimes, temps, a clock, etc. It\u2019s essential to  choosing settings in games and always makes it easy to see if you\u2019re  dropping frames and why. I always use this and have it attached to my  left wrist.\n* You  can change the motion smoothing setting to always on more easily, right  there where it says \u201cmotion smoothing,\u201d click and then you should see  the options. This applies to all apps until you change it back.\n* It  adds \u201cdesktop utilities\u201d to the normal steam desktop view, which is  useful if you don\u2019t want to use Desktop+, because you can press the alt  tab macro and see the desktop.\n* You  can set a center marker. You can also have the center marker track the  tangling of your headset so you can untangle it without taking it off.  You can also have the marker follow you so it doesn\u2019t show the center  but also lets you see which way is forward or how tangled you are by  just looking at your feet.\n* You  can tweak your play space if needed, tweak the floor, add a beeping  warning when people get close to the edges, have the edges get really  obvious if you get really close, or hide all chaperones.\n* Can  be useful if you sometimes sit on a couch on the edge of your playspace  and want all chaperones gone. In utilities you can show or hide the  steamVR mirror from within the headset. And six, you can restart SteamVR  if something is borked without taking off the headset, the headset will  turn off and then back on.\n\n# [OVR Advanced Settings](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1009850\/OVR_Advanced_Settings\/)\n\nThis  enables a lot of niche functions and tweaks. It's free on github and  Steam. If you have accessibility\/mobility concerns I recommend looking  into it. They have a discord, so head there if you need it for those  reason and they'll probably help you out.\n\n# Using your desktop in VR\n\nYou  can always access the desktop through your system menu button, the one  that brings up the steam dashboard. Trigger is left click and thumbpad  is right click. Don't be afraid to use this function. I use it to go  online, download something, unzip it, and then launch it in VR without  taking off the headset. The replacement keyboard from Desktop+ helps a  lot.\n\nWhen you use an overlay like  Desktop+ or fpsVR to add the ability to tab out of the VR game\u2019s desktop  window, you can do most of the things you need to do. Opening discord, a  browser, even watch youtube videos, whatever, probably isn\u2019t going to  affect your performance unless the game is really CPU bound.\n\nIf  you want a second or third monitor in VR, you need to buy a headless  monitor, because of how Windows works. It's just a cheap dummy monitor  plug that tells windows it's a 4K 60hz monitor or whatever.  Desktop+  and a few other programs like Virtual Desktop let you use them at the  same time.\n\nFor what it's worth, I  always turn on the passthrough when I use the desktop view, it feels  more comfortable and always runs underneath the dashboard or overlays.\n\n# Frame Throttling\n\nThis  is helpful for when a game just can't hit framerate and seems to move  up and down. Like MS Flight Simulator or some pavlov custom servers with  a lot of people. You can set your refresh rate higher, or leave it, and then force on motion smoothing. It keeps your framerate smooth rather than bouncing around.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i3xo0ba3nev61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b461f56e279df3c1348b5b9988b50dd0b4f855](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i3xo0ba3nev61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b461f56e279df3c1348b5b9988b50dd0b4f855)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l698qd48nev61.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba2e88c6e55a58969f4e7959d7a66a56978cc8ff](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/l698qd48nev61.png?width=520&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba2e88c6e55a58969f4e7959d7a66a56978cc8ff)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bdbg9v57a4c71.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efd249242f47da2b1365fc0fb0c06533f10fb4e4](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bdbg9v57a4c71.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efd249242f47da2b1365fc0fb0c06533f10fb4e4)\n\n# Controller Bindings\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yekcntfxdyr51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317ccce0783025a92553566e4a9ba5b2063220b7](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yekcntfxdyr51.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=317ccce0783025a92553566e4a9ba5b2063220b7)\n\nIn the controllers menu, you can  manage controller bindings even when not in an app, although that  doesn\u2019t always work. I recommend starting up a game or piece of software  with the headset off, then making your custom bindings on your monitor.  Again, just click into your steamVR settings on the desktop with mouse  and keyboard.\n\nThis whole system is  glitchy and sometimes just doesn't work, and some games don't support  it at all so you have to literally map one button to another rather than  a specific function. But it also allows you a lot of control. Like you  can make something actuate faster by changing how much the trigger or  grab needs to be held down before it actuates. But I also cannot make a  full guide to how this system works because I actually don't understand  every function it has.\n\nTwo uses I  found for example, were changing mag release in some games to pressing  down on the thumbpad, or in H3 I run whenever my off hand is squeezing  down. It's a useful system. TTS is one game that benefited from  completely redoing the controls myself in this system. If a game doesn't  use the thumbpad, I recommend taking a look at what you can rebind it  to do; the thumbpad can work as one button, two buttons, or four  buttons.\n\n# Field of View and World Scale\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/39mr4rvn14c71.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc42e31a39e2c9c99ca0fbb9445f89250e0b3ef7](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/39mr4rvn14c71.png?width=549&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc42e31a39e2c9c99ca0fbb9445f89250e0b3ef7)\n\nYou can change the field of view, which squeezes the same number of  pixels into less space for a more dense image. This can cause some culling issues (objects popping in and out)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/79qh03u624c71.png?width=541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b256fa41e67d23defda2925954df22c2ab395411](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/79qh03u624c71.png?width=541&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b256fa41e67d23defda2925954df22c2ab395411)\n\n# [Reshade CAS](https:\/\/github.com\/fholger\/reshade\/releases)\n\nReshade  is a tool using AMD tech that slightly sharpens the image and improves  the colors with little to no performance cost. I recommend using it,  especially on an LCD headset. You can press the END key to toggle it on  and off without taking off the headset. You copy the files in the  reshade download and paste them next the game's exe.\n\n[Here's a running list of games that work.](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1WJ91v_tCZE3mvGASbbUyWV4ijcskEP11QrdSWuiVAxs\/htmlview)\n\n# [AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution](https:\/\/github.com\/tappi287\/openvr_fsr_app)\n\nThis  lets you render a game at a lower resolution and it upsamples back to  normal, to save on the GPU load. You can also use foveated rendering on  some games, I recommend [using this app](https:\/\/github.com\/tappi287\/openvr_fsr_app) to make enabling it and disabling it easy.\n\n# [HoloSwitch](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1183720\/Holoswitch\/)\n\nHoloswitch  is an app that lets you bring android notifications into VR. It also  lets you watch a camera feed inside VR from an external camera.\n\nThe  most interesting feature to me is that you can take videos inside of  VR. It adds a watch on your hand that appears when you look at it that  lets you start recording. It also captures the overlay layer, including  desktop mirrors, the dashboard, and passthrough. This is much easier  than using the steamVR mirror to get everything. It does hurt  performance a little when you're recording.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cewzp1qpa4c71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eaf63aaf25cad2724f0b64aa901b5fc6b419f7f](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cewzp1qpa4c71.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eaf63aaf25cad2724f0b64aa901b5fc6b419f7f)\n\n# [Stop Sign VR](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1196450\/Stop_Sign_VR\/)\n\nThis  app was made to let you trace over an object to make a box that stops  you from walking into it. Like internal boundaries in your space with a  lot of options. They also added a few other features like another room  boundary system, audio cues, fade in boxes, and you can actually have  one of these boxes show the fpsVR performance monitor and turn to face  you. **If you're on WMR, you should get this since it will give you a much better room boundaries system.**\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cb7cjqo35hm61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde52bf0496371194e1a93370e769fd3bc5d4b7a](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cb7cjqo35hm61.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde52bf0496371194e1a93370e769fd3bc5d4b7a)\n\n# [Pluto](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/389980\/Pluto\/)\n\nPluto  is basically Facetime in VR. You can call someone and they'll appear as  a roomscale avatar in your playspace on top of whatever game you have  running or your passthrough. You don't see each other's game's but you  can talk to each other without having some whole dedicated app just to  talk to them. They're working on tools that would let you do things like  draw together, share screens, etc too. The reviews on steam are  negative because it used to be hard to turn off if it was set to start  with steam. Those issues seem to be resolved and uninstalling it is the  same as anything else on steam.\n\n# [MetaChromium](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/685110\/Metachromium\/)\n\nMetachromium is a WebXR browser that lets you run WebXR on top of VR games, or on top of passthrough. Some examples you could check out are: [Plockle](https:\/\/plockle.com\/), a Cubism style puzzle game that's easy to play on top of other games (disable the background from its menu). [VARTISTE](https:\/\/zach-geek.gitlab.io\/vartiste\/#), a painting app that lets you paint on canvas or 3D models. [MoonRider](https:\/\/moonrider.xyz\/), a Beat Saber clone made by the community that has all the community maps. Basically any WebXR app where you can turn off the background or that doesn't have one.\n\n# [Reality Mixer](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1844610\/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_Vive_and_Index\/)\n\nReality Mixer lets you trace a real life object and see it in your game. You could trace your mouse and keyboard to make them easier to use with an HMD on. You can mark your door or couch to see other people while you play. Or an object you want to avoid in your play space.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qgdpxkvxebf81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893018abb7db29bced147570e81e39e73b763dde](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qgdpxkvxebf81.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=893018abb7db29bced147570e81e39e73b763dde)\n\n# The Frunk\n\nJust  realized that this might need a mention. The Index Frunk has had a few  interesting mods for it but largely has gone unused. But I have a few  uses for it.\n\n1. You  can use a gamepad or anything else USB by plugging it into the headset.  I would assume this also lowers latency, so for seated VR it can be  nice, or when playing a VR game standing with a gamepad\/VorpX in VR.\n2. Sometimes  I play TTS with only one controller, so it works really well if I have  my controller plugged into the headset and charging. You might be able  to get an adapter to charge both. Valve doesn't recommend doing this if  you're whipping your arms around so you don't damage the usb-c port.\n3. Attachments  like a leap motion with a little USB-C to A adapter fits inside easily.  Some people have used it to hold fans or dedicated fan attachments,  even a keypad, or to store candy.\n\nThe  Vive has a free USB slot on top as well, where the strap connects to  the headset and all the cables attach. I used to plug my leap motion in  there.\n\n*I  really hope I can remake this guide in six months or a year and also  talk about new features Valve adds, or Aardvark gadgets that remove  clunk and friction\/add functions to SteamVR.*","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":177803,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"How to Use SteamVR (Guide)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.89,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/sia9vn\/how_to_use_steamvr_guide\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Alexopfpz","author_created_utc":1553634988,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3hjqqcnp","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1643481795,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1643483951.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"sfom5k","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"gm automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_sfom5k","no_follow":false,"num_comments":64,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/sfom5k\/any_cool_vr_games_where_you_can_fly_a_spaceship\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654147317,"retrieved_utc":1654147317,"score":29,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hi, I'm just looking for cool vr sci-fi games where you can also (possibly not entirely) fly some cool spaceships lol.

hi there.  \nIs this application still relevant? Heck if I know. Didn't stop me from working on it.  \nThis version is one that was kinda never supposed to be released, but it's been almost 8 months since the last stable release, so bundling up all the small beta changes once again makes sense, I suppose.\n\nFor those who need an introduction to the app:  \nDesktop+ is a free desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.  \nSteamVR's built-in desktop overlay has gotten better at this stuff somewhat, but I believe Desktop+ still has a place for those who need a bit more from their overlays.\n\nAs for why this version was never supposed to be released, more about that at the end.\n\nFirst, here's what's new in Desktop+ 2.6:\n\n**New:**  \n\n- Added Seated Position overlay origin  \nThis origin follows the seated tracking universe position and adjusts overlays automatically when the seated position changes. Keep in mind this is only useful when running applications using the seated tracking space (not to be confused with the standing-only position).  \nWhen the standing tracking space is active, SteamVR may move the seated position in an inconvenient spot, so make sure to configure overlays while the seated tracking space is active.\n- Added Gaze Fade target opacity setting  \nThis setting controls the opacity it fades towards. If this is set higher than the overlay's opacity, it inverts the Gaze Fade behavior (fading in when looking away).\n- Added separate maximum distance setting for Global HMD-Pointer\n- Horizontal stick\/touchpad scroll input during overlay drag now adjusts the width of the overlay\n- The yellow border around desktops and windows when using Graphics Capture is now disabled if supported (requires Windows 11)\n- Performance Monitor now displays headset battery levels if available\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Improved accuracy of the Performance Monitor FPS counter and enabled FPS display while no VR application is running\n- Improved input simulation compatibility with games using DirectInput for keyboard input (e.g. Skyrim)\n- Increased Floating UI fade-out delay &amp; doubled it for curved overlays\n- Controllers can no longer toggle overlay interaction if they're used as the overlay's origin\n- Window overlay focus changes are no longer triggered while drag or select mode is active\n- A non-Steam restart of Desktop+ is now attempted when the Steam restart failed\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fixed CPU &amp; GPU performance counters not working in desktop mode\n- Fixed FPS being displayed as 0 in Performance Monitor when only reprojected frames are shown\n- Fixed toggling drag-mode desyncing current overlay state between UI and main process\n- Fixed race condition when adding several Graphics Capture overlays at once (on startup or by loading a profile)\n- Fixed UI dimming setting not being saved and restored correctly\n- Fixed wrong icon variant being used in some places for the combined desktop overlay icon\n- Fixed Global HMD-Pointer not switching between overlays unless there was a gap between them\n- Fixed Global HMD-Pointer desyncing current overlay state between UI and main process\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/5521971008767625720).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\n**Progress on the new UI**\n\nI've seemingly always promised to tackle usability concerns at some point, so I've been busy actually fulfilling that promise. The original plan was to drop it all in one big release... but it turned out to take way longer than anticipated. Oh well.  \nHowever, progress has been made over time and I've been quietly releasing preview builds on Steam and GitHub without making a big deal out them over here. With the NewUI Preview 3 build I think it's gotten to the point of at least being worth mentioning, though.  \nWhile obviously not stable, I consider NewUI Preview 3 to have a decent amount of features now. Good enough for daily use if one's fine with some stuff still missing.\n\nAnd the new UI is not just the same thing in green either, it comes with its own set of new stuff alongside making the old work better:\n\n- Floating settings windows (can be moved anywhere and pinned to use outside of dashboard)\n- Translation support (currently ships with English &amp; German)\n- Fully custom keyboard (layouts are user-definable, currently ships with US-QWERTY &amp; German QWERTZ, also improved input simulation)\n- Custom laser pointer (non-blocking input outside of dashboard, multi-laser input on keyboard)\n- Overlay Bar (better overlay management)\n- Window listing\/management improvements (window state tracking, auto-hiding\/restoration)\n- Better overlay creation (directly select source, drag window out of desktop overlay, get active window from Floating UI)\n- Auto-docking\n- Better Floating UI design (works with any curvature setting)\n- ...and more, probably\n\nThe announcement posts for each New UI Preview build comes with more details, including small video clips, if you want to know more: [Preview 1](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/2984183718087120350), [Preview 2](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/2888485959670010355), [Preview 3](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/5521971008786221043).  \nThis is where my focus has been on recently, so I hope you at least check the clips out. Thank you.\n\nDesktop+ is a free and open-source project I'm working on in my spare time. If you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).\n\nI believe that's it.

Like many of you I pre-ordered very early on directly from HTC to take advantage of the $50 discount and when the 3rd of June rolled around I was expecting a \"your order has shipped\" email, midway through the day I contacted HTC customer support to inquire about the status of the order and was told that they didn't know when it would ship. Someone on here reported that their 11 May pre-order (which predated my pre-order by two days) had an ETA of June 15. At that same point in time someone on here suggested that B&amp;H had VP2 in stock and with customer service chat still open I cancelled my pre-order and ordered from them with standard shipping (free). To my delight it arrived yesterday. \n\nThe day before yesterday, in anticipation for the new headset, I installed a 3rd Valve Lighthouse 2.0 as I have a blind area near my kitchen (roughly 3x4 meter play area going by SteamVR but it's larger in actuality) and I'm glad I did so as it made the return to a proper SteamVR HMD that much more glorious. \n\n**Backstory** \n\nI picked up an Index early last year and sold it after \"upgrading\" to the Reverb G2, while retaining the Lighthouses and Knuckles controllers. I have had nothing but problems with the Reverb G2. I don't know where the problems ultimately originate from, but WMR is seriously Games for Windows Live level garbage-ware. Before picking up a PCI-E USB card my G2 would lock up my PC 80% of the time, necessitating a hard reboot, and 5-6 of WMR and \/or the G2 locking up my PC would result in Windows needing to be repaired. This happened not once, not twice, but three times. Luckily I always keep a system image on hand for stuff like this but yeah. Also, WMR would \"forget\" WMR Boundary, meaning, I had to spend 10 minutes walking around my room 2-3 times as the first time would never result in an accurate representation of my play area. Redoing Boundary means redoing the Knuckles controller calibration via SpaceCal, at one point I was doing this on a weekly basis. And the Knuckles controllers would never track properly, there would be some kind of weird drift where if you stood in one place and did a 360 the controllers would perceptibly move a few inches and this would get progressively worse during any play session where eventually your virtual hands in game would be 6 inches below or above or to the side of your controllers. \n\nThere was also some kind of camera tracking induced jitter while walking around, either moving around in a virtual playspace, or using Natural Locomotion for movement (I love playing HL:A with NaLo + Vive trackers on ankle bracelets). Eventually I learned to walk softly as this is immersion destroying. \n\nThe G2 speaker arms constantly needed to have their screws tightened otherwise just head movement would cut the sound to one or the other speakers and there is an established problem with the G2 where speaker volume above 85% would cause the displays to go black with explosions (100% reproducible in The Lab &gt; Fort Defense when shooting an explosive barrel). \n\nThe G2 did have acceptable FOV after swapping the default face gasket for an 18mm pad, and I had a 98 HFOV and 90 VFOV up from 89 and 85 with the factory face-plate. \n\nI had numerous other issues, including a problem while playing Assetto Corsa Competizione where the worldview would slowly flip upside down followed by both screens turning blue. This happened on avg. once every hour or so, and if you were in a multiplayer race it was game over. \n\nI had so many frustrating moments with this headset, so many profanity filled evenings where I'm sure I alarmed my neighbors. It was truly the biggest piece of shit hardware I've ever owned in my entire life and I will never buy another HP product nor WMR headset. \n\nSo I was READY to upgrade to ANYTHING and had put considerable research in Pimax's 8KX as a potential alternative but decided against that as for one, I have a large nose and people with large noses have issues with Pimax HMD's, Pimax 8KX is a lot of pixels to drive and still retain G2 level of clarity, even for someone with a water-cooled RTX 3090, and there were concerns about comfort, audio, and Pimax customer support. \n\nExpectations: So I waited and out of the blue HTC announced the Vive Pro 2. At first I was excited, especially after reading and watching Sebastian Ang's review. So I pulled the trigger very early on. Then, within the past few weeks, it was one mixed or outright negative review after another, starting with VoodooDE's review, and followed up with a plethora of negative reviews here. At one point I seriously considered returning my order but part of me just wanted to satisfy my curiosity and BOY AM I GLAD I DID. \n\n**First Impressions**\n\nMy first impression of the VP2 was how well it is put together coming from the G2. The cable attachment and management is elegant and functional. The padding on the rear is robust and comfortable. The headphones are sturdy and produce a satisfying click as you adjust them about their hinges. Right out of the box I had a Kiwi HTC Vive Pro face-pad on it as I wanted to really maximize the FOV wow factor coming from the G2. Many have stated that it's like going from 4:3 to 16:9 and I would actually go so far as to say it's like going from 4:3 to near 21:9. The clarity to my eyes feels the same as the G2 except there is fairly moderate glare from anything that is white on the screen which does hamper the clarity slightly. The sweetspot feels slightly smaller than the G2 but still good. The heat is about the same as the G2. \n\nBut I am not doing this review any justice, I need to attempt to put into words the feeling of firing up SteamVR Home for the first time @ 120 Hz with the FOV increase and perfect lighthouse tracking without needing to calibrate the controllers. It was absolutely otherwordly coming from the G2. Also, the colors, blacks and contrast, my god THE BLACKS, I can't believe this is LCD! Last night I was playing TWD: Saints and Sinners and I had this feeling of presence that induced a certain feeling of dread that I just didn't have in the G2 @ 90 Hz and 4:3 FOV with mediocre blacks and contrast. There was a lit torch outside of a bus that I stopped and admired as it felt like I was looking at an HDR panel in terms of contrast. \n\n**Audio** \n\nGoing by the reviews and complaints here I was ready for really bad audio. To my PLEASANT surprise the audio is not only acceptable (I find it to be on par with Index only lacking in mids and bass, but the treble is better than G2 \/ Index nearfield speakers) but as pointed out here by another reviewer, YOU HAVE ISOLATION FROM LIGHTHOUSE WHINE. I didn't realize how important this is until using these headphones. The lighthouses emit an incredibly annoying high pitched whine that you absolutely can hear with both the G2 and Index. Not so in the VP2. For this reason I am actually going to say that the audio sounded BETTER than the off-ear offerings of the G2 and Index. Combined with the 100% total complete light blocking (with the G2 a face-pad velcroed to the HMD has many light-leak sources, although the nose-peak can be considered a tradeoff). Also, the volume button is a god-send. I found the VP2 to be VERY loud at only 80% volume and having the ability to turn the volume up or down depending on the title or situation without having to use SteamVR UI is really really nice, extremely underrated. I am going to actually go against the trend here and say that the audio solution is an improvement over the G2 and Index. With the VP2 you have excellent light insulation and the sound isolation really takes that to the next level, and drowning out basestation whine, I can't place enough emphasis on how amazing this is. \n\n**Comfort** \n\nVersus G2: \n\nI hope I don't sound biased at this point, but even being heavier the VP2 trades blows with the Reverb G2 from a comfort stand-point. For one, the HMD fits much better on the face, I don't know how to put it, I don't know if it's the arc of the HMD itself but I find the point where the HMD meets my face to feel better with the VP2. The VP2 is also balanced, it does not feel front-heavy. The adjustment knob makes tightening the HMD much easier. With the G2, as with the Index, there are many times throughout any given play session where I feel the need to fiddle with the top and side adjustment straps, whether it's because the foam has become compressed or the desire to open up a slight gap above the cheekbones to allow airflow in, with the G2, aside from the top-strap, making adjustments to the side-straps is so cumbersome that I usually just deal with whatever issue I have, be it unwarranted pressure on my cheekbones etc. With the VP2 making adjustments to the distance of the HMD with the dial is simple and ergonomic. \n\nUltimately the G2 gets a slight win here but only because of it's 500g weight and I do mean ever so slight win here. \n\nVersus Index\n\nVP2 is more comfortable than the Index hands down. This has to do with the VP2 having greater 50\/50 weight distribution front to rear. Yes, it's 830g, but ask most if not all Index owners and many will tell you the Index wasn't comfortable over long sessions until they, like myself, added a counterweight. I had to use StudioForm's 200g counterweight on my Index to get it to have the same weight distribution as the VP2, bringing total weight up from 799g to 999g or roughly 170g heavier than the VP2. \n\nThe cable is also much more flexible, thinner and lighter than the G2 (I measured). \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/h7pntl\/why\\_weight\\_review\\_of\\_studioform\\_creatives\\_index\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/h7pntl\/why_weight_review_of_studioform_creatives_index\/)\n\nReverb G2: 500g \/ 1.1 lbs\n\nVive Pro 2: 830g \/ 1.829 lbs\n\nIndex with counterweight: 2.2 lbs \n\n**Heat** \n\nThe VP2 @ 120 Hz, to my disbelief, feels as warm \/ cool as the G2 @ 90 Hz. This may have something to do with their being slightly less brightness, not sure. Both the VP2 and G2 are considerably cooler than the Index. In fact, I could not use the Index without a frunk fan. The VP2 and G2 feel almost as cool as the Index with Frunk fan. \n\n**Visuals**\n\nMy first observation was that the VP2 felt like I was using the G2 but with considerably greater HFOV (VFOV feels about the same, maybe slightly larger) but with really good blacks, better colors and contrast. Yes BETTER COLORS, particularly reds. I don't think it's just a warmer image, colors absolutely pop in the VP2 compared to the G2, and this is really saying something because the G2 has very good colors compared to the Index. Contrast and blacks, my god I had no idea how important blacks were, I mean this isn't OLED level blacks here but it's REALLY close \/ bridges the gap between LCD and OLED. I didn't even think this was possible with LCD. Also, zero ghosting, zero SDE. It's basically G2 level clarity but the radial blur \/ glare hampers this a bit. \n\nThe GLARE, yes the complaints of glare are absolutely real. If you don't like this with the Index get ready for comparable glare in the VP2. To give you an idea, if you stand in SteamVR home and look at the board all of the white text exhibits a kind of distortion that radiates from center to the periphery of the lenses. It takes come getting used to, it's not a deal breaker though, as the pros of the VP2, which I've attempted to describe here, vastly outweigh this one con. \n\n120 Hz. My god, I had no idea how much smoother things feel in VR at 120 Hz vs 90 but once you experience this it's painful to have to restart both Vive Console and SteamVR to reduce the refresh rate to 90 Hz if you intend to play a demanding title such as Asgards Wrath or Assetto Corsa Competizione above 60 Hz due to reprojection. \n\nI've attempted to describe the combination of both tracking and refresh rate improvement going from 90 Hz in the G2 to 120 Hz in the VP2 but it's ineffable, the tracking is perfect, the fluidity, it's absolutely an upgrade over the G2 in this regard. Tracking feels as good as the Index so if you have an Index you already know what to expect. \n\n**FOV**\n\nMeasured FOV for all three headsets: \n\nIndex 106 \/ 104\n\nG2 98 \/ 92\n\nVP2 117 \/ 96\n\nIf you have a G2 the VP2 feels like youre adding 20 degrees of HFOV to it. I have to point out that this is with a 10mm face-pad on the VP2 and 18mm replacement pad on the G2. \n\nI feel the exchange for HFOV for VFOV vs the Index is worth it but I'm someone who is on the ultra-wide monitor bandwagon who upgraded their 2D panel to a 21:9 IPS (AW3418DW) only to upgrade yet again to a Samsung Odyssey G9 under 2 years later. The G2 feels like looking at a 4:3 panel whereas VP2 feels in between 16:9 and 21:9. \n\nI would gladly trade 10 degrees of VFOV for HFOV and here's why. Playing Assetto Corsa Competizione last night, at one point I was in the middle of a long left hander @ Brands Hatch alongside a rival and I could maintain my position without hitting them without the need to choose between following the road or shifting my perspective out of my window to gauge my position with them. With the G2 \/ Index you have more tunnel vision and this kind of perspective is not possible. In this instance, who cares what your seat belt or headliner looks like (the 10 degrees lost in VFOV vs Index). The reason the FOV in the VP2 may not feel as good as the Index is because our natural eyesight has more VFOV than HFOV. When it comes to simulating reality however, horizontal FOV takes up precedence over vertical, hence the reason ultrawide 2D panels feel better than 16:9 or the reason the industry went from 4:3 to 16:9 in the first place. \n\n [What is a human FOV? (askinglot.com)](https:\/\/askinglot.com\/what-is-a-human-fov) \n\n**Performance**\n\nPixels are pixels, seeing roughly the same load as both the G2 and Index depending on what the resolution is. @ 120 Hz I set it to \\~2800x2800 for some super-sampling but to also be able to nail 120 Hz in semi-demanding titles. In The Lab this works out to roughly 55% GPU load, and \\~65% GPU load in SteamVR home and \\~85% load in VR Paradise (90 Hz) and TWD: Saints and Sinners (@ 120 Hz, maxed out settings) with an RTX 3090 under full water block (1980 MHz core + 500 MHz memory @ .938v @ 114% PT \/ 390w). What really surprised me however, was that just as of like a week ago while at starting grid at Brands Hatch in Assetto Corsa Competizione I would see my FPS dip down to like 60-70 FPS while driving past the stands at the start of the race with \\~70% GPU load (i7 8700k @ 5.1 GHz actual @ 1.38v, 0 AVX, delid, 1200kw rad surface area) in the Reverb G2. I was pleasantly surprised to see my FPS stay above 80 FPS here @ 80-90% load in the VP2! Apparently WMR is not only bug riddled garbage ware but it is very demanding of CPU resources as well. \n\n**Bugs \/ Issues**\n\nTo my surprise, based on some advice here (I was scouring this forum on an hourly basis over the weekend) I didn't install Viveport but simply connected the VP2 to the PC and started SteamVR at which point SteamVR prompts one to install Vive Console. This was straightforward. Calibrating the Index controllers was quick and simple in SteamVR. Zero issues here. I do however have a few issues. \n\n1. Camera passthrough is bugged, I've read here today that the solution is to opt into SteamVR beta and I will try that. \n2. There is a faint buzz in the headphones, as others have described, but it is extremely faint and one can only hear it if there is no audio present. \n\nNo other issues to report at this time. In fact, I'm head over heels for this headset coming from G2 + WMR. With G2 + WMR, on top of the aforementioned bugs and issues, simply to get a session going meant one had to restart their PC. If one does not clean restart their PC one will have problems and even after having installed a PCI-E USB hub (and I have a Z370 chipset, not X570!) WMR + G2 would lock up my PC a good 33% of the time. And after a VR session I would have some kind of odd latency where pressing a key on the keyboard would take literally 2 seconds for input to register with the only solution being to restart the PC once again! No such problems with the VP2! It's basically a flawless experience. There is no \"WMR forgot boundary\" crap, or drift issues if using Index controllers, nor camera induced jitter, and the tracking, especially combined with 120 Hz, it's otherworldly coming from G2. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI can't believe the bad reviews the VP2 is getting. To my eyes and head it's an amazing piece of kit. I love everything about this, ESPECIALLY the on ear headphones (for basestation isolation) and the sound quality isn't simply a downgrade compared to G2 \/ Index, yes it has less mids and bass BUT the treble is better, it's much crisper, combined with the sound isolation really facilitates immersion. I also don't find the headphones uncomfortable nor heat trapping. The volume button, every headset going forward should have one. Build quality and aesthetics, the build quality vastly exceeds the G2 and I would say approaches parity with the Index, it definitely loses a point for having a less satisfactory \/ intuitive IPD adjustment mechanism and that's about it. Also, I feel the need to reiterate, it's balanced front to rear and so therefore is more comfortable. The foam padding isn't as comfortable as the antimicrobial cloth of the G2 and Index, HOWEVER, you will be jettisoning the foam padding for a pleather pad to increase the FOV anyway. \n\nI absolutely love my VP2, there is no way it's going back. If I could sum it up I would say that it has near G2 level clarity and comfort with better audio (subjective) and vastly improved blacks, colors and contrast, zero SDE, nearly 20 degrees increase in HFOV and no WMR bullshit nor camera tracking bullshit. If you already own Index lighthouses and controllers you will love the G2. You will need a powerful PC! \n\nIf you have an Index, it's also an upgrade, again you have G2 level clarity, comparable glare, identical tracking, better comfort (again, it's balanced, Index isn't balanced until you add 200g to the rear), better blacks, contrast and colors and to me, I would gladly trade 10 VFOV for HFOV. \n\nI felt spurned to defend the merits of the VP2 due to the complete lack of positive posts here. This has been my experience, this is my opinion, to me the VP2 is amazing and I could not recommend it more highly ESPECIALLY if you have a powerful PC, a Reverb G2 + Index lighthouses and controllers and $800 to burn. \n\nThanks for reading my review.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169851,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A positive Vive Pro 2 review from former G2 and Index owner!","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nvihip\/a_positive_vive_pro_2_review_from_former_g2_and\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[{"award_sub_type":"GLOBAL","award_type":"global","awardings_required_to_grant_benefits":null,"coin_price":150,"coin_reward":0,"count":1,"days_of_drip_extension":0,"days_of_premium":0,"description":"Thank you stranger.

received mine about 2 hours ago. I have owned the **Vive, Vive Pro, Pimax 5k+** and currently have on hand the **G2, Index, Odyssey+ and Quest 2**  Running this on a 5950x and RTX 3090 GPU so I plan on doing some comparisons and some youtube videos for people. **So ask questions in this thread if you want me to film something for you.**\n\n**My thoughts and notes:**\n\n1. I purposely tried to use steamvr without installing the HTC software to see what would happen. SteamVR simply downloads the Vive package for you and installs it... so no dice there; however the vive console is extremely unobtrusive... its about as unobtrusive as FPSVR or OVR advanced settings. It's really not a big deal!\n2. I have a kit that lets you power the headset from a sata port out the back of a pci bracket on the back side of your PC that I used with Vive and Vive Pro. Happy to report it also works great on the Vive Pro 2!\n3. With stock facial padding... the FOV felt like the G2 modded with the 3d Printed facial interface, but with just slightly less vertical FOV. I wasn't impressed with FOV at that point; but colors and pixel resolution were very very good.\n4. I had ordered a Kiwi 8mm foam set in anticipation of the Pro 2. I also used slimmer foam on my Vive Pro when I had it. I pretty much immediately installed it... FOV immediately was more than acceptable vertically and horizontally the best I've seen other than the Pimax. I feel like it maybe is not enough foam... I also have a VRCOVER 10mm foam on the way; and I think that will be the sweet spot for comfort and increased field of view.\n5. With the slim foam; the Nose light blocking flaps worked there way up onto and into the fold of my lower eyelids; making things feel quite weird and somewhat uncomfortable... I need to find a way to remove or cut down those flaps because that would improve my personal comfort dramatically. (If I remember right; with the Vive Pro I was able to tuck them up under the lens which made it a non-issue, but I don't think I can do that with this lens setup.)\n6. Colors are amazing, I tried several games and saw details and colors in lobby areas simply popping. I seriously think if OLED religious zealots gave the panel a shot they would be surprised by how much colors have improved on these LCD panels.\n7. The headset has markedly better black levels than Index or G2! However the overall brightness does seem slightly less than the Index or G2. (With the bright colors and dark blacks; In the back of my brain I was kinda like ... OK OK! I'm back on a Vive again!) Again; I think oled purists should really give this panel a shot. (Yes OLED is best for contrast; but I think you'd be surprised by how good these panels are... I tried a pimax 5k+ and its black levels were absolute garbage and I sold it because of how bad it was compared to my Vive Pro; I was also similarly not super impressed by the Index's black levels; but I could deal with it... this VP2 panel is seriously good in terms of black levels vs. everything else LCD.\n8. I find the glare and internal lens reflections to be MUCH WORSE than the index despite what others have reported....\n9. Screen door effect is virtually non-existent even when trying to look for it... I can't see a pixel on this thing unless I'm super trying hard to see it on the edge of an object, and even that is only because I have very sharp eyes (bordering on 20\/15 vision).\n10. Audio is good, close to the the Index or G2, but **only** if the headphones are pressed hard against your ears; which I personally find quite uncomfortable and I leave them lightly touching my ears; and when they are floating lightly against the ears like that; the audio quality is lacking in bass and audio fidelity. I'm seriously considering in my head if it is possible or worth trying to hack the speakers out of a G2 onto this thing...\n11. The headset seems to wobble slightly; its probably the thicker rear cushioning; but it doesn't feel as solidly attached to my head as the index does; although I need some more time to dial my straps and tightness.\n12. I can't look out of the corner of my eye to look down at my keyboard or phone while using the slim padding; I think removing the nose flaps might help with this as well.\n13. Ghosting? I do my standard test where I load \"The Lab\" and shake my head around while looking at the Black stick figure people against the white background. Happy to report there is NO NOTICEABLE GHOSTING at all! the G2 has quite a bit of ghosting for me in this test; Index has almost no ghosting, but this panel in the VP2 is really something else... :thumbsup:\n14. Microphone: (Haven't modded it yet) Within 5 minutes of using this headset in a lobby; some people who know me commented that my microphone sounded like shit. Granted I told them that I was testing a new headset so maybe that's why they noticed; but... yeah.\n\n**Day 2 Observations:**\n\n1. Putting in a lot more time; I'm Noticing that especially in brightly lit scenes;  and even darker scenes that don't have contrast; the clarity seems quite good; the high resolution shines... but then you hit high contrast scenes and the lens glare and artifacts really hit you. It is especially evident when using desktop inside VR\n2. The Sweet Spot is very tight... and the headset jostles around on my head way more than I'm used to with my index... It is a familiar feeling from my Vive Pro (obvious); The only way to negate this is by clamping down the headset against your skull and face harder than you'd like for comfort; that gets you dialed into the sweet spot; but you have red marks on your face afterwards... I'm appreciating the comfort of the Valve Index more and more as I use the VP2.\n3. I pushed back a few days ago against someone saying we need the GearVR mod for the VP2..... but even if you lost a few HFOV degrees.... I think it would be worth it :(\n4. I installed the software via the vive website to try and get the new beta version of the vive console; This DID trigger a whole setup process that was annoying wanting to reinstall my steamvr; and added a tray icon... after all that; the beta version was the same as the version that steamvr downloaded automatically... **My recommendation: IF you won't be using Viveport; just let steamvr install your software.. it will be more lightweight and no background tray software will run unless steamvr is active.**\n5. **The LATEST NVIDIA Driver caused crashing and stability issues for me on the VP2! I downgraded to 466.27 and everything seems fine again.**\n\n**Happy about:**\n\n* Clarity, Color intensity, Black levels, FOV with thinner facial foam, Almost no perceivable Screen Door effect (unless you have extremely sharp eyes)\n\n**Sad About:**\n\n* No Off Ear Audio, Lens glare\n\nUnsure about:\n\n* Comfort. Whether I can dial in the comfort on the facial interface foam; (I also don't like the feel of the stock facial foam; or the leather feel of the vrcover and kiwi foams) I really would like a cotton pad like Index... I may have to make my own :\/ Also... I feel like cutting those nose flaps down... but don't want to not be able to return the device if I choose to do so..... Hoping they are removeable (seems the Original vive was removeable, but Pro was glued in.... not sure on this one)\n\n**Compared to G2:**\n\n* The G2 has this center ring of clarity which fades abruptly into non-clarity for me; which I found very distracting and off-putting I was worried I would see the same thing with the Vive Pro 2... This is not the case; the clarity seems more uniform on the Vive Pro 2. I've spent a lot of time staring at the opening scene in HL: Alyx on both G2 and VP2 now and the VP2 is seriously clear almost edge to edge and it is a beautiful thing to behold here. I found myself noticing reds on the citadel that I never saw on any other headset.\n* Lens glare is not an issue on the G2, The VP2 is frankly abysmal and distracting in any dark scenes. Bright areas are not a problem.\n* Blacks are noticeably darker using VP2\n* FOV on G2 with 3D printed gasket is pretty decent; The VP2 looks about like that with the stock facial foam; however VP2 has noticeably better FOV than G2 with the slim foam.\n* I don't have to rely on WMR layer! or inconvenient hacks to make valve index controllers work with it. Also tracking is absolutely solid on VP2 vs G2.\n\n**Compared to Valve Index:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I'm already missing the comfort of the Valve Index (my normal daily driver), but I think the VP2 can be modded to close to the same level of comfort\n* FOV... The Vertical FOV on the Index is simply perfect for me with my face shape; I don't see how it could be better, slim foam makes VP2 totally acceptable; however I'm not sure yet if the increased HFOV is worth it on the VP2; If the panels had the same pixel per degree resolution; I would absolutely choose Valve Index, due to comfort and audio; but the VP2 is so clear in terms of pixel resolution per degree that I don't know if I could go back to Index now even though everything else about the Index is better(audio, comfort, VFOV) **UPDATE:** After more time playing with the Pro 2, especially in Half Life: Alyx... I'm seriously missing the vertical field of view of the Index.... There is a lot of looking down at your hands in that game; and I'm finding myself having to crane my neck a lot to see my ammo status or see what is at my feet; where before I could just glance down with my eyes; don't get me wrong; the horizontal FOV is noticeable better on the VP2 than Index; but **To sum it up; the loss of the vertical field of view as compared to the Index; so far is a bit more annoying than the benefit of having a few more degrees of horizontal visibility; since the vertical FOV tends to have your hands directly in the bottom of that area.**\n* Here is a graphical representation of  the FOV difference between index and Vive Pro 2: [https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/L6ys1Ga](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/L6ys1Ga)\n* Lens Glare, There is a bit of lens glare on the Index; but nothing like what I'm seeing on the VP2; its funny because the VP2 lenses look like they would be a bit clearer when you aren't wearing the headset, it looks like \"clear ice\" with rings in it vs the index's \"milky\" with rings in it; but once your head is actually in the headset the VP2s most distracting quality is that lens glare... I don't notice it on my index at all at this point; so I was almost startled by the amount of lens glare in the VP2; (It's the same reason I did the GearVR lens mod on my Vive Pro.) That said;  I think it is something I could get used to; but it definitely is distracting me currently...\n* Something is weird with the VP2 regarding geometry... maybe its because they don't expect you to have your face mashed into it with a slim face pad; but the Valve Index Geometry and sense of.... \"Presence\" is undeniably better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Keeping it?**\n\n~~Even at this early stage I think I'll definitely be keeping the VP2, but will still be looking forward to \"Index 2\" if it is even a thing.~~\n\nI'm now really on the fence about keeping the VP2 over the Index... yes the VP2 wins in great colors, blacks and high res panel; but the lens effects are off-putting, comfort has to be sacrificed to get the HFOV gains over the Index; but you still lose vertical FOV; which I'm realizing is PRIME real estate for hands and menus; the VP2 audio isn't bad; but only if you squish the earphones hard into your ears and line them up and expect them to never shift. It's like I'm taking 2 steps forward but 5 steps backward.... \\*Sigh\\*.... can we just get valve to drop these panels in a revised index?\n\n**Other Weird Thoughts:**\n\n* Both the Vive Pro 2 and Reverb G2 and Index all have removeable earphones.... any thoughts on whether we could maybe 3d print an adapter and get a conversion harness for the wires and get off ear audio onto the Vive Pro 2?

Please note that this may have been updated since, so if anyone can explain in detail more about reshader, please let others know anything else I've not mentioned in this thread.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a GTX 1660 ti, mid-range graphics cards, and its made a big difference.  If you have a higher end card, you might be able to drop the quality after this for higher fps, but you can look into that later:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you want an example try checking out this screenshot from [Fallout 4](https:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/fallout4\/mods\/48934).  Try and look between screenshot 1 &amp; screenshot 2 for non-CAS and CAS differences (don't look at the left\/right eye sockets)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Please note that since this is editing a game's files, it could count as a fake hack when playing online games (Like battleye) so I recommend not doing this for certain games that use programs like this to search for cheaters, keep it single player or casual multiplayer games**\n\n**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst you download this mod for VR Skyrim, don't worry it works for all VR available games that benefit from this (you will need to register, it's all good, I've done it before for Subnautica VR mod):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/skyrimspecialedition\/mods\/46999\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen extract all the files in the zip in your root directory of your game file (where the exe is), so in your Steam folder find \"...Steam\/steamapps\/common\/GAMENAME\" and drop the files in there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt should be 4 files called \"reshade-shaders\" folder, \"Reshade\" &amp; \"Reshade Preset \"config setting, and \"dxgi.dll\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLoad up the game and it should be good to go!  If you're uncertain if its working, check the top left of your screen on your monitor and it should say the shader mod has been installed, or press the \"HOME\" button on your keyboard and check your monitor and it should bring up the reshader options screen.  Some VR headsets have \"monitor\" mode built into them, so you can check it this way instead of leaning over and removing your VR headset.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you ever want these features removed, just delete the four files (sometimes dxgi.dll creates a notepad file, you can delete that as well) and your game is back to normal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can toggle the \"END\" key on your keyboard to turn off\/on the effects within the game if you need to see the differences yourself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's my current game list that this works for, please feel free to add workable games to this.  If the game has (Win64) next to it, you may need to drop the 4 files into it's Win64 folder app instead to make it work.  Games marked with (+) are my personal favourite changes.  Please note that CAS is not perfect, as some changes might be too bright or saturated and may not be required, but in most cases it improves your experience to the better.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**1943 Berlin Blitz**\n\n**Against Demo**\n\n**Aircar** (I think this is the only game that did not benefit from the changes, try it for yourself)\n\n**Beat Saber** (might require a high framerate to make the effects less distracting)\n\n**Bigscreen Beta (+)**\n\n**Blade Runner 9732**\n\n**Blueplanet VR demo**\n\n**Boneworks**\n\n**Borderlands 2 VR (Win64)**\n\n**Budget Cuts (+)**\n\n**Cards &amp; Tankards (+)**\n\n**Conscious Existence - A Journey Within** (I don't think helped this experience, not recommended)\n\n**Creed: Rose to Glory (Win64)**\n\n**Davigo (demo)**\n\n**Final Assault (+)**\n\n**FORM (demo)**\n\n**Google Earth (+)** (Please note for this game you must rename \"dxgi.dll\" to \"opengl32.dll\" for it to work)\n\n**GORN**\n\n**GRIP: Combat Racing (+)**\n\n**Holopoint**\n\n**Home - A VR Spacewalk (Win64)**\n\n**Hover Junkers**\n\n**Horizon Vanguard (Win64)**\n\n**In Death (Win64)**\n\n**Iron Rebellion (demo)**\n\n**Job Simulator (+)**\n\n**The Lab (+)**\n\n**Moss**\n\n**Nightstar Alliance (+)**\n\n**No Clue VR**\n\n**Pavlov VR (Win64)**\n\n**Pokerstars VR (+?)** (please note that the start-up logo has messed up colours, but ingame it looks fantastic!)\n\n**Project Wingman (Win64)**\n\n**Raw Data (Win64)**\n\n**Redout: Enhanced Edition**\n\n**Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality**\n\n**Serious Sam VR: The First Encounter**\n\n**A Shopping Trip To Eklan Tor**\n\n**Smashbox Arena (+)**\n\n**SportsBar VR (Win64)**\n\n**Sprint Vector (Win64)**\n\n**Star Trek: Bridge Crew**\n\n**Subnautica**\n\n**Superhot VR**\n\n**Surge (Win64)**\n\n**Swords of Gurrah**\n\n**Tiltbrush (+)**\n\n**Until You Fall**\n\n**The Walking Dead: Saint &amp; Sinners (+) (Win64)**\n\n**VRChat (+?)** (please note with so many worlds, some changes might not be for the better)\n\n**Zero Caliber VR (Win64)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's a list of games that don't work, or have not been able to get working yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Accounting**\n\n**Alien Isolation**\n\n**Battle Dome**\n\n**Compound**\n\n**Cooking Simulator VR (beta)**\n\n**Doom 1\/2 (classic)**\n\n**Doom 3 BFG Fully Possessed**\n\n**Elite Dangerous**\n\n**Eye of the Temple (demo)**\n\n**The Forest**\n\n**Google Spotlight Stories animation (any)**\n\n**Half Life: Alyx**\n\n**I Expect You To Die**\n\n**Onward**\n\n**Quake VR**\n\n**Project Cars 1**\n\n**Sairento VR**\n\n**Scanner Sombre**\n\n**Space Pirate Trainer**\n\n**Star Wars Squadrons**\n\n**The Blu**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169846,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Have you tried CAS (Contrast Adaptive Sharpener) mod? - It makes your graphics sharper with no performance issues","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.75,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/nb4nm9\/have_you_tried_cas_contrast_adaptive_sharpener\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"vive420","author_created_utc":1482559486,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":"hasCommented","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":"","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_13tgy1","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1616063030,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"m7nuhv","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_m7nuhv","no_follow":false,"num_comments":6,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/m7nuhv\/are_there_any_decent_ovr_systems_that_let_you\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623428870,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I have an OG Vive with OG wands.

Consider donating. Details are on my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr). At the time of writing, we're already 27% there!*~~  \nWe are 100% there, wow! It takes at least 30 days to be allowed to publish it for good, but I'll make sure to start the process as soon as possible. Thank you for your contributions!\n\nIt's me again, with yet another Desktop+ release.\n\nIt's been more than a full year since the initial release of Desktop+ 1.0 now. What started with me simply questioning how hard it could be to do a better job than Valve at writing a simple desktop overlay (the old SteamVR desktop was quite stuttery at the time) has evolved into quite the tool.  \nAnd with this release it's also able to capture windows directly (meaning they can be covered by other windows or partially off-screen without issue). Maybe I should've called it Desktop+Windows+OtherStuff instead.\n\nAnyways, the main addition in this version is window capture support, as you might've guessed. This uses Windows Graphics Capture and requires *at least Windows 10 1803* for basic support, and *Windows 10 2004 or newer* for full support.  \nThe old capture method based on DXGI Desktop Duplication is not going away, however. You can choose which one to use for each overlay, depending on your needs (exclusive full-screen doesn't work with Graphics Capture for example). And if you really are using a system that doesn't support Graphics Capture at all, you can still use every other feature in Desktop+ as before.\n\nBut this might sound confusing if you've never heard of Desktop+ before, so here's a quick introduction:  \nIt's a free and open-source desktop (and now also window!) overlay application providing a bunch of extra features while not bogging down your machine from running your VR games.\n\nIts features are...\n\n- User interface with real-time adjustments accessible in VR or on desktop\n- Smooth, low-latency mirroring of desktops and windows\n- Low memory footprint and performance impact\n- Multi-GPU support\n- Support for creating as many overlays as SteamVR allows at once\n- Customizable overlay settings (width, position, curvature, opacity), with switchable profiles\n- Overlay cropping\n- 3D support (SBS, HSBS, OU, HOU)\n- Overlay visibility and origin settings: Display a desktop\/window during gameplay or attach it to a different origin (play space, dashboard, HMD, controllers, tracker)\n- Actions: User-definable functions (input simulation, running applications) which can be bound to controller or UI buttons\n- Keyboard Extension, enabling use of modifier, arrow and function keys\n- Elevated access toggle, making it possible to deal with UAC prompts and other UIP-restricted UI in VR without using full admin-access at all times\n- Gaze Fade: Fade-out overlay when not looking at it\n- Window Management: Change window focus depending on overlay\/dashboard state or drag overlays when dragging the title bar of a mirrored window\n- Free and open-source\n\nDesktop+ 2.3 mainly focuses on the new window capture support, but there have also been some other small additions and changes.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n- Added alternative capture method: Graphics Capture, enabling direct mirroring of windows\n- Added warning when an elevated process's window has focus\n- Fixed cropping behavior on Over-Under 3D overlays\n- Fixed overlays staying invisible after deactivating Gaze Fade while current opacity was 0%\n- Fixed UI curving behavior with small dashboard overlay widths\n- Fixed custom action icons not loading if there was an Action without icon in-between\n- Moved \"Focus Scene-App on Dashboard Deactivation\" setting to the new Windows setting page\n- Double-click assistant is now canceled on deliberate laser pointer movements\n- Removed \"Auto\" curvature setting since the SteamVR dashboard's curvature can no longer be accessed\n- Various other minor fixes and adjustments\n\nAlso new, but technically not part of the release: There's now a [User Guide](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/blob\/master\/docs\/user_guide.md) which goes into deeper detail of each of the settings, breaks down the differences between the two capture methods and offers step-by-step examples for a few common usage scenarios.  \nIt's by no means a mandatory read, but if you're curious, check it out.\n\nAs always, this version can be found on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nJust as hinted in the very first line of this post, I've started accepting donations for Desktop+'s development since the 2.2 release. And I've honestly not expected anyone to actually throw money my way, given the main appeal of Desktop+ (it being free), so it already has exceeded my expectations. Thank you for contributions!  \nAs of right now, every cent donated will go towards paying the Steam Direct submission fee to bring Desktop+ to Steam (as a free app). I'm playing the slow game here, but I feel like this is a viable way to go about things after all.  \nIf you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).  \n\nAs nice as Graphics Capture is, there were quite a few code changes and adjustments needed to support it. I have no doubt there was something I missed in testing, so if anything breaks, please let me know.  \nI think that's about it. If anything's unclear, I'm happy to help.\n\nEdit:  \nDonation goal for Steam release has been reached!

You will be required to play the game in either mouse+keyboard or VR set-up (your own), based on your preferences and experience. After, there will be questionnaires about your experience. The study will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to complete and it will take place entirely online, with the requirement that you join a specifically created Discord server for the purpose of the study, which you can leave once the study is over.\n\nThis study investigates teamwork in a co-operative video game with different hardware set-ups. Its primary purpose is to identify potential advantages and\/or constraints of these set-ups for facilitating teamwork in experienced teams. Additionally, it will contribute to my PhD thesis, thus helping me in obtaining my doctorate. Unfortunately, there is no monetary incentive for it.\n\n**Inclusion Criteria:**\n\n* Anyone over the age of 18.\n* Anyone with appropriate experience in and highly familiar with PayDay 2 in either its desktop form or VR form.\n\n**Exclusion Criteria:**\n\n* Anyone aged 0 - 17.\n* Anyone with visual field epilepsy.\n* Anyone with visual impairments which would make it hard or impossible to see and cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.\n* Anyone with neck injuries.\n* Anyone with hearing impairments that are not corrected with hearing aids.\n* Anyone with speech impediments which may make it difficult to communicate clearly.\n* Anyone not fluent in English.\n\nIf you are interested in taking part, please contact the researcher Beata-Noemi Balint via email ([beata-noemi.balint@port.ac.uk](mailto:beata-noemi.balint@port.ac.uk) please use \u201cTeamwork Study\u201d as the subject line of the email) or Discord (beanb#8832, this is preferred) with any further questions you may have.

You might have seen my stuff. I maintain an [\u201cacab\u201d Great Games\/Software list ](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/103hdtyJ0F_gLyxQ28sb6KK3ZK-IXRX0vQ0JFettJmyM\/)that I recommend checking out, as well as a [guide to getting into VR](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/HalfLife\/comments\/f2hsql\/requirements_for_half_life_alyx_and_how_to_get\/). And [an explainer about how the Index is an AR headset and how you can test it out](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/j3s489\/the_valve_index_is_an_ar_headset); either the community or Valve, ideally both, can really make that turn into a real use case.\n\n I made this guide to help people feel  more comfortable and reduce friction in VR. It\u2019s also supposed to make  you fully acquainted with SteamVR settings, how to use things like  Desktop view so you don't have to take off your headset, how to get into  VR quickly, and some addons you should use. Always look for ways to do  the things you want to do in VR or can't do right now.\n\nThere\u2019s  a tool called Aardvark that some community people and a valve person or  two are trying to get going, that could make being inside VR a lot less  clunky by creating a really great way to make apps and gadgets that run  over VR\/AR and can communicate between users and each other.. Answer  your phone, take out a virtual HOTAS, hang out with a friend without  being in the same game, play couch co op in AR, a lot of things are  possible. If you know how to code in React or you like making VR  overlays and hacks you should look into it.\n\n# Set up\n\n You have to redo your room set up if  you take down your base stations or move them around. Sometimes tracking  will still work the same if you move your base stations, but the  guardians will be messed up. There is no way to do the room set up  in-headset in passthrough yet, but when you have to make your boundaries  click \"advanced mode\" and you just have to mark the four corners of  your play space.\n\nMake sure you  have powercycling on so the base stations turn on and off with the  headset. You can set up base stations either at waist level just sitting  on tables (2.0 only), on tall camera stands, or on the wall. If they  are ever moved they do need to do room set up again. If you set them up  on the wall you probably can just unplug the cord on both ends and take  it out again when you need it.\n\nYour  PC's startup is quick and easy if boot off an SSD and turn off password  login in windows. You can add a headless monitor if you want to move  your computer around without a monitor or TV so that you still have  desktop view.\n\nThe way I use VR is  that I walk into the room, I press the power button on my PC (monitor  left off), I walk over to my Index and click the button on the bottom  (this turns on steamVR as long as Steam is running), put it on, and I\u2019m  in VR. I turn on 3D passthrough (double-click the button on the headset)  to pick up my controllers, then turn passthrough off after I pick a  game.\n\n# SteamVR\n\n SteamVR starts when you press the  system button on your headset, as long as steam is open. For opening  games, I either use the dashboard, which isn't idea because it only  shows your recently played games, or I use icons on my PC desktop.\n\nSteam  Big Picture mode is always accessible in VR. Click your library button  on the dashboard and then \u201cbrowse all\u201d to see your whole Steam library,  and click back to the Big Picture home to use things like Steam Chat and  invite people\/join their games.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vqwpn93hfqr51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6870889bbc8e9c6d8fa44f6c9d60fb4a190fc206](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vqwpn93hfqr51.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6870889bbc8e9c6d8fa44f6c9d60fb4a190fc206)\n\nA few notes. The Room set up does what you expect. The tutorial is a  little portal themed easter egg Valve made for the Vive. Resetting  seated position is for when you want to sit somewhere other than the  room center and the game doesn't have a setting for that. Display VR  view brings up the VR mirror of steamVR which includes things like  overlays and if you select the two eye version it works better than any  generic in game one but there is a slight performance cost. Devices is  where you can pair controllers. Workshop is mostly for SteamVR home  environments. Settings is what we're focused on here. \n\n# SteamVR Settings\n\n*Do this on the desktop to make it easier for you. On the little steamVR box click the three lines and then \u201csettings\u201d to open the settings UI. Do it right now while you read the guide if you want, your headset should be idle and not rendering if you're not wearing it.*\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qyi6ozkzb9r51.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0116f15bb69781f8f4f7ff440115c32244d064f](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/qyi6ozkzb9r51.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0116f15bb69781f8f4f7ff440115c32244d064f)\n\nTurn on advanced settings in the left corner. Then take a look at what\u2019s in the general settings. Refresh rate, brightness, render resolution, etc are obvious. Click from \u201cauto\u201d to \u201ccustom\u201d on the resolution if you don\u2019t want it to change the resolution when you change frame rate. Notifications means you can turn steam notifications on and off.\n\nAt the bottom there is an option for SteamVR Home. If you don\u2019t use it I would definitely turn it off since I don\u2019t like running a graphically intensive outdated program when I\u2019m not doing anything.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/buw7x590c9r51.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d7025ac84faf9e5f49c3c11df2ee9467d36730](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/buw7x590c9r51.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11d7025ac84faf9e5f49c3c11df2ee9467d36730)\n\nNext click on play area. I use a medium grid chaperone, and I set the color to white and have a low activation distance. I remove the play area floor by making it invisible since it isn\u2019t necessary and doesn't cover the whole floor anyway. Choose the white background if you hate glare.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0mg5omn0c9r51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=518ea3513f991c39b33cbbef79666600c30f429b](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0mg5omn0c9r51.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=518ea3513f991c39b33cbbef79666600c30f429b)\n\nNext click on dashboard in the menu list. I would set \u201cshow desktop tab\u201d to \u201coff\u201d if you\u2019re going to use an app like desktop+ to replace your desktop view. You can turn all of the tabs off or make the system button do nothing if you\u2019re putting someone else in VR and they accidentally press it a lot. You\u2019ll still be able to go into your SteamVR settings on the desktop and change it back. Dashboard position does what it says, so bring it closer if you can't see clearly or further away if you don't have enough room.\n\nI address the controller bindings topic at the end.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w4dveut1c9r51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09aef149e041d93b9803ccd0bc4cddbdbcc58bcb](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/w4dveut1c9r51.png?width=795&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09aef149e041d93b9803ccd0bc4cddbdbcc58bcb)\n\nIn the video menu there are a lot of the same options as the general tab. Make sure \u201cfade to grid on app hang\u201d us on, and at the button where it says pause VR while headset is idle you may want to make sure that is on. Overlay render quality shouldn't really matter. Changing resolution doesn't work without a restart in every game based on its engine, but changing refresh rate works in every game except Alyx.\n\nRender resolution basically works by either being set to \"auto,\" where SteamVR picks a resolution based on your refresh rate and GPU, and \"custom\" where you choose the value. If you want to keep your resolution when you change your refresh rate, keep it on custom. I play Pistol Whip at 144hz with full super sampling. Having something like fpsVR makes it really easy to tell what settings work for you.\n\nThe bar that says \u201cper application video settings'' is very useful. What this does is allow you to add a resolution modifier for a specific game that is always applied to that game (whatever your default resolution is times the modifier), and you can change the \u201cmotion smoothing\u201d setting. Here\u2019s an example of that in action: In Pavlov matches with 40-50 people, both the CPU and GPU frametimes tank and fluctuate a lot. So what I do is that I set my index to 120hz, and then I turn motion smoothing to \u201cforce always on.\u201d That means the game only tries to render 60 frames and fills in the rest. There\u2019s artifacting but it\u2019s smooth. In games that are CPU bound this is also important since you can't just lower the resolution and fix it. You can also do this in the main panel of fpsVR.\n\nTurning off motion smoothing just changes how reprojection works. Motion smoothing is when it switches to running at half framerate and fills in the other half, where the old reprojection method was only replacing the frames you were missing, which could look choppier.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c0bd13f2c9r51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe282ed4109d02325c5f34277c8cf8638ab483fe](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/c0bd13f2c9r51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe282ed4109d02325c5f34277c8cf8638ab483fe)\n\nIn the audio menu you can change you input and output devices. This could be useful if you want to use RTX voice (uses GPU power to eliminate any background noise), since it appears as a separate microphone. You can mirror audio if you\u2019re showing a game off to people, and you can turn out output from both the speakers and something plugged into the 3.5mm audio hack.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3wxn43l3c9r51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0d30292658c64176a7a46cebc4632044df4c0f](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/3wxn43l3c9r51.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0d30292658c64176a7a46cebc4632044df4c0f)\n\nFor cameras, turn on 3D room view. Then room view has a few options, I use opaque passthrough to just see the world but you can make it less obvious. The reason you would do that is that \u201cshow camera at room edge\u201d makes the passthrough come on when you step close to the boundaries.This is good for showing it off to new people but is a little slow, so you might want to go back to dashboard and adjust how close you need to be to trigger the walls.\n\nIf you have Natural Locomotion installed, it breaks your camera, just so you know.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p8j5mc34c9r51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72210d48a60ff32262f360fbf6e90dc40e64a8e2](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/p8j5mc34c9r51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72210d48a60ff32262f360fbf6e90dc40e64a8e2)\n\nStartup is important. You can change which apps steamVR starts up with. You don\u2019t have to have revive enabled to actually use revive, it just turns off the library button. You can also stop other apps like Desktop+, metachromium, and fpsVR from starting with steamVR everytime if you want.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cog1wre4c9r51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2d7d0d616107a004524c509e59f56d0fc3b6942](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cog1wre4c9r51.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2d7d0d616107a004524c509e59f56d0fc3b6942)\n\nThe only \u201cdeveloper\u201d tab setting you might want is to enable \u201cshow GPU performance\u201d because it shows a graph on your face of your GPU frametimes, making it easy to see how your setting decisions affect performance. But fpsVR works better for this.\n\n# SteamVR Add-Ons\n\n# [Desktop+](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus)\n\n[https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/master\/docs\/screenshot.jpg](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/master\/docs\/screenshot.jpg)\n\nThis is a leaner, better version of the SteamVR desktop mirror. It also adds a keyboard that lets you do things like click \u201ccontrol\u201d or \u201cshift\u201d and then another key so you can copy and paste even when you can\u2019t right click.\n\nOne particularly useful feature is that it adds a task switcher which you can just click to tab out of the game you\u2019re in. Lots of games load fullscreen and basically block you from doing anything else at the same time. This makes it easy to use discord, look something up, go on twitter during downtime, etc. It\u2019s useful to not feel as limited in VR.\n\nYou should also be able to pin a window to stay when you leave the system menu as well and be there in the game. There are a lot of settings you can change but you can ignore those completely and have a simple experience.\n\n# [fpsVR](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/908520\/fpsVR\/)\n\nThen there is fpsVR, sold on steam for $4. This has a lot of settings (and likely inspired some of Valve\u2019s improvements to SteamVR after the index came out). Of note are a few things.\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwmfli8kd9r51.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05562d3e9ff319693312f764def8df08a331fa1c](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/iwmfli8kd9r51.png?width=399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05562d3e9ff319693312f764def8df08a331fa1c)\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7m43ulw7d9r51.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5564aeaf724230c7ae74834476ca0bce18ae6c71](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7m43ulw7d9r51.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5564aeaf724230c7ae74834476ca0bce18ae6c71)\n\nOne, you can change the motion smoothing setting to always on more easily, right there where it says \u201cmotion smoothing,\u201d click and then you should see the options. This applies to all apps until you change it back.\n\n* Two, and this is the biggest one, you can add an overlay next to your hand that shows your GPU and CPU frametimes, temps, a clock, etc. It\u2019s essential to choosing settings in games and always makes it easy to see if you\u2019re dropping frames and why. I always use this and have it attached to my left wrist.\n* Three, it adds \u201cdesktop utilities\u201d to the normal steam desktop view, which is useful if you don\u2019t want to use Desktop+, because you can press the alt tab macro and see the desktop.\n* Four, you can set a center marker. You can also have the center marker track the tangling of your headset so you can untangle it without taking it off. You can also have the marker follow you so it doesn\u2019t show the center but also lets you see which way is forward or how tangled you are by just looking at your feet.\n* Five, you can tweak your play space if needed, tweak the floor, add a beeping warning when people get close to the edges, have the edges get really obvious if you get really close, or hide all chaperones.\n* That last one can be useful if you sometimes sit on a couch on the edge of your playspace and want all chaperones gone. In utilities you can show or hide the steamVR mirror from within the headset. And six, you can restart SteamVR if something is borked without taking off the headset, the headset will turn off and then back on.\n\n[OVR Advanced Settings](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1009850\/OVR_Advanced_Settings\/)\n\nThis enables a lot of niche functions and tweaks. It's free on github and Steam. If you have accessibility\/mobility concerns I recommend looking into it. They have a discord, so head there if you need it for those reason and they'll probably help you out.\n\n# Using your desktop in VR\n\nYou can always access the desktop through your system menu button, the one that brings up the steam dashboard. Trigger is left click and thumbpad is right click. Don't be afraid to use this function. I use it to go online, download something, unzip it, and then launch it in VR without taking off the headset. The replacement keyboard from Desktop+ helps a lot.\n\nWhen you use an overlay like Desktop+ or fpsVR to add the ability to tab out of the VR game\u2019s desktop window, you can do most of the things you need to do. Opening discord, a browser, even watch youtube videos, whatever, probably isn\u2019t going to affect your performance unless the game is really CPU bound.\n\nIf you want a second or third monitor in VR, you need to buy a headless monitor, because of how Windows works. It's just a cheap dummy monitor plug that tells windows it's a 4K 60hz monitor or whatever.  Desktop+ and a few other programs like Virtual Desktop let you use them at the same time.\n\nFor what it's worth, I always turn on the passthrough when I use the desktop view, it feels more comfortable and always runs underneath the dashboard or overlays.\n\n# Controller Bindings\n\nIn the controllers menu, you can  manage controller bindings even when not in an app, although that  doesn\u2019t always work. I recommend starting up a game or piece of software  with the headset off, then making your custom bindings on your monitor.  Again, just click into your steamVR settings on the desktop with mouse  and keyboard.\n\nThis whole system is  glitchy and sometimes just doesn't work, and some games don't support  it at all so you have to literally map one button to another rather than  a specific function. But it also allows you a lot of control. Like you  can make something actuate faster by changing how much the trigger or  grab needs to be held down before it actuates. But I also cannot make a  full guide to how this system works because I actually don't understand  every function it has.\n\nTwo uses I  found for example, were changing mag release in some games to pressing  down on the thumbpad, or in H3 I run whenever my off hand is squeezing  down. It's a useful system. TTS is one game that benefited from  completely redoing the controls myself in this system. If a game doesn't  use the thumbpad, I recommend taking a look at what you can rebind it  to do; the thumbpad can work as one button, two buttons, or four  buttons.\n\n# The Frunk\n\n[https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g9yyc2vveqr51.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81fcbce7c309d94b94d23073c5ce6d30d91b9019](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g9yyc2vveqr51.jpg?width=450&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81fcbce7c309d94b94d23073c5ce6d30d91b9019)\n\nJust realized that this might need a  mention. The Index Frunk has had a few interesting mods for it but  largely has gone unused. But I have a few uses for it.\n\n1. One,  you can use a gamepad or anything else USB by plugging it into the  headset. I would assume this also lowers latency, so for seated VR it  can be nice, or when playing a VR game standing with a gamepad in  VorpX\/GTA 5 in VR.\n2. Sometimes  I play TTS with only one controller, so it works really well if I have  my controller plugged into the headset. You might be able to get an  adapter to charge both.\n3.

I\u2019m the person who maintains the \u201cACAB good games list\u201d and a guide to getting into VR\/upgrading a PC, and I\u2019m working on a guide to using VR that helps people eliminate friction.\\]\n\n# The Valve Index is an AR Headset\n\nIn June, Valve released 3D passthrough for the Index. They actually paid another company to do it and in all likelihood they could have done it way way sooner. Either way, it means that, besides some warping around your hands, you have a view of the room you\u2019re in that actually looks real. And as it turns out, there isn\u2019t an actual reason why you couldn\u2019t run a game or other software over that passthrough. \n\nBasically you can judge for yourself. Go on steam, download a program called \u201cMetachromium\u201d (turn it off in your startup settings so it doesn\u2019t launch on its own with steamVR), turn on your passthrough, and then run Metachromium. It\u2019s a desktop UI so just use your desktop view on your dashboard to input any WebXR URL. Choose one without a background environment and MoonRider\u2019s controls don\u2019t work unfortunately. Any stuttering is the WebXR sites, not the AR. \n\nHere are two sites you can try, just load them in Metachromium with your passthrough running and then click the VR button on the page.\n\n[https:\/\/zach-geek.gitlab.io\/vartiste\/#](https:\/\/zach-geek.gitlab.io\/vartiste\/#)\n\n[https:\/\/whiteboard-xr.herokuapp.com\/vr.html](https:\/\/whiteboard-xr.herokuapp.com\/vr.html?room=ROOM)\n\nHere is facebook\u2019s own depiction of the best the Quest 2 can do.\n\n[https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/6ZF9GLt\/Oculus-Quest-Spatial-Passthrough-API-Spatial-Avatar-768x432.jpg](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/6ZF9GLt\/Oculus-Quest-Spatial-Passthrough-API-Spatial-Avatar-768x432.jpg)\n\nAnd this is what took me five minutes to figure out on my index (It looks better in-headset, especially everything arranging itself on my walls and the lighting) \n\n[https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/W5M7ySj\/Capture-Copy.jpg](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/W5M7ySj\/Capture-Copy.jpg)\n\n[https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/S7rQPy6\/Capture3-Copy.jpg](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/S7rQPy6\/Capture3-Copy.jpg)\n\n[https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/D7p4DNG\/Capt5555ure.png](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/D7p4DNG\/Capt5555ure.png)\n\nThis is the absolute bare minimum of what is possible. This is what is possible with nothing officially supported or made to use with AR, and with super basic WebXR programs. You might not be all that impressed with passthrough AR but it\u2019s a real thing. Apple is rumored to be making a passthrough AR headset, some french startup is making one for $1,500, and Facebook is adding a low resolution, black and white, \u201cpassthrough+\u201d mode for AR next year on the Quest 2 for their own apps and then third party apps including work software \u201cSpatial.\u201d \n\nValve just isn\u2019t going to make this functionality official apparently, technically they could have done it when the Index came out, since they just paid some other company to add 3D passthrough anyway. Over a year later, this is a really big deal and it needs to be made usable before Infinite Office and Quest 2 Passthrough AR comes out. Valve could flip a few switches, make a guide for Devs to take advantage of it, and then the Index is the first consumer AR headset and they can add an \u201cAugmented Reality\u201d tab to Steam. History made, at no additional cost to you. \n\n# And then there is Aardvark. \n\nAardvark is a community project by a Valve programmer and some open XR people like the creator of Pluto ( a program that lets people hang out in VR without being in the same program). The idea behind Aardvark is that you can create AR apps inside of VR, from floating UI to spatial tools, and since it runs on top of VR programs it can have a lot more functionality. The same way that AR glasses will one day let you answer a phone call by waving your hand, it's envisioned as a way of allowing Devs to make AR in the here and now. \n\nThe difference between Aardvark and normal SteamVR overlays is that these can communicate with each other, meaning if someone makes a wrist mounted UI, someone else could make a discord integrated UI add on that slots right into it. And Aardvark overlays can communicate with another person\u2019s, so you could share your screen, play poker, pick up a line of text and hand it to another person so they can paste it, etc.\n\nIt definitely has huge potential and if you\u2019re a coder or a dev, you should definitely look into it. It\u2019s on github and already works over passthrough even if it\u2019s a bit stuttery. There are actually not a lot of things you couldn\u2019t do with it in theory. And since none of these things need to be the dedicated focus of your time or the only overlay you\u2019re running, it basically brings the app structure to VR where you download some QoL, UI, or system tweak for a dollar and can use it whenever you want. One of the bigger draws of the Quest is the idea that it\u2019s a super smooth experience and the closed garden allows less friction than open PCVR can achieve. That is something that tools like Aardvark could completely reverse because they would allow a level of integration, resources, and third party applications that just aren't possible on mobile, and a level of customization, control, and pluggability that Facebook will never allow. We could get new features all the time from the community either as open source projects or paid add ons.\n\nI myself submitted a bunch of ideas for Aardvark, and was told that nearly all of them were possible, but obviously they\u2019re just concepts. Some examples: \n\n* A rear warning system that tells you the exact object you\u2019re about to walk into and where it is relative to you, making irregular boundaries more viable or letting you ignore things like walking into your couch. Could even allow you tracking a moving object if you have a Vive tracker\/spare Vive wand.\n* A full HOTAS that renders over a game, basically adding VR motion controls to any game even if it doesn\u2019t support them (Squadrons\/Sturmovik\/MS Flight Simulator)\n* Macropads that let you do work or stream in VR and have a macro UI that can do anything you want. You could have all the functionality of a half dozen $200 macropads for free. That way working in VR would have actual advantages.\n* An in VR gameboy that lets you play emulators or steam games with your VR controllers or a gamepad in the middle of a social VR app. This could even extend to playing multiplayer (screenshare plus hooking into Remote Play Together). Imagine you each sitting on your couch, seeing your friends next to you in AR, and playing on a display rendered over your TV.\n* An input output organizer that lets you set up your own chains, like RSS feed photos popping up in SteamVR home, letting you record a message and have it tweeted out, control your room fan to match up with the level in your game\n* Card games you can play with other people in AR on a real life table.\n* A body based UI system based on the HEV suit that easily plugs in any and all add ons you have onto your arms or chest or wherever you want and be shifted to avoid covering up any in game UI.\n* Replacing the entire SteamVR game launching system with a VR\/AR bookcase where every game you have is rendered as a case on the shelf with the name on the spine, art on the cover, and Steam description on the back. You can arrange them however you want and save the layout and shelves you make. \n* Universal avatars you can use across any software you want or even outside software with dedicated avatar systems. \n* Passthrough Portals that let you mark out the couch as a 3D passthrough zone, so when you\u2019re playing with friends in the room, you can always turn back and see them, so VR is basically no longer isolating if you don\u2019t want it to be. You could also mark out your keyboard, mouse, even a glass of water so you can easily work in VR. A person holding a Vive tracker could be in the game with you if you want.\n* A controller assistance system that would let you put a friend in VR and use your phone or desktop (even over parsec\/remote play together) to highlight buttons when you\u2019re showing them what to do.\n* A translator that listens to what you say, translates it, and shows it as text in front of you as you talk, showing you a reverse translation of what other people are hearing to make sure it\u2019s not too bad. \n* Metamatchmaking that lets you mark multiplayer games you want to play and then matching you up with anyone else who wants to play them and alerting all of you to start up the game and play.\n* Replacements for the steamVR keyboard with one that actually works and supports other languages, as well as a virtual mouse that locks into a flat plane instead of a laser pointer\n* Hand tracking through the Vive SDK, the Leap Motion, or emulated with Index controllers.\n\nThe idea I was most interested in was the idea of tracing out your room in 3D vector shapes, then making them invisible occlusion zones. Do it once in 30 minutes and then all your apps can use it from now on. That would allow real world objects to occlude virtual ones, a really key part of AR (occlusion in AR is like the transition from 3doF to 6doF in VR) that would allow for completely new experiences. It would also let you mark out the things you traced with context, so a character in a VR game could sit in a chair, walk through a door, etc or your friends could appear in AR sitting in the chair next you and the game you\u2019re playing could appear on your real table. And since it\u2019s preprogrammed and done through SteamVR tracking it could be much smoother than anything done with machine vision currently. \n\nAR is the real prize of everything in XR; if VR is a billion dollar industry that will change gaming then AR is expected to be a trillion dollar industry that will change the world. Facebook only does VR to build a hardware, software, production, and dev base for AR. They want to beat Apple, who have the most advanced AR SDK of anyone and make their own silicon, and are reportedly working on AR glasses. Valve basically invented consumer AR back in 2013 and just didn\u2019t ship it; future Facebook exec Micheal Abrash fired Valve\u2019s whole AR division and so their head AR engineer Jeri Elsworth took her research and made her own startup, TiltFive.\n\nFacebook\u2019s main showcase of their AR right now is Infinite Office. It\u2019s an app where you can have a black and white low res background view of the world, use a special keyboard you have to buy, use the trackpad on the keyboard since mouses aren\u2019t supported, and you can control your browser since it doesn\u2019t let you control your PC. That\u2019s it. Valve could absolutely stomp that by giving you full color higher res passthrough, let you control your PC and actual keyboard and mouse, add virtual macropads, dashboards, and other things to help you work, multimonitor support, and even letting you work alongside someone else in AR and share screens. Third parties are getting all in on facebook passthrough, like remote work software Spatial where again, PC headsets are the only ones comfortable enough for working and allow for a lot more functionality (including occlusion and context awareness) and full color so it\u2019s a huge waste for AR to not be supported on PC. Facebook is clearly hoping this will be a huge draw for the Quest (and I'm sure the VR outlets will reeeally lay on the praise), push it into workplaces, and make it a devkit for AR. Valve can and should kill that in the cradle, even if killing the Quest 2 itself will take a lot more.\n\n# What now?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in deving AR on the index I guess you should look into WebXR\/MetaChromium and especially Aardvark. If you\u2019re a developer of a game like Cubism or Steady, where the environments aren\u2019t important to the gameplay, there is a way to render over passthrough in Unity even without Valve\u2019s official support. I would reach out to the team making Pluto and ask how to do it. If you're just a member of the community who knows how to code and wants to try making something cool, look into Aardvark and see if you can make something.\n\nI hope Valve makes this all official. I can\u2019t think of anything better right now than giving a set of huge new features to everyone who bought an Index. I hope they open it up to devs and offer the kind of support Facebook is offering and more. I hope they seed WebXR and Aardvark with some money to get things rolling. I hope they offer Jeri Ellsworth a boatload of money to handle their AR stuff or something and add compatibility with her TiltFive. I hope Valve makes SteamVR a general XR platform and uses AR as a way to explore that. I hope things like Aardvark can make PCVR a lot more usable both to increase how much people use PCVR and to create a new market for AR software. \n\nThey probably won\u2019t, and community efforts won\u2019t pick up enough momentum unless it can create some utility apps that people will pay for to get things moving. Valve is in a bubble where they think that because they\u2019re doing a lot, or because they\u2019ve done a lot, that they don\u2019t need to escalate to compete with Facebook. They also seem to unfairly expect a lot from the community without offering much help, like with SteamVR Home modding, Alyx modding, and generally expecting us to market VR and Alyx for them. It\u2019s also a dysfunctional nightmare inside that company, like the (ethical) foil to Zuck's dangerous dictatorship, and who knows how many people actually work on or care about VR, it could be a hundred or just ten incredibly productive people. Either way, if they don\u2019t see the bigger picture the next two years (and beyond) could be a disaster for everyone.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169652,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The Valve Index is an AR Headset","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/j3s494\/the_valve_index_is_an_ar_headset\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":true,"author":"[deleted]","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","can_gild":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1600216754,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"itlad9","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_itlad9","no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/itlad9\/vivecraft_with_keyboard_and_controller\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":"moderator","retrieved_utc":1622985235,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[removed]","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169642,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"default","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vivecraft with keyboard and controller","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/itlad9\/vivecraft_with_keyboard_and_controller\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":true,"author":"elvissteinjr","author_created_utc":1476536056,"author_flair_background_color":"#97ffff","author_flair_css_class":"dev cyantext","author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":"47f81fce-05b2-11e6-b225-0e53d596cc43","author_flair_text":"Desktop+ Overlay Developer","author_flair_text_color":"dark","author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_124yim","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1600029724,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"is6bey","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#f5f5f5","link_flair_css_class":"hdwmod thing viabutton cCKpMw","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_template_id":"b500d126-3c88-11e6-8fb2-0eaeca4c1ed3","link_flair_text":"hey \/r\/vive I made a thing!","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_is6bey","no_follow":false,"num_comments":9,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/is6bey\/desktop_a_free_and_advanced_desktop_overlay\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1622981846,"score":53,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hello once again, it's been a while.\n\nAnother 3 months have passed. And a few things have happened with Desktop+.\nAs you can see in the post title, Desktop+ is finally up there with the slightly bigger boys. It's now able to create and manage as many overlays as SteamVR allows it to!  \nNo direct video posts allowed here as usual, but [here](http:\/\/www.elvissteinjr.net\/dplus\/demo_v2_2_showcase.mp4)'s the video that was meant to go with this post.  \n\nBut if you've never heard of Desktop+ before: It's a free and open-source desktop overlay application providing a bunch of extra features while not bogging down your machine from running your VR games.\n\n- User interface with real-time adjustments accessible in VR or on desktop\n- Smooth, low-latency mirroring of desktops\n- Low memory footprint and performance impact\n- Multi-GPU support\n- Support for creating as many overlays as SteamVR allows at once\n- Customizable overlay settings (width, position, curvature, opacity), with switchable profiles\n- Overlay cropping\n- 3D support (SBS, HSBS, OU, HOU)\n- Overlay visibility and origin settings: Display a desktop during gameplay or attach it to a different origin (play space, dashboard, HMD, controllers, tracker)\n- Actions: User-definable functions (input simulation, running applications) which can be bound to controller or UI buttons\n- Keyboard Extension, enabling use of modifier, arrow and function keys\n- Elevated access toggle, making it possible to deal with UAC prompts and other UIP-restricted UI in VR without using full admin-access at all times\n- Gaze Fade, fade-out overlay when not looking at it\n- Scene application window auto-focus\n- Free and open source\n\nDesktop+ 2.2 mainly focuses on the new multi-overlay support, but there have also been some other additions.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n- Added multi- overlay support\n- Added support for Over-Under 3D\n- Added floating UI, quick access to visibility and position when hovering an overlay, as well as a customizable action bar\n- Added drag re-ordering support to action button list\n- Added overlay-specific update limiter override\n- Added desktop cropping to the overlay cropping tab\n- Added per-overlay action order setting\n- Added \"Enabled\" overlay setting &amp; \"Toggle Overlay Enabled State\" custom action function\n- Added \"Enable Input\" overlay setting\n- Added setting to automatically focus the current scene application when the dashboard is being deactivated\n- Added button- based press and release of press- key actions on the action \"Do\" button on the input settings page\n- Added settings interface display scale option\n- Changed desktop switching behavior to crop from the combined desktop by default, with an option to restore the old behavior in the Performance settings\n- Distance adjustment while dragging is now controller- oriented\n- Dashboard overlay now keeps being usable during drag mode\n- Keyboards for dashboard origin overlays are now shown as dashboard keyboards\n- Disabling auto interaction again now requires a small additional distance to avoid flickering between states\n- Enabled support for full Unicode range in UI\n- Re-arranged Overlay settings page with a tabbed interface\n- Fixed keyboard extension changing modifier state while hidden\n- Fixed render mouse setting change only applying after the next full duplication refresh\n- Fixed overlay jumping a long distance when starting a drag while holding down the scroll wheel\n- Fixed being unable to scroll custom action list right after creating a new action\n- Fixed UI flicker when resizing the dashboard overlay\n- Various other minor fixes and adjustments\n\nAs always, this version can be found on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nNow that Desktop+ has reached a state where it can reasonably recommended as a free alternative for a number of use-cases, I've decided open up a page for donations. I get it, the main appeal of Desktop+ is how it's free, and that will never change. It's just to see where it goes, not really expecting much from it. If you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).  \nNote that I will not paywall any releases or something like that, but if we really reach a substantial sum with this, I'll throw most of it at Valve for a Steam release (as a free app). Maybe some of you fancy that. Details of that plan are outlined on the page as well.\n\nDesktop+ certainly has reached a milestone with the long promised multi-overlay support, but it doesn't stop here of course. One major feature I want to tackle next is direct window captures. Cropping from the desktop is more efficient, but there's quite the appeal of not having to worry about windows being occluded by other windows. So that's something to look forward to, I suppose.\n\nLastly I'd also like to throw in some thanks to the fine people who helped testing this release: \/u\/Eg-GE, \/u\/gamert1 and \/u\/heclak.  \nThere were quite a few last minute fixes and changes thanks to them. If something's still broken, you now know who to yell at (me).\n\nSo there we have it. If there are any issues, let me know. I'm happy to help.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169637,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desktop+, a Free and Advanced Desktop Overlay, Version 2.2 with multi-overlay support now available","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.92,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/is6bey\/desktop_a_free_and_advanced_desktop_overlay\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":true,"author":"OXIOXIOXI","author_created_utc":1437501286,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_oyt3d","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1598726944,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"uploadvr.com","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"iixv5y","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"gm automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_iixv5y","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/iixv5y\/modbox_20_looks_a_lot_better_than_horizon_you_can\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"link","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"O3TbfKhj6yG9iRR_FZtXxICfufFz0i9uDY2ysZEWO14","resolutions":[{"height":60,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cc2ad4981dc793f9472574755fe12d3979f90a3","width":108},{"height":121,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6275fb4ff4d69ab7a5d41a0c8524682653590d1","width":216},{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f806f7cb815e0aad68ab2b309069b078ee61f42c","width":320},{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0593beb30126b0237b3c13b5bf14779342e55b3f","width":640},{"height":540,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5757afff0aabee382f154a8a339dc73c64cb204","width":960},{"height":607,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee16ca535b5864ac68bee98ba128f31c19e57c4b","width":1080}],"source":{"height":1080,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/uinZ_dy2BlZBLN93VMUCOp2EKVERVmgNV981z73_JMs.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b7205075df68b1d989751b9a2d4a21bd3ffd5048","width":1920},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1622960752,"score":18,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169638,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/JFDAk3OVERLvPj89-zzmtqOPiyfxXDVGtYma6rTa5fc.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"ModBox 2.0 looks a lot better than Horizon.

Now I have seen this similar post dozens of times and figured it was just me or my setup like other people suggested so never bother to post. Tonight it finally got on my nerves enough to do a little testing and something is definitely wrong, if I swing my right hand around fast the controller seems to drift out away from it's actual potion, a few times it just flew away, then when I stopped it would jitter around and then either snap back or drift back to the right potions. Doing the same with the controller in my left hand does not do this, it just tracks perfectly. If I switch controllers  the problem does not follow the controller, it stays on the right side, if I keep the controller in my right hand and cross it over to the left side of my body it seems to work fine. Also my base stations are setup to the sides of my play area, if I turn 180 degrees it still happens on my right side, so it doesn't seem to be the base stations either. My only guess is that it seems like the headset itself is causing this, I assume it has radios to talk to the controllers but is there one in each side? Do they hand off when the controllers switch sides? I have also seen some IMU over scale warnings in the logs but i would think that would be a problem with a specific controller, not both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate for anyone interested: (6\/28\/20)\n\n\\-I swapped out my wireless headphones (Corsair void pro wireless RGB) for a pair of wired ear buds this seems to have made a DRASTIC improvement, I can only assume the antenna is in the right side interfering with the controllers connection to the headset\n\n\\-If I hold the controllers by the very end and try to whip them around as hard and as erratically as I can I can still recreate the problem although not nearly as bad\n\n\\-tracking was good enough for me to pass a few \"Cameilla\" songs in beat saber that I never been able to clear before because the controller felt like it would desync (crystallized and light it up, expert difficulty if you play beat saber you know how much arm flailing that is)\n\n\\-while the problem still persists slightly as stated above it now seems to be from a specific side of the room, it could be the tv, although I am getting very few \"back facing hits\" (triple digits at the most, i have seen other peoples logs with over 10,000) so I am thinking that based on the above findings that it my be interference, that part of the room has a dehumidifier (high ac power draw could be electrically noisy ), a server, a large network switch, and a steam link with a wireless keyboard and mouse plugged in, I will have to do further testing with these things powered off\n\n\\-Final note every the tracking works fine with the \"default grip\" on the controllers however to try to increase my speed in beat saber I had tried switching to the \"x-grip\" and that make the problem come back in full force if not significantly worse [examples of the grips i'm talking about in case your new to that like me](https:\/\/bsmg.wiki\/grips-and-tricks.html#htc-vive-wands) I guess either the rotation of the controller or the fingers covering a sensor or two combine with the existing problem is just to much for it to resolve\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_subscribers":169618,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Vive right hand controller tracking problem, doesn't seem to matter which controller I use or where the base stations are","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.88,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/hg2t0w\/vive_right_hand_controller_tracking_problem\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":true,"archived":true,"author":"cicada-man","author_created_utc":1338958847,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_7wu9t","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1592559955,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"hbxtth","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"qt","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_hbxtth","no_follow":false,"num_comments":91,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/hbxtth\/how_long_should_i_keep_my_og_vive\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1622875733,"score":83,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"My current setup is an OG HTC Vive paired with Index Controllers, an AMD Ryzen 2600 and a Radeon RX 580.

That night I tried it and played for several hours. This is my feedback, and my advice for anyone that was considering doing the same.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThis feedback is about two things: My experience with Mother VR and my experience with asking for advice on this forum.\n\nMother VR:\n\nThe modder did a great job with this, but he's not finished and seems to have abandoned the project.\n\nIf you enjoy a VR experience free of frequent immersion-breaking bugs, Mother VR is not for you. If you are able to tolerate the absence of some stock VR features like motion-tracking aiming, I STILL won't recommend Mother VR to you because I can tolerate that as well, that's not the problem I have; the problem I have is the frequent immersion-breaking bugs.\n\nAsking for advice on this forum: ...very strange experience.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\nSo in the post I made before I asked for advice about Mother VR, and I want to highlight the disparity between what I was told and what I experienced. In doing so I will also highlight my experience with Mother VR so I can kill two birds with one stone.\n\n&gt;VR in fantastic. I suggest playing with a controller en when the game had booted up take one step forward to center the body model.\n\nThis isn't that simple.\n\nThe character model was left in the game but it doesn't track to your headset. So if you turn your body at all, eventually your position will de-sync with the model and you will have ghost textures at the bottom of your vision. This happens frequently and is very distracting.\n\nThe only solution is to use the controller to do skip-turning. I, personally, *hate* skip-turning, but if you like it, this shouldn't be an issue for you.\n\n&gt;I don't get motion sick with every game on full locomotion, so the interactions are sometimes a bit uneasy, but 1 second later i'm OK again. If you are easily motion sick then it might be a problem.\n\nThis is true. The forced head movement is a big problem. I don't get sick so it's not a problem for me, but I image that if you do it will be fairly jarring. This doesn't happen frequently, but it happens fairly often.\n\n&gt;using computers takes a bit of getting used to\n\nThis is a *hell* of an understatement. When you use a computer, which you have to do *all the time*, your perspective jumps to center, which rarely happens to be facing the computer. This is a major immersion-breaking bug and it happens every few minutes. Not only does this happen with computers, but it happens with almost everything you interact with: computers, save points, magnetic locks, generators, etc.\n\n&gt;the original devs were implementing vr support but dropped it. mother vr isn't a wonky hack\n\nIt IS a wonky hack. It's a *very good* wonky hack! But it's a wonky hack nonetheless. Just because it's based on functionality the devs *began* to implement but never finished doesn't mean it's not a wonky hack. A lot of it is hacky (which is not necessarily bad) and a lot of it is wonky (definitely bad).\n\nThis might sound petty, but it's not: this comment let me to believe I wasn't dealing with a wonky hack, which totally distorted my expectations.\n\n&gt;If you played Subnautica in VR then I think it\u2019s less janky than that port.\n\nSubnautica definitely had issues but they were all things you could learn how to deal with then they were in the past. Once you figured out how to do things, the worst problem you had was an inventory screen that was a little too close. In contrast Alien Isolation has this interaction bug that happens every couple minutes on average and there is no way around it.\n\nI was shocked at how wrong this user was.\n\n&gt;The best way was to play seated with mouse &amp; keyboard ... its awesome!\n\nThis is actually a weird way to frame a bad thing as a good thing. It's better to sit down because you don't get the character model ghost textures problem. This should be phrased as, in my opinion, \"You have to sit down to play because your character model causes vision problems if you stand.\" The way it's phrased hides the fact that there is a major bug. Why would you do that? I don't know.\n\nAnyway, I tried sitting. It fixes the ghost texture problem, but introduces a new one. First, you can't turn in your chair because you're tethered to your keyboard (and if you're wired like I am it will wrap and catch). This makes the computer interaction camera-centering problem worse. I wouldn't recommend it. Additionally, it makes you feel like you're a child in a miniature environment for some reason, but that's relatively minor.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nAsking for advice here was a very strange experience. I came away with the feeling that half the users were trying to *sell* me this experience. I can only guess at why, but I think it's because they're excited about VR and want other people to be excited about it, too? That's cool, but when someone's asking for advice or a review, fanboying at them is the last thing they need; you're only going to inflate their expectations and when they are let down they'll be worse off than if they had never bought into your pitch in the first place.\n\nIf you want to try Alien Isolation in VR but you aren't willing to put up with a good amount of major, frequent, immersion-breaking bugs, Mother VR is not your solution.

Sure looks like it.  \nNo direct video posts allowed here, but [here](http:\/\/www.elvissteinjr.net\/dplus\/demo_v2_1_showcase.mp4)'s the video that was meant to go with this post.  \nThe video isn't exactly meant to impress, but I wanted to try a more visual approach so it's a bit more obvious what's new in Desktop+ and how those features can be used.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Desktop+ yet, it's a free and open-source alternative desktop overlay aiming to step up SteamVR's default one in responsiveness and features while not bogging down your machine from running your VR games.\n\n- User interface with real-time adjustments accessible in VR or on desktop\n- Smooth, low-latency mirroring of desktops\n- Low memory footprint and performance impact\n- Multi-GPU support\n- Customizable overlay settings (width, position, curvature, opacity), with switchable profiles\n- Overlay cropping\n- 3D support (SBS &amp; HSBS)\n- Floating overlay mode: Display a desktop during gameplay or attach it to a different origin (play space, dashboard, HMD, controllers, tracker)\n- Actions: User-definable functions (input simulation, running applications) which can be bound to controller or UI buttons\n- Keyboard Extension, enabling use of modifier, arrow and function keys\n- Elevated access toggle, making it possible to deal with UAC prompts and other UIP-restricted UI in VR without using full admin-access at all times\n- Gaze Fade, fade-out overlay when not looking at it\n- Free and open source\n\nDesktop+ 2.1 is no massive upgrade, but it's adding a couple of useful features, as well as improving responsiveness and performance.\n\nSo here's what's new:\n\n- Added basic overlay profile support\n- Added two-handed gesture transform drag mode\n- Added floating overlay auto interaction toggle\n- Added Gaze Fade, fade-out overlay when not looking at it\n- Added FPS-based update limiter\n- Added \"Crop to Active Window\" action and settings button\n- Duplication is now suspended completely when overlay not visible (previously, load was minimized, but now it's pretty much 0)\n- Small UI Adjustments\n- Detached overlays are now called floating overlays in the UI\n- Improved responsiveness when limiting updates\n- Improved performance on partial screen updates and cropped overlays\n- Improved responsiveness for global shortcuts\n- Fixed dropping detached overlay state from SteamVR Input binding while using the detached overlay interaction binding\n- Fixed using WMR-specific settings after switching to a non-WMR HMD\n- Fixed Desktop+ UI launching twice when restarting from the troubleshooting button while in desktop mode\n- Fixed laser pointer mouse using old offsets after screen arrangement changes\n- Fixed wrong initial transform for HMD Floor Position overlay origin\n- ...and several even smaller fixes\n\nAs always, this version can be found on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nRegarding what the future holds, I will finally start working on multi-overlay support for the next release. I expect this to require quite some adjustments in the code as well as some time.  \nSo what I decided to do was to provide preview builds as soon as the bare minimum functionality is present.  \nThey will be posted in this [GitHub issue](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/issues\/3) for those who really need multiple overlays as soon as possible or are just curious. While there won't be anything interesting there for probably a couple of weeks, you can follow it if you're interested to be notified when something happens.\n\nThat's all from me.

guys\n\nI\u2019ve had my original vive coming up to two years,I had given it a rest for about a year and decided yesterday to re-set it up and get back into it.\nI plugged everything in,downloaded steamVr and got the error headset not detected (208)\n\nI didn\u2019t pack away the lighthouses and just left them plugged in while the vive was in storage.The lighthouses are showing all the correct colours (green) and the controllers show they\u2019re connected with the solid green colour when turned on.\nWhen running room set-up through streamVR  controllers stay a solid green but are blacked out on the screen where it shows the headset &amp; controllers connected same as the headset.\nHeadset also has power to it ,but the light on the left side is a solid red. \n\nI have spent hours upon hours trying to find a solution for this problem,going down the rabbit hole of google and reddit for all fixes with nothing to change.\n\n-Different USB ports\n-Different HDMI Ports\n-plugging headset into the pc bypassing the box\n-reinstall of drivers\/video drivers\n-reinstall of steamvr\n-replacing all the cables,including the cables coming from the headset itself\n-unplugging all USB devices apart from mouse and keyboard\n-resetting headset\n\nJust to name a few things I\u2019ve tried.\n\nI\u2019m really running out of ideas and starting to think it is dead, does anyone have any ideas before I try send it back to HTC?\n\nIn the time since I last used the vive,I have built another PC with a new CPU &amp; mobo\nAlso I have added a second monitor but I don\u2019t think any of that

have always thought the Vive Pro doesn't do sunlight well in outdoor, sunny environments, and it hurt immersion and made it look like the wrong time of day. Here is a reddit post showing that the Pro is less bright than the original Vive.\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/8c4luc\/vive\\_pro\\_vs\\_vive\\_screen\\_brightness\\_and\\_color\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/8c4luc\/vive_pro_vs_vive_screen_brightness_and_color\/)\n\nWell, after years of trying to find a hack or way to increase the Pro's brightness, I have finally found one.\n\nAll you have to do is get openVR advanced settings. Newer versions have a video tab, which has a brightness slider. This is only used to lower the brightness below 100%, but, there are color sliders that can go above 100%. It isn't their default behavior, so you have to click the number for each color to enter a new value in with the SteamVR keyboard. You can enter values above 100 this way, and it increases the brightness of the headset. Then save your profile in that video tab.\n\nI am using 150, and it's making outdoor bright areas actually look bright.\n\n \n\nsteam:

Steam provides a trusted platform, as well as a fricitonless update path.\n  - The project **is** identical on both Github and Steam.\n  - As updating Steam is not completely automatic, there may be slight delays from GitHub -&gt; Steam (think ~1 hour)\n  - **tl;dr** we are remaining FOSS, and Steam is simply an additional distribution platform.\n\n- Where do I report Bugs?\n  - [GitHub] (https:\/\/github.com\/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings\/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings\/issues)\n  - [Discord](https:\/\/discordapp.com\/invite\/vgvSkSk)\n\n\n### Some Things have moved\n\n- Snap, Smooth, and Space Turn have been moved to the new Rotation Tab\n- In Bindings the simulated clicks have been moved to a new tab called `system`\n- In Bindings the PTT has been moved to a new tab called `system`\n- The Prox Sensor, and Haptic Actions have been hidden from end-user\n  - They are bound by default, and should not be adjusted.\n\n### New Features\n\n- Rotation Tab [feilen](https:\/\/github.com\/feilen) UI by [ykeara](https:\/\/github.com\/ykeara)\n  - Auto-Turn - Automatically rotates you to allow you to walk in a single direction forever in games by rotating the world around you as you near walls.\n    - optionally this feature will also try to direct you so that you will untangle your cord as well.\n    - **important** - This feature does not handle playspaces with wall corners greater than 180 degrees well.\n  - redirected - walking - Automatically steers you away from the edge of your play area by encouraging you to walk towards the middle of your play area.\n    - **Important** - This requires a VERY large playspace to be imperceptible, its best use is for extending your perceived length of your play area slightly. \n\n- Friction - when using Space Drag features. A value of 100% will bring the user to a full stop within roughly 1 second. The max value is 999% and min is 0%.

But this is a thing of the past now.\n\nVersion 2.0 comes with a bunch of new things, including...\n\n* UI, for real-time changes of settings as well accessing user-defined actions\n* Multi-GPU support, mainly relevant for laptops, but perhaps also the oddball with desktops spread across them\n* Swapped mouse buttons supported\n* Customizable overlay curvature\n* Overlay 3D modes (SBS &amp; HSBS)\n* Detached overlay mode, view your desktop during gameplay or attach it to some spot in the play space\n* Actions, user-definable functions (input simulation, running applications) which can be bound to controller or UI buttons\n* Intersection blob toggle\n* Keyboard extension ~~(experimental)~~(Valve fixed outstanding issues in the latest OpenVR SDK), enabling use of modifier, arrow and function keys\n* Performance Stats\n* Elevated access toggle, making it possible to deal with UAC prompts and the likes in VR without going full admin-access at all times\n* Actually delivering on the empty promise of open-sourcing the thing (well, on public release)\n* General compatibility and bug fixes, quite a few of those\n\n[Last time](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/d2j3kx\/looking_for_testers_for_an_alternative_desktop\/) I set out some requirements for testing, but this time it's pretty much a free for all.  \nI do however ask you to have basic computer skills (know what you're running and how to extract an archive, yeah) and the ability to read the included readme file. I like helping out but needlessly repeating stuff is silly.  \nIt would also be great if you could test beyond just checking if it runs.  \nOh, and still Windows 8+ only, due to the APIs used in this.\n\nYou may have noticed there's a semi-important game release imminent. I'm well aware and it's actually the reason why I'm posting now.  \nDesktop+ 2.0 isn't 100% ready just yet, but it's close. I wanted to get some testers before the sub drowned in Half-Life posts.  \nI'm expecting it to be ready during the next week, though I'll be \"busy\" as well, just like many of you. \n\nI know that testing this doesn't really come with much benefit as opposed to testing a paid app and keeping it afterwards and it's also not quite as fancy as the commercial solutions, but I hope a few of you can help me out there.  \nWould hate to release something that ends up not running on half of the systems somehow.\n\nRegarding screenshots and stuff... I'm lazy and will make some during the testing period. There's somewhat dated stuff on my Twitter [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/elvissteinjr\/status\/1198812527607586818) and [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/elvissteinjr\/status\/1218016495034343426), however.\n\nAnyways if any of you are up to it, leave a comment or send a private message. I'll hit you up with something once I have it ready.  \nThanks!\n\nEdit:  \nJust wanted to mention that even if I don't respond to your comment, you'll be receiving something when it's ready. Responding to everyone with the same thing for that seems silly.\n\nOh and while I'll gladly answer anything regarding what Desktop+ can or can't do, this thing is pretty much in a feature freeze now in order to actually get something out again. Just as a heads up.\n\nEdit 2:  \nI have about 10 people now, which should be more than enough. Thanks for helping out here.  \nUnless you have some very special setup it's probably not worth signing yourself up now. Look forward to the release, which may or may not be soon depending on the test results.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":141673,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desktop+, a Free and Advanced Desktop Overlay, looking for Version 2.0 Testers","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/fmn22i\/desktop_a_free_and_advanced_desktop_overlay\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"anonthrowaway683","author_created_utc":1544625620,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_2rrot4md","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1584737194,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"fm2fgy","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"hdw automod","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/fm2fgy\/anyway_to_emulate_vive_controller_button_presses\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587703563,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I don't need to emulate the whole controller and it's motion I just need a way to map a keyboard or wiimote button to a button on a Vive controller for steam VR.

Locomoting and playing and everything just fine.\n\nI honestly think that everyone in the VR space should get this game. It\u2019s 50% right now and $10 for a program with effectively unlimited content that you can play with people all over the world in VR or on flat screen, is just insane. You have to take the time to understand the controls, but once you get it working for you it\u2019s pretty smooth.\n\nThe controls take a little getting used to but seriously, once you do it\u2019s insanely nice and I had the most relaxed and chilled experience I ever have in VR and as long as you have at least one non VR person to do the few things that are harder to do in VR it\u2019s pretty great. For example, with my binding, I turned on wall mode, which meant that as I laid back, I was facing forward where the board was rotated 90% on the Z axis, I could pick stuff up the normal VR way, or I could rest my finger on my trigger and a laser pointer would shoot out which acted like a mouse cursor so I could interact with objects the same way as other people, grabbing things remotely and dragging. It actually works a lot better on the index somehow. I played card games with the cards floating above my left hand, etc. Ironically it felt like the game controlled better while I was on the couch than when I was playing the way you would expect.\n\nI still believe a native boardgame simulator for VR should be made, but honestly playing board games in a more relaxing and comfortable way through VR is not something I thought was even possible. My mind is kind of blown.\n\nIf you don\u2019t play a lot of board games, should you get this? I think you should. At the current price it\u2019s kind of a no brainer, performance is good (lower all the settings to their lowest since they don\u2019t really do much that\u2019s noticeable in VR and game textures are fixed), you can open the rules for games in your desktop view or in the included rulebooks, the UI can be janky but completely usable (you can have the flat screen UI on your wrist, on the wall, or as a floating object around you that you can drag and place where you want in 3D space. If people have any interest whatsoever, I made a list of VR games that hold up in 2020, I would be happy to make another list for board games that are great and work in VR. (If you don\u2019t know about board games these days, there are thousands and thousands of designer board games that are basically as heavily reviewed and iterated as video games and most of them defy the stereotypes of board games on TV)\n\nShould you try this program if you like boardgames but haven\u2019t tried TTS? Yes, of course. Should you try VR if you like board games and don\u2019t like mouse and keyboard (or even if you do)? This is a little harder to say. I loved playing with my Index controllers and I think Oculus and even windows mixed reality controllers would work well. My Vive Wands were more frustrating because they were less ergonomic in this position and had fewer inputs. My index is also comfortable enough that after 14 hours my face didn\u2019t even really hurt much (I stopped because I was tired as hell). If you like board games and haven\u2019t tried VR or it seems like the opposite of what you like, I think this is like when people started playing Diplomacy by email. It\u2019s not what anyone thought of when they thought \u201ccomputer game\u201d but it worked really well and become a hit with board game people. I honestly felt way more social in VR than I felt in any flat screen board game app or program (but you can play in flat screen just fine and the program was designed mostly for that) and in VR I could just look up or around and select things from far away or flick my wrist to move up to something and read it. This may all be hard to describe and I wish I knew how to capture and post game footage well to explain. I\u2019ll try and collect some screen shots and attach them.\n\n\nTL;DR: Playing board games can be one of the most chill and casually fun experiences in VR, I played laying flat on my couch playing with one hand behind my head and one doing everything in the game from moving to interacting to typing (including holding something and moving with the same hand). It\u2019s also a way to play board games that\u2019s super chill and certain aspects I honestly liked better than playing in real life even though I\u2019m a huge board games person and have a hundred games on my shelves.

I have 4 trackers (I\u2019ll call them trackers (A), (B), (C), and (D)) I have an extra just in case one of the trackers broke. I\u2019ve never had to depend on the extra tracker to use full body tracking.\n\nThree months ago was the last time I used my vr trackers. Last night I booted up VRchat and tried to use my trackers and trackers (A), (B), and (C) would all connect. But every time tracker (A) connected it would cause my mouse to frantically move back and forth all over my screen, while 8-10 programs at once would start to open plus Windows 10 Accessibility Features like narrator and the on screen keyboard. I kept having to hard reset to fix this.\n\nBut the night was young so I then tried to connect my extra vr tracker. But only trackers (B) and (C) would connect together or trackers (C) and (D) would connect. I fixed this temporally by using developer mode and resetting the usb connection and restarting. Only to discover now that if the trackers were connected (trackers (B) + (C) + (D)), my Index controllers would be detected but not connect. I restarted my computer again only for my Index controller to work + tracker (C) or no Index controllers and only trackers (B) + (D) would connect. I tried to connect each tracker using the usb, and holding power for 10 seconds but this did nothing to fix or change the situation.\n\nI tried to look into tracker (A)\u2019s problem, and I can\u2019t find anyone with anything close to the experience I\u2019ve had with mouse and programs losing control. And for trackers (B), (C), or (D) I don\u2019t know what else I can do about them all not connecting together + the index controllers.\n\nHas anyone had something like this happen to them, or know of a solution that I haven\u2019t come across of yet? Also does anyone knows of a way to actually factory reset a tracker? (Not just the general reset of plug into pc and hold power for 10 seconds. I could not find anything on google for a solution on how to factory reset a tracker)\n\nTLDR:- I have 4 trackers (A), (B), (C), and (D)- Tracker (A) when connected moves my mouse all over the place, instantly opens up 8-10 programs and turns on window 10 accessibility features.  \nTrackers (B), (C), and (D) would not all connect together.   \nEither both (B) + (C) only or (C) + (D) would connect at the same time.   \nAfter troubleshooting (B), (C), and (D) would connect but the Index controllers would not.   \nAfter only Index controllers and tracker (C) or tracker (B) + tracker (C) would be able to connect at the same time.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Vive","subreddit_id":"t5_378go","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Vive","subreddit_subscribers":141291,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"4 VR Trackers, 1 tracker opens up random programs and frantically moves the mouse, and the other 3 wont connect all together.","total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vive\/comments\/f89xil\/4_vr_trackers_1_tracker_opens_up_random_programs\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"OMEGA27304","author_created_utc":1431587326,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_ngs1a","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1582279314,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.Vive","edited":1582283434,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"f79072","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":"vd","link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":"Video","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":false,"num_comments":46,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/Vive\/comments\/f79072\/give_away_been_working_on_a_vr_coop_pizza_making\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"YX4QJlKz-fh7EeVrvgGKvzmFD9B0-RdBWMjI1UhKgic","resolutions":[{"height":81,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/s32gxbxpcHZ2xZyFJMJoafRxhaSU1G91eMlE5iVFEhI.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f9eda539e202f4fa5833352ecb7a48536f978f2d","width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/s32gxbxpcHZ2xZyFJMJoafRxhaSU1G91eMlE5iVFEhI.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16825d6f05c818851b30650f9710d67fecd52a9b","width":216},{"height":240,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/s32gxbxpcHZ2xZyFJMJoafRxhaSU1G91eMlE5iVFEhI.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5121f02077346291047847d027056f0cbd34ba3","width":320}],"source":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/s32gxbxpcHZ2xZyFJMJoafRxhaSU1G91eMlE5iVFEhI.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=d7399a399d04496a722ce991b078f5b30ac39630","width":480},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587444961,"score":29,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Pizza Master VR is a fast paced pizza making game for Virtual Reality.

discovered u\/LukeRoss\u2019s [R.E.A.L. VR](https:\/\/github.com\/LukeRoss00\/gta5-real-mod) mod for Grand Theft Auto V, I\u2019ve practically become a citizen of Los Santos as it lives and breathes. The detail in this game is truly a spectacle and an absolute treat in virtual reality.\n\nI\u2019ve been adding a host of other mods to the game and have had few issues up to this point, which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe primary mods I\u2019ve been playing with are:\n\n[Menyoo Trainer](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/menyoo-pc-sp)\n\n[World of Variety](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/misc\/world-of-variety)\n\n[Manual Transmission + Steering Wheel Support](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/manual-transmission-ikt)(with Logitech G920)\n\n[Natural Vision](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/misc\/naturalvision-photorealistic-gtav)\n\n[Open All Interiors](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/open-all-interiors)\n\n[Red House](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/the-red-house-end-game-missions)\n\n[Drift Assist](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/drift-assist)\n\n[Dispatch Works](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/vehicles\/dispatchworks-pack-add-on-oiv-tuning-liveries)\n\n[Lively World](https:\/\/www.gta5-mods.com\/scripts\/lively-world)\n\n\nThe one problem I was having was that some of these mods rely on keyboard shortcuts, which can be problematic when using a 360 controller and steering wheel. \n\nMemories from playing Elite Dangerous back when I first got the Vive came to mind. That game had so much going on that it was just overwhelming (also very cool!) in VR. Here is where [Voice Attack](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/583010\/VoiceAttack\/) comes into play. For those of you who may be unaware, Voice Attack allows you to use your microphone to trigger all kinds of events on your PC. \n\nSo I took a few minutes to add vocal commands that emulate key presses and my problem of having to take off the Vive every time I wished to press a button (or several) on the keyboard has been dissolved.\n\nFor example, vocal commands for opening up the steering wheel mod menu, opening the trainer, or toggling the render mode easily for those who would rather improved clarity over the perfect sense of scale.\n\nIf I yell a profanity, auto honk. You get the idea. \nI highly recommend checking out GTA VR with the R.E.A.L. mod even if you have qualms about it not having motion controller support. The game is stunning and runs rather well.\n\nFor reference, I\u2019m running the [R.E.A.L.
