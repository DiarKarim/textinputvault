If I compare PCVR quest 3 and index side by side it feels like I'm swimming in jelly on quest 3 and have ninja reflexes on index. \n\nBut alright, maybe quest 3 is nice as a standalone device despite everything? Maybe I can use it as a quick to put on beat saber box? Surprisingly no, when set to 120hz, native beat saber on expert+ drops frames like every 10 seconds. And turns out this is not just my unit, google \"quest 3 beat saber lags\". \n\nAnd don't even start me on comfort... This thing has just these fabric straps that put all the weight on your face, I can't use it for longer than 10 minutes, and I can use index for hours. Even quest 1 was more comfortable, I remember using it for 8+ hours a day in the lockdown vrchat era. \n\nAlso the controllers feel like they are going to fly away when I play fast maps in beat saber, they are very small and I really need to focus on holding them tightly.\n\nThis is disappointing and I feel like I got totally Zucked. The quest 3 is miles better visually, no questions asked, but is worse in every other department. I'll test it for a few days more but I'll end up returning it. Or keep it for quest exclusives, like the recent kurzgesagt thing? But it definitely is not replacing index as my main VR system, sadly.","author_fullname":"t2_1lixa05d","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Anyone else disappointed with quest 3?","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17ptaix","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Discussion","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1699360479.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.ValveIndex","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is made to warn index owners who think of getting quest 3, and maybe get some validation of these issues since 95% of quest 3 talk I could find was only praising it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the clarity and resolution are amazing.

friends - just wanted to share how excited and happy my mom was to try VR for the first time and ofc popped her in the highly recommended skyrim Vr experience and it didnt dissappoint. Im still taken aback at how amazing the mod community and overall the VR community is on here. So many of you go out of your way to give tips \/advice and everything from maintenance of these devices to set up and even common bug solutions to expect to arise. What I imagined to be a complicated set up ended up being a breeze with all of your answers\/ tutorials \/tips etc. and the mods from people like Cangar etc. are incredible! Reading and looking at the posts in this community convinced me to pull the trigger and invest in one of these and Im so glad I did. I see how much effort you guys put in helping and introducing new people like me to VR expecting nothing back and hope you know how grateful us newcomers are!! \n\nFor context in the video I gave my mom two OP followers to act as bodyguards as she learned the controls and she immedately started stabbing them instead \ud83e\udd23 and I just love her reaction to seeing flames come out of her hand in game. Shes using all your tips to slowly get over motion sickness and cant wait till she can play for longer sessions. VR is whats convincing her to explore the gaming world and im so excited for her to experience the games I grew up on.

Just wanted to leave this here in case anyone else was having trouble like me with stuttering in VR. I noticed recently that VR seemed to not be a smooth experience for me anymore with my 1080ti, I chalked it up to my card's age at first. But just recently, the stuttering got so much more severe. There were black frames flickering occassionally in gameplay, it seemed unstable even on games that aren't super demanding.\n\nAnyways, I did some work to eliminate that awful black frame flicker and I managed to get rid of it by first removing my overclock (It was modest anyways +50 for both memory and core), though I did keep my increased power and temp limits. This increased stability somewhat but it was still flickering occasionally.\n\nThis next one is very specific but I was overclocking my second monitor to 76hz from its default 1080p60. I reverted that so it was running at its normal refresh rate of 60hz.  This greatly reduced the black frames, it almost completely eliminated them. I was about to just call it and say good enough, but I also wanted to try reverting to old drivers to see if that could improve things.\n\nLet me just say that this was a complete night and day difference. Even forgetting about the black frame problem (which was completely solved by this), all that stuttering I had become used to over time was just gone. For example, Half Life Alyx, I remember that in the intro sequence with the valve logo and the white screen always had some annoying stutter in it, and the game in general stuttered for me enough for it to be annoying, but not enough to be unplayable. Stutter was basically entirely eliminated by reverting drivers to 446.14, and changing from Vulkan to DX11 only made it even better. I tested a few other games and the stutter was just gone.\n\nI don't know yet how this affects pancake games as I've only tested it in VR but wow. I wish I found this much sooner.\n\nI will say there is some risk here in regards to security when using such an old driver, as some very large vulnerabilities have been fixed since this driver has been released, so use this at your own risk.\n\nI found that specific driver from this post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/o90ftc\/nvidia\\_driver\\_44614\\_is\\_still\\_the\\_best\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/o90ftc\/nvidia_driver_44614_is_still_the_best\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nTry it out and leave a comment on how it goes! Or if you are using another driver that works for you leave it here so others can give it a try!\n\nEdit: apparently the black flickering was an issue with steamVR and just got fixed with an update; details here: https:\/\/steamdb.info\/patchnotes\/10835175\/\n\nStuttering definitely is reduced by reverting though, so there still is that","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":84476,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PSA for 10\/20 series nvidia card owners","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/120yvdh\/psa_for_1020_series_nvidia_card_owners\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"codephoenix525","author_created_utc":1448849301,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_sjetz","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1679348648,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"11wx186","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_metadata":{"8ls0xqb0syoa1":{"e":"Image","id":"8ls0xqb0syoa1","m":"image\/png","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ls0xqb0syoa1.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6f5d475f2275fd4cdb701c55030fbf8da937b279","x":108,"y":49},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ls0xqb0syoa1.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b631ce95ef0c4444447ec691165f4be434644836","x":216,"y":99},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ls0xqb0syoa1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e375cfa1302ba2fec2218cc8dbeafab6e115fefe","x":320,"y":148},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ls0xqb0syoa1.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=854deefe0d8c471aa6b2495008c07da7f0fc39a3","x":640,"y":296}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/8ls0xqb0syoa1.png?width=957&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cf10e3072c1a2198bbd5d2a2edb393ef246ba4e0","x":957,"y":443},"status":"valid"}},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_11wx186","no_follow":true,"num_comments":2,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/11wx186\/make_sure_you_dont_cancel_the_rma_process_at_any\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1681001240,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"For context, last year my Right Index Controller stopped holding a charge. I was only able to play if I had a long USB cable coming from my PC to the controller (plugging it into the Frunk was also a viable way to play). My Index was already out of warranty by the time this happened, but I decided to open a support ticket with Steam Support. After some troubleshooting and back and forths with the Support team, they finally started the RMA process and sent a shipping label. But, something happened when I tried playing it again before shipping it out.\n\nThe controller somehow worked like new again. The battery was holding a charge and played for a few hours. I was very confused, but decided to hold off on sending the controller thinking it worked again. I had planned on testing it again the next few days, but life got in the way and those days turned into weeks and I didn't really touch VR during that time. Then I got a notification that the support ticket closed. Immediately I go to test the controller again and the problem returned. The battery stopped charging.\n\nLife was still the way so I didn't get the chance to open another support ticket. Fast forward a year, I moved, holidays and job issues took a huge strain on my life, but things finally settled down and I decided to attempt this again. I put all the details in my support ticket, saying my warranty expired and I had another ticket open with the RMA process to try and speed things along, but then I got hit with this message:\n\n&gt;Hello,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for contacting Steam Support.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As you already know, the warranty for this controller is no longer valid.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We processed this RMA for you over 1 year and 3 months ago.

I adore my Index, and I love playing VR games.\n\n***--*** ***Visuals --***\n\n*Screendoor:* A lot of people (including me, initially) are confusing screendoor with Mura, I don't think this headset has a particularly bad screen door effect, I hardly notice it at all.  What it does have, is very noticeable Mura (It looks like constant film grain, except it doesn't move) in games that are running at a lower than native resolution.  Index wins here, in terms of clarity, Index is better.\n\n*Sharpness:* This varies from game to game, GT7 is extremely sharp and beautiful; full immersion, nothing like it. Horizon Call of the Mountain is a bit blurry, No Man's Sky is a blurry mess, RE8 is pretty sharp.  My guess is that they're rendering the game at a low res and aggressive with antialiasing, it reminds me of how blurry Hitman 3 is on PCVR, because in GT7 and cinema mode there's zero blur, it's gorgeous, and sharp. PSVR2 takes the win here, text is much more readable, sharper, even the small tiny gauges and instruments in GT7 are perfectly readable without getting close or straining your eyes.\n\n*God Rays:* PSVR2 only has God Rays when you're looking at white text on a black screen, and even then they are minimal.  All the games I played have zero God Rays.  Big win for PSVR2 here.\n\n*FOV:* Index by a hair, I was very pleasantly surprised by the PSVR2's FOV, even without pushing the lenses all the way up to my face I was getting FOV comparable to Index; I never feel like I am wearing a scuba mask like in the old CV1 days.\n\n*Colors\/Blacks\/Brightness:* PSVR2 unfortunately has Mura, but the colors are gorgeous and vibrant, it has true blacks, and the brightness is perfect.  In cinema mode it looks better than my 1080p 65\" TV, I still love the Index, and I'm happy with the image quality, but if you do an A\/B comparison the PSVR2 takes the win on this one.  In the Index colors look a tiny big washed out in comparison.\n\n**-- Sweet Spot --**\n\nIndex has a larger sweet spot, at least easier to find.  PSVR has a good sweet spot but it's noticeably smaller and it requires readjusting the headset often if you lose it.  I hardly every have to adjust my Index once it's on.  Part of the problem is how you put it on and take it off.\n\n**-- Design and Finish --**\n\nNo contest, the Index is much better designed, you can set it and forget it once you've found your perfect comfort setting.  On the PSVR you have to use the ratchet and button combo to adjust it from scratch every time.  Putting it on is much more awkward, you also run the risk of accidentally changing the IPD because your finger touches the super sensitive IPD wheel.\n\nThe Index feels like a premium product, the PSVR2 uses cheap plastics and it feels like a toy, the slider for the screens feels super flimsy.\n\n**-- Comfort --**\n\nThis is a tie; I think the Index is maybe more comfortable overall; my issues with the PSVR2 when it comes to comfort might have to do with overtightening it so maybe long term I'll feel different.  I will say, long sessions, I barely felt the weight of the PSVR2 on my head, whereas the Index lets you know it's there after an hour.\n\n**-- Sound --**\n\nLet's get this out of the way, the Index has a premium, groundbreaking audio solution; the PSVR2 comes with two cheap earbuds.  The sound quality is fine (I'm not an audiophile), but every time I use it I miss not having to worry about sound because the Index speakers are right there by my ears ready to rock; with the PSVR I forget to put on my earbuds until after I'm already in a game lol\n\n**-- Controller --**\n\nKnuckles are still king, I missed not being able to fully open my hands. Not much else to say, but that's because the Knuckles are so much better it's not worth wasting time litigating this.\n\n**-- Tracking --**\n\nFlawless on Index, ~~worse than I expected on PSVR 2; when I draw arrows too fast in Horizon my hands go all over the place, even if I keep my head too still for too long the PSVR2 kind of freaks out and takes me out of the game because it says it can't track and to try again.  I've been taken out of every single game I've played so far because the headset stops tracking altogether, my hands are sometimes all over the place in some games (in Resident Evil it was impossible to aim the gun in several places because the hands were freaking out).~~\n\n~~I don't know why I'm having so many tracking issues, I have the light on in my room, it's not a huge room and my Index base stations are on standby (I'm going to try flat out unplugging them tonight...maybe that's what's messing with it)~~\n\nMy tracking issues seem to have been caused by my Index base stations (even on stand-by) I unplugged them as well as the Index itself and the tracking on PSVR is MUCH better.  It's not flawless like Index, but it's far better than it was before.  I still have issues when the controllers are somewhat occluded, and it has a hard time sometimes just tracking the room space, but it's perfectly acceptable now.\n\n**-- Haptics --**\n\nI completely forgot to mention this because frankly it's kind of forgettable.  Edge goes to PSVR2 because having haptics on the headset is actually quite cool, in certain situations it enhances the gameplay; for the most part, I forget they're there and doesn't really do much.\n\nI personally feel the haptics on the Sense controllers are overhyped, they don't feel any different than the Knuckles to me; the Knuckles have excellent haptics.\n\nFor the triggers, the adaptive triggers are nice and I do notice them in certain gameplay moments, I like it, I never liked them on the Dual Sense and I turned me off almost immediately but I do think they add immersion to VR, it's just not something that I think is any sort of game changer.  The Index already has two-stage triggers that I feel get the job done just as well, but yes, the adaptive part definitely edges out the Knuckles here as well.  Frankly none of this is relevant because the tracking is so bad it takes away from all these icing on the cake type features.\n\n**-- Unique Features --**\n\nPSVR2 takes the win here.  The passthru cameras are awesome, it's trippy to see my surroundings in the headset with very good depth perception.  It's also super helpful.  Eye tracking is a bit of an underrated killer feature, I think, foveated rendering is fantastic to keep performance high and the games looking gorgeous, eye tracking in menus is a genius feature I hope every developer embraces, no more stupid laser pointers, using eye tracking to aim assist is really freaking cool if you want to feel like Legolas; using it to trigger moments in games when you're looking at the right place is genius, no more missing something cool in a cut-scene because you were looking elsewhere.\n\n**-- User Friction --**\n\nI like getting into the PSVR2 much more than getting into the Index.  With Index VERY often I end up not playing VR because I don't feel like taking the headset off the mount, putting on the controllers, (assuming the PC is on, otherwise that's another step) then launching SteamVR, waiting for the base stations to start spinning.\n\nWith PSVR2 I plug it into the PS5 (which eventually I might just leave it plugged in permanently), turn on the PS5, grab the controllers, but the headset on and I'm in.\n\n**-- Cinema Mode --**\n\nPSVR2's is better than Big Screen or SteamVR thanks to the higher resolution of the panel, I played Spider-Man and Horizon Forbidden West and they looked better than they do on my 1080p TV; I would love to watch movies on it.  The Mura is not nearly as distracting in this mode either.\n\n**-- Content and Games --**\n\n*Alyx vs. Aloy*\n\nThere's no reason to fight over this or pin them against each other, they are both excellent games that prove VR games can be unbelievable and compelling if the same effort and money is poured into them as it is for pancake games.\n\nHorizon Call of The Mountain is wonderful and for me it is reason enough to buy this thing.  I'm loving it.  I love shooting the bow, I love fighting the robot dinosaurs, it would have been more fun to have the combat be free range instead of just circling around but t's still fun.  The climbing is cool, the exploration is not monotonous, and the visuals are absolutely incredible.  The huge, open vistas in this game really make me wish I could play the other Horizon games in VR, even in just third person.\n\nGrand Turismo 7 is phenomenal in VR, I don't play racing sims, but this one blows my mind with how much fun it is, even with just a controller.  I think I'm going to have to buy a wheel now...it's so much freaking fun, and VERY immersive!\n\nResident Evil Village is awesome, I never played the pancake version but the VR version is cool as hell.  Full VR motion controls, manual reloading of the guns a la Pavlov, cool inventory mechanics, the graphics are insanely good and it looks really sharp.  I probably won't play a ton of it because I'm a coward, but it's an excellent experience if you're into Resident Evil games.  Second only to Call Of The Mountain and Alyx.\n\nNo Man's Sky is frustrating, the new mechanics are great in VR but it's a blurry mess.  I think if they implement good foveated rendering and are able to give us a much sharper sweet spot this could be a game changer.\n\nThe rest of the content is kind of the same thing we have in PCVR more or less.\n\n**-- Value --**\n\nPSVR is a lot of value for $550, Index is almost double that, but you also get a much more premium experience on it.  I think Valve needs to start cutting the price of the Index at this point, PSVR2 is definitely a better dollar per dollar value; basically PSVR2 is like a fully loaded Chevy Bolt, for all intents and purposes it's a very similar experience to a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or a Mustang Mach-E but spending the extra money fully enhances your enjoyment.\n\n**-- Final Thoughts --**\n\nI wouldn't get a PSVR2 over an Index, but I'm very happy and satisfied with it.  If you already have an Index, own a PS5, and $550 won't break the bank go for it.  I think it's a perfect companion to the Index.  I'm actually undecided if going forward I'm going to get new games for PSVR2 over Index (assuming release on both PC and PS5) because I find the friction of getting into VR much less on PSVR2.\n\nIf you have an Index but don't have $550 of disposable income for the PSVR2, stick with the Index, it's a better experience, you're only really missing out on Grand Turismo 7 and Horizon, there's plenty of similar options on PCVR for Grand Turismo and Horizon is not a MUST PLAY game even though it is a very good game.\n\nIf you have a PS5 but not a gaming PC it's also no contest, get the PSVR2, I don't think the difference is worth spending $3,000 on an Index + new PC.\n\nEDIT: I forgot about haptics.\n\nEDIT 2: The tracking issues were being caused by interference from my Index base stations.  Tracking is still not flawless like Index, but it's acceptable now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":84020,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PSVR2 vs. Index (TL;DR: Index is overall better, but PSVR2 is also great and an excellent Index \"companion\")","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/11awsj3\/psvr2_vs_index_tldr_index_is_overall_better_but\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"elvissteinjr","author_created_utc":1476536056,"author_flair_background_color":"#0079d3","author_flair_css_class":"edit-include-name","author_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Desktop+ Overlay Developer"}],"author_flair_template_id":"17d7dbce-6db8-11e9-99ec-0ea196723d6e","author_flair_text":"Desktop+ Overlay Developer","author_flair_text_color":"light","author_flair_type":"richtext","author_fullname":"t2_124yim","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1675612918,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10ufwm6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Developer)"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d046496e-81d3-11e9-a922-0e20483cc8ba","link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer)","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10ufwm6","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10ufwm6\/desktop_newui_preview_10_now_available\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678339520,"score":19,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Greetings. I initially didn't plan to make any posts for the in-dev NewUI branch releases, but it's been quite a while (November 2021 I think?) and the big 3.0 release is still a bit further out. Desktop viewing tools are all the rage again too it seems, so I thought it might be a good idea to write about what I've been up to lately.\n\nAs you or may not know, Desktop+ is a free and open-source desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.  \nTo get it right out of the way, if you have no issues with SteamVR's built-in desktop or have one of the commercial offerings, there's probably not much in it for you. Can't offer detailed comparisons since I'm not a user of those other applications, though.\n\nThe NewUI branch of Desktop+ is an effort to offer a more user-friendly interface with additional features stacked on top. New additions pretty much only go here unless they're very trivial to backport to the stable branch. I've been releasing preview builds every now and then since I started working in this.  \nAside from a new coat of paint, it also adds the following:\n\n- Floating settings windows (can be moved anywhere and pinned to use outside of dashboard)\n- Translation support (currently ships with English &amp; German)\n- Fully custom keyboard (layouts are user-definable, currently ships with US-QWERTY &amp; German QWERTZ, also improved input simulation)\n- Custom laser pointer (non-blocking input outside of dashboard, multi-laser input on keyboard)\n- Overlay Bar (better overlay management)\n- Window listing\/management improvements (window state tracking, auto-hiding\/restoration)\n- Better overlay creation (directly select source, drag window out of desktop overlay, get active window from Floating UI)\n- Auto-docking\n- Better Floating UI design (works with any curvature setting)\n- Capture FPS display\n- CEF-based web browser overlays (requires separate [Desktop+ browser component](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlusBrowser\/releases) installed or to be on \"NewUI Preview + Browser\" branch on Steam)\n- Keyboard auto-visibility (appears automatically when focusing a text input field)\n- Customizable drag behavior (force upright orientation\/fixed distance\/snap position)\n- HMD Floor Position origin can optionally spin with user\n- Application profiles (automatically switch overlay profile from SteamVR app launch, trigger actions on start\/exit)\n- Overlay position locking\n- ...and more, probably\n\nIf you're interested in the long version of this, you can start your journey with the [NewUI Preview 1 Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460?emclan=103582791468837125&amp;emgid=2984183718087120350) and work your way up from there. Most posts come with pretty video clips too, so there's those if you don't like reading.  \nOnly a handful of features are still missing compared to the old stable branch at this point, so my general recommendation would be to use the NewUI branch if you're not relying on those.\n\nWith the NewUI branch introduction out of the way, here's what's new in NewUI Preview 10 (compared to 9):\n\n**New:**\n\n- Added application profiles\n- Added overlay position locking\n- Added workarounds for invalid SteamVR dashboard state on launch\n- Floating UI now displays the overlay name when the output is invalid (i.e. window capture lost)\n- \"Focus Window when Pointing at Overlay\" and \"Focus Game when Laser Pointer leaves Overlay\" are now applied to the VR keyboard as well if the focused overlay is a window overlay\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Performance Monitor now caps most performance values to their maximum &amp; ignores very small decimals for average FPS display\n- Floating UI no longer uses fixed sizing for primary dashboard overlay fallback if isn't positioned close to the dashboard\n- Reverted Desktop+ laser pointer workaround from New UI Preview 9 (underlying issue was fixed with SteamVR Beta 1.25.3)\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fixed total desktop cropping size not being set in desktop mode\n- Fixed browser navigation state not being restored after restarting UI process\n- Fixed \"To HMD\" button being offset for dashboard origin overlays\n- Fixed Floating UI initially being position incorrectly after the capture was lost on a window overlay\n- Various other minor UI fixes and adjustments\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/3649639958566433176).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nDesktop+ is a free and open-source project I'm working on in my spare time. If you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).\n\nThat's it I think. I'm still working on the thing and not all that much is happening in the PCVR space... so business as usual.  \nLet me know if you have any questions or run into trouble.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":84022,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desktop+ NewUI Preview 10 now available","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10ufwm6\/desktop_newui_preview_10_now_available\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Realm_Walker12607","author_created_utc":1579073913,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_361vhdra","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1674889833,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"10n8xo5","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_10n8xo5","no_follow":true,"num_comments":2,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10n8xo5\/recent_low_fps_windex_part_2\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"L7wK1Kl49KxPZD0M1GZcCl9N9b2WLzXa9skOO1MB0Ds","resolutions":[{"height":50,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/B7ypeyQJP9pKae04yBd2a7407GO_srKy1hukseHm85c.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c514625a73965db7745a361dc1867c2707a253b2","width":108},{"height":100,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/B7ypeyQJP9pKae04yBd2a7407GO_srKy1hukseHm85c.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0ca5bd4bd15eeb3fcf1e14020244f4ffae67867e","width":216},{"height":149,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/B7ypeyQJP9pKae04yBd2a7407GO_srKy1hukseHm85c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ac21d35def15af2b01575ced34e73b0102625cf","width":320}],"source":{"height":215,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/B7ypeyQJP9pKae04yBd2a7407GO_srKy1hukseHm85c.jpg?auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0cef15d255170ab0d283f79ec4a9d794c9e0584b","width":460},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676227232,"score":7,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Previous Post Regarding topic: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10j5ycd\/recent\\_low\\_fps\\_w\\_index\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10j5ycd\/recent_low_fps_w_index\/)\n\nHello, it's me again. Back with an update after some \"testing\".   \n\n\nQuick summary for those who have not seen my previous post. I have an Alienware laptop that I've had for a couple of years, with an Index set about the same age. Was away for a few months and I came back to the Index running sub-optimal after a short period of time. I've played Tarkov, Ready or Not, Boneworks, H3VR, etc, usually at medium settings or below. So while vr performance dropped, other non-vr games ran the same with no real performance drop. Further details of context is linked above.   \n\n\nPrevious theory: All VR games received updates to the point it chokes the PC, potential GPU update is spaghetti code for VR, or there is some form of thermal throttling going on.  \n\n\nNew theory: There is GPU throttling, but based on usage, not thermals.   \n\n\nYes, while my laptop does get toasty, it runs 60C on idle and 70-80C while in VR (Based on task manager performance). For instance, when I decided to pick up Beat-Saber again, it runs smooth as butter for about 2-10 minutes (While in a song and not idle), but has the same fps drop. Only this time I noticed a pattern. I don't know whats causing this as only SteamVR and Beatsaber are running (No discord, or Spotify, absolutely nothing necessary), but after a short while, the GPU usage hikes to 100% then averages out to sub 50%. Again, this is with the thermals above. Then, 1 of 2 things happens. Either Pink and Red bars dominate the performance bar (Shown by SteamVR), or it progressively goes from red, to yellow, to green bars, and repeats from red (in short consistent bursts).  \n\n\nFound a similar instance on Steam forums (Not 1 to 1, but makes me think it has to do something with SteamVR): [https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/250820\/discussions\/0\/1626286205689770337\/?l=koreana](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/250820\/discussions\/0\/1626286205689770337\/?l=koreana)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am planning on stopping by Canada Computers to see if there is something that can be done in person.

And it is NOT just on loading screens, but pretty much in every game I play. Godrays smear text from the center of my screen, out to the end of my FOV.

Not going into the details of why, but my living situation had me constantly living in 2 or more separate locations every week, so a desktop replacement was more desirable for mobility.   \nAnyways, the setup I have was working perfectly fine. No high graphic settings for some of the games, but runs smoothly on usually medium settings. FYI, I religiously play H3VR, and once upon a time Beatsaber, Boneworks, and other miscellaneous games with discord running in the background\/Spotify. My specs are noted below for context.\n\nSpecs:  \nGPU: Geforce RTX 3070 Laptop  \nCPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10870H 2.20GHz (however usually runs at sub 4.00GHz)  \nRAM: 16GB  \nNote: Graphic settings are up to date, Windows 10 is up to date, set cooling to the max, and over 300GB of space left on SSD so shouldn't be storage issues.  Also, I ensured no background apps were running apart from the essential\/needed ones, and no smart graphical optimization(or game overlay from GeForce) was on for Nvidia or Windows.  \n\n\nThis is where the headscratcher begins. I had a VR Hiatus for 4 months prior to Christmas as I was out of the country. A few days after new years, I put on H3VR and have constant low fps. At first, I thought recent updates had caused the game to become harder to run. So lower the game settings to the minimum and still have the same issue, and sometimes felt even worse. I am not one for motion sickness, but it was bad and made the game unpleasant to play. Re-seated display cable, along with all necessary ports, and ensured all devices were up to date. Changed Index settings from 120hz (my usual) to 90hz with the same result (reset it to default as that is what was running before).At some point SteamVR has a popup for graphical sync issues and prompted a restart, same results.    \nA few weeks later of trying different settings and I have gotten nowhere. To top it off, when you maximize chrome or any other window (apart from the game\/steam\/discord) stuttering is greatly reduced, but still struggles to run at times. Usually, the opposite case was true when the game was maximized\/focused.   \n\n\nAny ideas for potential

I've seen people here posting their equipment problems and the community was giving profound suggestions, so I decided to give it a try, thank you in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Problem:**\n\nThe B button and menu button don't detect pressing, but touching is detectable, tested in SteamVR home's controller test.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Context:**\n\n* I've been using valve index kit on and off for 3 years, so it's out of warranty. Before I pick up the kit yesterday, there was a 6 months hiatus of me playing VR. \n* Considering the other controller is working perfectly fine, it's a bit too overkill to buy a new pair of controllers since you can only buy controllers in pairs, so my best hope is that the button malfunction is a trivial problem to fix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**My effort:**\n\n1. Due to the malfunction of the menu button, I can't even power on the right controller, I manage to power on the right controller with the USB cable, and with that, I leave the controller charged for like 12 hours with no result, so I can safely confirm that it is not a battery problem that caused it.\n2. I'm looking forward to a possibility that enables me to power on the controller persistently by sending machine commands using USB, right now the controller power off when you unplug the cable, and playing with the cable plug in is detrimental according to the steam official help page. While this solution doesn't resolve the B button problem, I can configure the input config so that I can just touch the B button to reload in Half-Life Alyx for example. I'm currently learning about OpenVR but I think this is gonna be in vain.\n3. Another intuitive method is opening up the controller, maybe replacing the button with a new one, which is actually a very daunting task for me since I don't have any related experience, and I found few guides on this topic. Currently, I only found a guide on ifixit website which is about replacing the strap, and I don't think I'll get value from that guide.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt will be a great help if you can leave your thought here, thank you!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":83697,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My right controller's B button and menu button are malfunctinal, I can't even power on my controller.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.6,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/108fbcp\/my_right_controllers_b_button_and_menu_button_are\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"yamashii","author_created_utc":1404854671,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_hbagk","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1673363970,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"108cbqh","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_108cbqh","no_follow":false,"num_comments":11,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/108cbqh\/liquid_between_my_lenses_out_of_warranty_looking\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676243149,"score":11,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"For context: I had been having issues where the adhesive gaskets were separating from rubber that covers the edges of the lens.

Initially, that seemed to resolve the issue. I'm guessing now that with the adhesive gone, however, somehow maybe sweat got into the lenses however because now I have a drastically reduced sweet spot by which the image looks clear and a couple of the Fresnel lens \"steps\" look filled in.

guys!\n\nI did a bit of research and found a couple of similar posts, tried suggested fixes but it seems to me that before attempting anything else I should figure out if perchance the way my games look\/they way I see them in Index is actually how it's supposed to look like.\n\nEssentially If I pick up an item and bring it up to my face, it's all blurry. If there's small font printed on some items and I try to bring myself closer or pick those items up to try and read that - it's impossible - way too blurry.\n\nAt the same time whenever I take a screenshot of such an item and then go and check it in my screenshot library - it's actually clear and readable.\n\nI had the Index kit for 2 days. All settings are default out of the box except for the refresh rate that I've set to 144hz.\n\nI've attached an example of a cookie box from HL: Alyx. Added some blur with photoshop to try to replicate what it looks like to me in game. Letters in the top were the only \"readable\" thing on the box when looking at it in VR. On the actual screenshot it's way more crisp.\n\nSame thing when looking at pistol's slide, for example. Not to that degree but printed make and model of the gun are really hard to read up close. In fact moving the gun further away (not as far away as arm's length but kinda at elbow length) makes for a far more crisp and clear picture.\n\nAnother example: in Pavlov, if I bring my gloves up to my face they get blurry. A bit further away and they look way better and sharper.\n\nI also noticed that there's a bit of a \"ghosting\" or \"smudging\" at the edges of the lenses. Especially noticeable with white text.

It has the potential to be an incredibly useful device that goes way beyond gaming.  Imagine being able to use VR and really look everywhere and have perfect real-life resolution, no matter where you look--no pixels--just images as sharp as you vision is.

Less great however is the time when it breaks. And it breaks a lot.\n\nThe headset's cable gave away \\~4 months into using the headset, and I do not use it that often. I got it replaced of course, but this is where my main complaints begin, I will get back to this.\n\nThe second time my stuff broke was for the controllers, the fragile joysticks specifically. **If users are constantly telling each other to not use a functionality of the controllers cause of how fragile it is, then it is simply not a good feature or should be improved.**\n\nNow, back to the replacements. The first headset replacement took me **2 months**. Most of that time did not have anything to do with Valve though so I do not hold that against them. But that's there just to give you some context.\n\nThe advanced controller replacements however have been far less stellar. I am currently on my **4th** attempt of getting them replaced. (Advanced replacement - the user gets to keep their original hardware and send it back at their convenience and new hardware will be shipped out before Valve receives the originals, within a predetermined timeframe before the user has to pay for the hardware.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempt 1:**\n\nValve sent out two boxes while only informing me of one arriving. I assumed they were both in one box cause of course I did, I logically assumed that they'd want to save on shipping costs. I was wrong. Luckily I still had my old controllers which were still somewhat functional so no big deal. I now had two right handed controllers though including my original one.\n\n*All I had to do was wait for them to send out a single left handed controller. Can't be hard, right?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempt 2:**\n\nAt this point I had to send back my original controllers as the shipping label was going to expire. I sent them back before I got my new ones as I assumed that the one box they informed me of again was going to have the left controller in it, ***no way that it'd be messed up again.***\n\n**...**\n\nNow a proud owner of two right handed controllers, I contacted support again. After waiting 4-5 days for a response on average, they informed me that they did in fact ship out two boxes. Great! I can finally get my left controller and all is well.\n\nUnfortunately due to the amount of time needed to get replies, **the post office had already returned the left controller by the time I learned that they sent it out.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempt 3:**\n\nThey sent out a single package, to my knowing as that's what support told me, and it did not even arrive in my country due to them messing up the shipping details and shipping it to my old address, which was in another country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Attempt 4 - Current:**\n\nThey have informed me of two packages this time via email. Package #1 has arrived in my country but has not been handed over to my national postal service for some reason.\n\nPackage #2 has been stored in it's apparent \"final\" parcel center, which funnily enough is next to my old address in another country. Your guess is as good as mine why the package stopped at the exact same spot as the last one in attempt 3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**This has been going on for 2 months.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion and final review:**\n\nTo repeat the point, the headset itself is fine. The controllers are nothing special to me as the finger tracking is mediocre and it deteriorates as time goes on.\n\nHowever the far more pressing issue is how fragile this whole setup is. These things are ridiculously fragile - to the point that a person might spend as much time waiting for replacements as actually using the headset in the allocated warranty time, which is a year.\n\nIn conclusion, I will not be recommending the Index to anyone, without some **heavy** disclaimers and fine print attached. Looking back at my experience I do not think I'm harsh in my judgement.\n\nThe price tag is \\~1000 euros. Around where I live people have to work **two jobs for a month straight to even slightly earn that money.** And working all that time for this? No. Just no. **Your money is better spent elsewhere.**","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":80815,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My in-depth experience with the Index - not exactly stellar.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.48,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/xasu0y\/my_indepth_experience_with_the_index_not_exactly\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"ciege92","author_created_utc":1402486242,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_gxrbd","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1662636793,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"x8y3c6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_x8y3c6","no_follow":false,"num_comments":15,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/x8y3c6\/i_just_got_my_index_games_look_fine_text\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1665455644,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":80816,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"I just got my index.

I tried to Google something similar but can't seem to find anything along these lines. I'm sorry for the long post, but I'm just so confused and want to give every detail in case...\n\nFor context, when I first got my Index a few days ago, my left controller *thought* it was paired but wasn't. Turns out that was a common error, so I followed the instructions given on Reddit (essentially using the Lighthouse console to unpair and then pair again), pairing the problem (left) first, and everything was fine. No problems (at least related to this) after that.\n\nToday, while playing Half-Life: Alyx, my right controller randomly stopped tracking properly. I didn't bang it against anything, I didn't step outside the play area, crouch, jump\u2014nothing. It just happened. My right hand in the game was buried in the floor, motionless. Okay, I thought, I must have run out of battery or maybe just need to restart the controller. But I took my headset off and found that both controllers still had a green light as if everything was fine, which I thought was... odd. But I thought nothing of it and rebooted anyway. This changed absolutely nothing, and the green light came right back. So I figured I just had to restart SteamVR.\n\nWell, I did, and it didn't fix anything, and now things were looking a little bizarre\u2014my right controller wasn't lit up on the little SteamVR app window (on desktop I mean) as if it wasn't connected, despite it having a green light in real life. When I hovered over the icon, it gave an option to pair controllers (as it does when the one you are hovering over is unpaired). But when I clicked \"pair controller,\" it showed me the \"Hmm, looks like you're all paired\" screen, saying if I wanted to pair another controller I'd have to turn one off. I tried turning the right off and back on. No change.\n\nSo this is where things get really weird. I tried the Lighthouse \"unpairall\" command from earlier, and this unpaired both, and this time, I repaired starting with the right one. It paired correctly. Everything was fine. Then, upon trying to pair the left one, the icon of which was unlit (again, indicating it isn't paired), it told me exactly the same thing: All your controllers are already paired. Turn one off.\n\nHence my post title. My SteamVR seems to have one \"phantom\" controller that just will not unpair, which is convincing it that it cannot accept both controllers at once because that would be one too many.\n\nAfter restarting SteamVR AGAIN, both controllers are connected, green lights, but only the right icon on desktop is lit, and only that controller is showing up in-game at *all* (to clarify\/remind, when my right hand initially went out, it just got stuck in the floor and didn't move rather than fully disappearing). And even weirder: Now, it actually *is* letting me access the \"pair controller\" screen from the left controller, but when I hold down the buttons to pair, it makes the little beep like it did, but nothing changes on desktop. Green light all throughout, but no real change system-side.\n\nAnnnnd after restarting SteamVR again, left connected properly, and right is now disconnected according to the real world (blue light) but connected according to SteamVR, which claims that the controller is just in \"standby\" and if I only move it, it'll wake up. Well... that isn't working lol. In game, it is now THERE, but it is again stuck in the floor (which leads me to believe this was the problem the first time this happened today, never unpairing but getting stuck in \"standby...\" whatever that means...)\n\nI'm sorry this is so confusing, but it seems entirely all over the place and it's hard to even nail down one issue as it's different every time I boot up, it seems. I know I'll probably just have to go to Steam Support, but I've heard mixed reviews so I just wanted to check here first and see if anyone had any thoughts...

I've had an OG Vive for a few years now and I've finally decided it is time for an upgrade. I'm tired of looking through a screen door and feeling like I'm looking through a pair of binoculars. I've been playing a lot of Skyrim VR along with a handful of other SteamVR games. I would also like to use my VR headset as a part-time monitor replacement, so I figure it's time for something more recent since it's just too uncomfortable for me right now with how hard it is to read text on the OG Vive. \n\nI almost pulled the trigger on an Index, but I hesitated after looking more into other options such as the Reverb G2 and the Vive Pro 2. While I've heard a lot of good things about the FOV of the Index and the knuckles controllers, reading about the higher resolution of more recent headsets makes me think that one of those might be a better option. If I were to go with something other than the Index, I'm definitely leaning more towards the Reverb. My concern with that however is the FOV, edge-to-edge clarity, and the controllers\/tracking.\n\nMy question is, how much of an upgrade is the Index from the OG Vive as far as screen door effect and clarity? For those with experience with Reverb\/VP2, is the perceived FOV comparable to the OG Vive, or better? \n\nJust to note, I have completely ruled out the Quest 2 given all of the data collection stuff.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79083,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Concern About the Index's Display","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.76,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vdw73y\/concern_about_the_indexs_display\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Blackgaze","author_created_utc":1428276689,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_mq5ci","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1655230601,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":1655402465.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vc9u14","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Impressions\/Review"}],"link_flair_template_id":"35fbd75e-33a6-11ea-9a52-0e4ad9ac2da5","link_flair_text":"Impressions\/Review","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vc9u14","no_follow":false,"num_comments":29,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vc9u14\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"g-F9VA4F0RK1HAbt6PZn3LSQc7aPCeIpo72AEMtBoHU","resolutions":[{"height":61,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/W_5ex1wEBVrCs6BYm2wMGpP0ok5GkAl7bP9nSrvY8Sc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c75761bf0702e5d5ce7be69ae302da19765c7d4","width":108},{"height":123,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/W_5ex1wEBVrCs6BYm2wMGpP0ok5GkAl7bP9nSrvY8Sc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b14e30ca70d92cb99b328c544accfb29dbdedf03","width":216},{"height":183,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/W_5ex1wEBVrCs6BYm2wMGpP0ok5GkAl7bP9nSrvY8Sc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=edda7ca0b70b94e58e20472bd4790ebcaadf6e78","width":320}],"source":{"height":353,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/W_5ex1wEBVrCs6BYm2wMGpP0ok5GkAl7bP9nSrvY8Sc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1726e4de4902a650b7c396c4c2ba1a0acc7963d3","width":616},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657131012,"retrieved_utc":1657131012,"score":41,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Time again for more Steam Next Fest mini-reviews of every VR game listed.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese are my own personal review of the available demos and unless I tell you to definitely avoid it, I suggest checking them out for yourself and judge your own opinion if you find my comments too harsh, which I can be if the game is lazy and\/or insulting badly designed (even for a WIP demo) and might not have much to say if its that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games are rated 0-5, with 5 being amazing quality.  I understand these are not AAA quality games and as they are demos there be bugs and missing features, so they are rated depending on the potential on the idea (and bonus points for originality), how much effort is put into its graphics and gameplay and the content and easy access of the demo's features.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe games will be tested with a Valve Index and RTX 3080 GPU.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm very disappointed how many demos are unplayable this time, from broken controls to until to get even started.  If I had to guess, many of these would be made to work for the Quest 2, so the Index controls would not be as responsive, but this didn't affect nearly as much experiences as it did in the past compared to this time around.  There are a few more games needed to be added to the list (more keep being added as well) but they are currently downloading as the list was the biggest this time around, but sadly most disappointing (no 4.5+ or higher this time around).  Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.  This does not work correctly for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down Fast VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1956860\/Down_Fast_VR\/\n\nThis bicycle game keeps drifting me to the left-side, no button seems to work (and it's not my controllers).  I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.  I am unable to get started in this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRANDMA**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1727550\/GRANDMA\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?).  Not sure If I wanted to play this one anyway from that cover\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hyperstacks**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1046760\/Hyperstacks\/\n\nI can't get the dash to work with the Index Controllers (little mini-jumps) and can't complete the tutorial.  It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79084,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vc9u14\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"RandomZandom","author_created_utc":1652315370,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_l3c4km51","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1654705414,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"v7tjdx","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_v7tjdx","no_follow":true,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/v7tjdx\/need_help_with_blurriness\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657152811,"retrieved_utc":1657152811,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"There's a billion posts about this I'm sure but I might as well make myself a new case.\n\nSomeone's gotta know why this thing is so blurry, I've read every post and followed directions and it all leads to pretty much the exact same result every time - blurry.

Where the headset plugs into the trident connecter, its dodgy. Pins don't look damaged to my eye but something is***  **definitely** ***dodgy with it! I might just try and refund the headset and wait for something better to come out, instead of dealing with slow warranty claims as valve doesn't have local stocked parts here in australia. Leaving this post up to help anyone else suffering these issues!***\n\nSo i just dropped $1900 AUD at ebgames on an index. Came from a reverb G2 for tracking\/controllers and higher refresh. I'm not new to VR I've had a few headsets over the years dating back to CV1.\n\nAnyway to the issue at hand, I've been playing for 3 days absolutely no issues, taking good care of my new expensive toy.  At the end of todays session of beatsaber i put down the headset and down at the PC to relax, 5 minutes later i forget to close steamVR and turned off my pc. I instantly realised what i did and canceled the shut down.\n\nI then opened up steamVR, everything connected fine but my headset needed a firmware update which i thought was odd. So i proceeded with it. Once it was done i shut down steam VR correctly putting the stations to sleep etc.\n\nNext day i came to play and i couldn't get the headset to connect to steamVR. (ERROR 108) I've been googling ever since to see 10 or more solutions and none worked. Those included ( unplugging power, Changing usb ports, Unplugging all USB's first, Deleting all the index drivers, reinstalling steamvr, reseating HMD cable + many more).\n\nThe day goes by and I'm panicing. I start randomaly plugging it into different usb\/dp slots while steamvr is open and then my screen flashes and steam has found my headset!! However there is another firmware update?! So i did it successfully and  I proceed to play a game and its working perfectly as it should. I gently fiddled with the cable to make sure there is no loose\/broken wires causing a cut to signal, however i don't find any.\n\nNow with the current stock\/warranty situation here in australia its non existent. All repairs and rma's will be with valve internationally i'd imagine. I feel like its the either the cable's dodgy, but that doesn't explain why its fully working as of this second. My gut says it was the firmware update that came out of no where.\n\nI have got one option i could pursue and thats getting a full refund based on a defective product. (AUS consumer law) Sorry for the wall of text I'm just trying to see what i can find out and i wanted to be thorough as possible.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78116,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Brand new headset acting strange, any tips or ideas?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.83,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/ua89bp\/brand_new_headset_acting_strange_any_tips_or_ideas\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[{"award_sub_type":"GLOBAL","award_type":"global","awardings_required_to_grant_benefits":null,"coin_price":150,"coin_reward":0,"count":1,"days_of_drip_extension":null,"days_of_premium":null,"description":"Thank you stranger.

times were for dead pixels, and it has always been a pain in the \\*\\*\\*, because they would reply once a day\/ every 2 days, and always retarding the replacement, asking you nonsense questions,

cable has a short circuit, it doesn't get powered anymore (i just want to precise, i take good care of my index), and they asked my system reports from everywhere, they also advised me to replace my

and been really enjoying it, so on the 25th of march, I got some extra money in and finally bit the bullet and ordered an index. by the 31st, it had arrived at my door (UK, so it came over from the netherlands). To get it started I had to uninstall and re-installing Steam VR, otherwise Steam seemed desperate to have BOTH the Vive and the Index running simultaniously. Updating the firmware on everything (yup, brand new and EVERYTHING needed an update immediately) took longer than expected, mostly due to the base stations but at least i didnt have to plug them in. Once the initial setup was done, started up Alyx, and then didnt stop playing until the early hours of the morning when I realised I was at work in a couple of hours. I had played the entire evening and most of the night without so much as a single tracking fault.  \n\nThe difference between the Vive and the Index is night and day, text is clearer, peripheral vision adds so much atmosphere to games, and those speakers are just as good as you hear, it's hard to believe without actually wearing the index just how good it sounds. \n\nTldr: The index is a fantastic bit of kit, for me it arrived quickly, was up and running in less than an hour, and ran without a single hitch even for extended play.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78127,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Not always doom and gloom","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/tw4qaw\/not_always_doom_and_gloom\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Flimbo_In_Limbo","author_created_utc":1514696784,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_q8g2j7z","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1646536654,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"t7ps2g","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_t7ps2g","no_follow":false,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/t7ps2g\/is_their_any_fix_for_help_wanted_and_the_knuckle\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654081060,"retrieved_utc":1654081060,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/sqx8kr\/fnaf\\_help\\_wanted\\_controllers\\_are\\_horribly\/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/sqx8kr\/fnaf_help_wanted_controllers_are_horribly\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Found this on here but they got nothing","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78163,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is their any fix for help wanted and the knuckle controllers?

No amount of troubleshooting can seem to fix this issue. Any restarts of SteamVR(restart or exiting the current session) or the computer will immediately revert the issue to issue #1.  \n\n\nTroubleshooting steps already taken, any involving SteamVR occurred across SteamVR and SteamVR Beta:  \n\n\n1)Removing SteamVR USB device process, including full restart and device disconnect\/reconnect.  \n\n\n2)Trying multiple display ports and USB ports.  \n\n\n3)Disconnecting and reconnecting base stations.  \n\n\n4)Multiple power cycles and tether disconnects.  \n\n\n5)Uninstall and reinstall of SteamVR.  \n\n\n6)Up-to-date drivers and VR firmware.  \n\n\n7)Issue occurs across multiple computers.  \n\n\nHeadset is generally taken care of and has not seen any drops, dings, intentional or negligent damage, etc, although there are some more fitness-based games I play that cause me to sweat a decent amount.   \n\n\nThis is second headset this issue has occurred and i'm not quite sure what other safety\/care measures I can do on my end, as I generally follow the advice given on the Valve website and the manual.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78847,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Same Issue Occurred on Two Separate Headsets Months Apart","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.86,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/ro35cq\/same_issue_occurred_on_two_separate_headsets\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"CodgeDhallenger","author_created_utc":1550177381,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_37ysfboc","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1640184065,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"rm6kkb","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_rm6kkb","no_follow":true,"num_comments":9,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/rm6kkb\/unplayable_performance_on_alienware_laptop\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656061551,"retrieved_utc":1656061551,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"  \n\nFor months I have not been able to play any VR games and I simply cannot fix this.

It was quite an upgrade over the OG Oculus Quest that I had still enjoyed immensely. Shortly after getting the Quest, I bought a pair of prescription lenses from VR Optician. I noticed a big difference in clarity but suffered from significant distortion at the edges of the lens. I was under the impression that it was just the Quest, but then I got lenses for the Index and suffered the same thing. My prescription is somewhat heavy:  \nOD : +6.00  Cyl : -0.50  Axis : 174  \nOS : +6.75  Cyl : -1.25  Axis : 004  \nAs a result of the strength behind these lenses I ended up paying a nice chunk of change to get them. I went through periods of using the lenses and just going in half-blind before trying my glasses in it in a few months ago. The difference was eye-opening! Visual clarity, minimal distortion, almost full FOV, it was great! Until about a week ago when a family member also wanted to try it with his glasses, considering that fact I had suffered no issues at the point I didn't deem it a risk. He took the headset off and despite my monitoring of his usage, the headset had a nice scuff-like scratch cluster in the middle of the lens. Practically killed it. Even more frustrating was that after inspecting my glasses, the left side, in particular, has a bunch of micro-scratches on it. Presumably, these are from the headset as I take good care of my glasses having worn them for most of my life. After talking with Steam support they were able to arrange a replacement, and I'm waiting for them to evaluate it and send me another. In the meantime, I've been searching for an alternative to prescription lenses, or at the very least a brand that won't have issues with strong prescriptions like this. And something that will prevent similar problems from arising in the future. So my question is this:  \n  **Question** \\- Is there an option that:  \n1 - Is compatible with my strong prescription listed above,  \n2 - Is FOV Friendly, and  \n3 - Prevents further damage to headset and glasses?  \nI have seen people mention film-like protective covers for the likes of motocross and skiing goggles, but haven't found enough information to try something that I have to stick to my lenses. I would, however, prefer something along these lines as I can just use my glasses in them as prescription possibly changes as time goes on and I can maintain that quality that thus far only my glasses have provided. I am aware of plano lenses but fear FOV reduction.  \nThank you for reading through this and thanks in advance!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78852,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Lens Protection For Use With Glasses (Read In Entirety)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.5,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/rbk6rb\/lens_protection_for_use_with_glasses_read_in\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"RedEagle_MGN","author_created_utc":1474424434,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_11k30x","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1638636642,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"r8toyt","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_r8toyt","no_follow":false,"num_comments":6,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/r8toyt\/i_studied_the_metaverse_for_8_years_and_heres\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"qGVPwHXJ9JGyVOgrUOKF90uRPm7K6GJubw7JkMoqJSI","resolutions":[{"height":56,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1267f54fcce7cb3dbdff2b20d5d71e485efe47b","width":108},{"height":113,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c73423b12e8bc7a8f27556d8372d16100adbbb","width":216},{"height":167,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33e1535747f980165500cb6622515ed0bbe340ce","width":320},{"height":334,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ff293981072e3935e5700daa2931c4a4d9b5ff7","width":640},{"height":502,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58c8e2c248d24741792d13c89ed9478a04caddfd","width":960},{"height":565,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=23924c28fca6a4660981da3fa7578ae425e0e462","width":1080}],"source":{"height":628,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/8uxM2qpgjS-Mjxc_HEJdtCnm_J1NG6CENLc83bpFAL8.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=7c814475b00369f82c1cc80865accbc62e04ef79","width":1200},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656081028,"retrieved_utc":1656081028,"score":8,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"# Preface:\n\nThe Metaverse is a hypothetical version of the internet in which 3D avatars navigate a 3D space. Companies envision this world to be one where most people will live most of the most meaningful parts of their life in the future.\n\n# 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard\n\nAs Metaverse enthusiasts, it's important to remember that we are likely the top 0.1% of computer users. Most people are confused by technology, overwhelmed by options and worried if they push the wrong button they will destroy something.\n\nChrome added a copy and paste feature to the menu because [people couldn't discover](https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/technology\/only-one-in-10-know-what-ctrlf-does--here-are-shortcuts-you-should-know-20111130-1o69d.html) how to copy and paste.\n\nSince the Metaverse simulates the countless possibilities of physical life, the complexity of the user interface gets out of hand quickly.\n\nI remember testing out Second Life and accidentally taking off my pants and being unable to put them back on for 20 minutes.\n\nClearly, mouse and keyboard would not be a sufficient way of interacting with the metaverse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space\n\n18 years ago, Second Life came out and the hype around the Metaverse future was just as real back then as it is today. You can visit the empty government buildings, brand showcases and  cities to get a taste of the forgotten glory.\n\nTime and time again people have been put together in a virtual space, and we still went back to physical life for real connections.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves, why did we leave virtual worlds and go back to physical life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships\n\nThe great benefits of any relationship are usually found in the most challenging operations of cooperation, marriage is a great example. Dating is exciting but sharing a life with someone is deeply sacrificial and yet, the benefits of marriage are enormous.\n\nIn  digital worlds we scarcely invest as heavily in relationships as in physical life. When we can go anywhere, be with anyone it's easy to constantly look for greener grass.\n\nThis problem is accentuated by the ability to change your name\/avatar at will. When people can burn others and simply change their identity to escape consequences, they do. Investing in a real reputation and a single identity is the first step to solving this issue.\n\n# \n\n# 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world\n\nIn digital worlds, we find ourselves mixed in with people from different cultures who have different values and interests. By contrast, in physical life we are naturally segmented with people who are more likely to share our values and ideas.\n\nGaming has the power to break ice between people and therefore has intrinsic utility to the Metaverse.\n\nBy using gamification we can organize and connect people of similar interests and values in a virtual space.\n\nNot only that, gaming has the power to get people to relax. Human beings don\u2019t develop meaningful friendships when forced into it. This is what social games and \u201cvirtual life\u201d games often get wrong. Actual gameplay builds the context we need to relax and have a conversation to find people we are compatible with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior\n\nIf you've ever lifted a baby and smiled at it, you know that facial expressions are deeply embedded in how we communicate. When we hurt someone's feelings, their facial expressions changes and, as we reciprocate their facial expressions, our body produces the same emotions as we make that individual feel. This acts as a natural tempering of our behaviour that we don't get when we communicate over the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world\n\nA long time ago, there was a single company that dominated the telephone market. To call anybody who was the customer of the company you needed to have a phone that was with that same company, phones were not interoperable. Today, if you want to contact somebody on Facebook, you need Facebook to do so. This is how social networks defend their intellectual property.\n\nMeta executive Jason Rubin:\n\n\u201cThe first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,\u201d Rubin wrote. \u201cWe must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.\u201d - [CNBC](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/10\/30\/facebooks-meta-mission-was-laid-out-in-a-2018-paper-on-the-metaverse.html)\n\nThe network effect is a scary prospect because it means that there will likely be only one Metaverse to rule them all in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. Customization is the enemy of usability\n\nIt's fascinating to bump into so many people who share the idea that no corporation should control the future of human interaction. However, it's laughable that we're using the same ill-advised ideas that allowed Facebook, Google and apps to dominate when it comes to this next chapter.\n\nOne of the reasons that Facebook overtook MySpace was that MySpace allowed people to customize their profile infinitely. This led to a myriad of different user interfaces, confusing navigation and a poor user experience.\n\nJust imagine a myriad of virtual worlds all with their own user interface, controls and standards. The experience of travelling from world to world would be like being born all over again and having to learn how to read and write.\n\nTherefore, the virtual world must have a single user experience to reach mass adoption.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare\n\nAs the network effect brings everyone to a single Metaverse, the potential for the abuse of power will be astronomical. The Metaverse will understand where you are, who you are with and even what you look at.\n\nAI will be able to process that data to better understand you than you yourself and data is the first step toward oppression.\n\nUtilizing all this data, powerful individuals will have the ability to suppress dissent, identify people of contrarian opinion etc.\n\nMoreover, if we begin to fool ourselves that we can agree on morals and values, those who [disagree with the mainstream](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tyranny_of_the_majority) will live in constant fear of losing their friends, job and opportunities if they are banned from the Metaverse.\n\nP.S.

Now I also would like to know why did this happen, what I\u2019m guessing is that maybe it was because the first 2 times I tried to pay for the index my bank rejected the purchase\/payment because of security protocol and then they called me asking if that was me making those payments and I told them that yeah it was me and then the third time the transaction went through with no problems and the payment was successful.

I am set on getting index controllers. I can get a set of base stations and index controllers for $999AUD online. I can get a Vive pro 2 HMD for $1300AUD from a local store. I can get an index hmd for $1250AUD from eBay in the country. I can get a index full kit for about $2200ish AUD off eBay from the states. I can get a Pimax 5k super for about $1700 with index controllers plus base stations or an 8kx for about $2300 with the same kit.\n\nWhat makes me hesitant on the pro 2 is that from what I\u2019m reading, the audio on both the speakers and the microphone especially are fairly bad. And since I will mostly be playing VR with friends I would like a good mic. Also the headband design looks to not allow for use of a standard headphone or headset. As someone who has a small collection of hifi headphones I would like to use them if applicable(mainly for sit down applications for better audio). Also hearing issues regarding 3d stereo effect causing eye strain for this particular model.\n\nThe index seems a great all rounder as it comes with a great microphone and audio solution, while the headband also seems to allow for headphones. Sweet spot is larger according to some, and it has great fov out of the box. Also the super easy software integration is very nice. But the panels are 2 years old and apparently show their age. Also warranty might be a bit sketchy due to ordering off of eBay.\n\nThe pimax kits seem enticing as they use Amazon for shipping so warranty would be viable although I have heard mixed thoughts on this. Super wide fov would be nice but also seems to be a downside as it can produce distortions if not setup perfectly which may take some time. I have heard tracking is not that great and that not all games are supported properly. Also heard a lot of shoddy qc from them also. If they work perfectly though then they seem really good, especially the 8kx. Headband doesn\u2019t seem to allow headphones and the mic seems okay but better than vp2.\n\nI currently have no VR setup and my system specs are 11600k\/3080ti 16gb 3200mhz c14 980 pro ssd.\n\nI have tried the quest 2 and I hated the fov and it didn\u2019t seem very clear with its limited ipd adjustment. Also the headband is terrible. Hating the fov has made me not consider the g2 also.\n\nSo yeah. Sorry for the wall of text but I just can\u2019t seem to come to a conclusion so I would LOVE some help in the situation from people with experience in the matter.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78860,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Undecided on a VR setup please help me decide.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.66,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/qpeaaz\/undecided_on_a_vr_setup_please_help_me_decide\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"001jigsaw","author_created_utc":1502392215,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_e3wtlv","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1634129032,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"q7achn","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_q7achn","no_follow":false,"num_comments":13,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/q7achn\/very_blurry_up_close_text_objects\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656127825,"retrieved_utc":1656127825,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey everyone,\n\nThe Index is my first VR headset. I've had it for a few months, and honestly, I gave up on it the first few weeks I had it. Now I'm trying again. My issue is that any up close text or objects are basically unreadable. Distant objects are pretty clear (I can accurately shoot things in the distance with handguns). Yes, I'm wearing my glasses inside the HMD, and my prescription is for seeing distance. I have no issues seeing up close outside of the headset (you know, reality).\n\nFirst, let me start off by saying that I have most definitely found the \"sweet spot\" in the headset. I have the vertical height adjusted to where it is noticeably the clearest. Additionally, I have my IPD set around what my eyeglass prescription says - it seems to be the most comfortable, and correct. Lastly, I have the lenses located at a distance from my eyes that seem comfortable. That should rule out any setup error.\n\nAs for the settings, I have the global settings set to 90hz and resolution\/ss to 100%.\n\nI just bought H3VR. I cannot read any of the text on the controller menus, or any of the screens at the firing range. Any games that have a scoped weapon, the scope is blurry and basically unusable. But the further away it gets from my \"face\" the clearer it gets. Problem is, there are tons of pop up menus and such that stay in a position where it is really blurry. If any game has something I need to read that isn't in HUGE letters, or is very far away, I am pretty much unable to play it. While holding a weapon in hand and looking down at it, all the fine close-up details are blurry.\n\nSteamVR home is decent. If I press the home button and bring up the menu, and open the settings screen, the text here is a little blurry but still readable. I tried playing DCS and Project Cars 2. I wasn't able to see any of the instruments\/gauges.\n\nOnto my GPU &amp; CPU, which I'm suspecting is the problem:\n\n* Radeon RX 580 8GB (I'm guessing this is where some of you are shaking your heads)\n* AMD Ryzen 7 2700x\n\nSo, from what I remember, my currents GPU is below minimum requirements. Everything except for things up close actually looks pretty good though. Why would the things up close be the only big issue? Pixel count?\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to see how many of you would agree that my GPU is the issue, or if it is something else. The last thing I want to do is sink more money into this setup if it's not going to make things readable. \n\nOn that note, any GPU recommendations?

Especially active on VRChat and I love Beat Saber and a few others, as well as just other purposes like exploring 3D modelling scenes I'm working on in 3D space.\n\nAnyway, a very close friend of mine who got me into VRC offered me up to $1k budget as a means of which to help me upgrade my setup. I told her I'd think about it for a while and after a few weeks or so, I decided I'm getting into this so much enough where I'd be using VR regularly enough now where it'd really be a good idea to finally upgrade. So I took her up on her offer and after seeing $1k now in my PayPal from her, along with a \"*enjoy the Index*\" message, I went right on over to Steam and got the full Index kit, along with paid a little out of my own budget to upgrade to full body - I got 3 Vive 2.0 trackers. The trackers &amp; straps for them just arrived today, and my Index gets here Friday. So, I figured I'd ask if anyone had any idea, what kinda quality leaps should I expect?

I've been experiencing this issue for a while, but recently it has gotten worse. At first I thought my controller was busted and actually purchased a new one. The new controller is experiencing the same issues. Then I thought it had to be a reflection, so I got like 6 blankets and covered EVERYTHING. Still issues. I finally was able to isolate it(I believe) to the Vive Lip Tracker. My controllers function completely normal when it's turned off, and one has drift issues if it's turned on. \n\nI'm using it with the Valve Index- which I realize is not officially supported. I've even plugged the Lip Tracker directly into my PC with a USB extender to test if somehow plugging it into the headset was an issue. Still problems. I  spoke to some else who uses to Vive Pro Eye and is having similar issues with the Lip Tracker...so that makes me think it's probably not incompatibility with the headset. \n\nI've tried a billion things to fix it and instead of more word vomit, I'll make a list.  \n\n\n1. Uninstall\/reinstall Steam VR.\n2. Unpair all USB devices through SteamVR menu and re-paired carefully\n3. Unpaired all USB devices via method discussed here [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/i89fqe\/weird\\_index\\_controller\\_tracking\\_drift\/g18inbv?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/i89fqe\/weird_index_controller_tracking_drift\/g18inbv?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n4. Unplugged all usb devices on my PC to just VR Headset, Keyboard, Mouse, Mic, and Lip Tracker\n5. Uninstalled Lip Tracker software and reinstalled\n6. Using only 2 lightboxes instead of 4\n7. Covering Lip Tracker IR light while on\n8. Experimenting with launching SteamVr with it plugged in or not \n9. Plugging headset into different USBs\n10. New controller.\n11. Covered everything with blankets incase it was reflections.\n\n\\*\\*Additional Note: It seems to happen mostly when my hand is down by my outer thigh and butt area.\n\nI received the Vive Lip Tracker in April 2021 and have been using it with LIV and several body trackers quite often. I  experienced occasional drifting issues during this time, but over the past couple weeks, it has gotten bad enough that I often can't pass a Beat Saber song due to a controller blasting off to the moon. All the testing I've been doing the last few days have been focused on making it work without additional trackers- only controllers and Lip Tracker.\n\nSpecs:\n\n Valve index \n\nCPU: Intel(R) Core\u2122 Processor i7-9700K \n\nRAM: 32GB DDR4\/3200MHz \n\nMOTHERBOARD: MSI MPG Z390 \n\nGPU: GeForce(R) RTX 2080 SUPER \n\nPCI card: 2x FebSmart FS-U4-Pro USB 3.0 \n\n4 Light Boxes mounted on wall in 4 corners of room\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Vive Lip Tracker makes one controller drift.

I'm a pretty new guy when it comes to the VR scene, so be nice to me lol  \n\n\nSo first things first, I bought a 3rd 2.0 base station, which from what I've read (and what makes sense) it's agreed that it'll help tracking issues\/occlusion.   \n\n\nThat being said, how should I orient all 3 of them? Should I try and mount them all 120^(o) apart from each other, or is adjusting the existing 2 and mounting the 3rd in an unused (but facing-me) corner going to be a better option?
