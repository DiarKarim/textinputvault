But I understand this is reddit and not everyone comes here to watch my YT videos.  So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.","author_fullname":"t2_a7mpw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Towers and Powers Review: VR's newest tower defense game.","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (YouTuber)"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18suqb5","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (YouTuber)","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703772486.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.ValveIndex","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM\"&gt;https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate it if you would give my video a watch, I give some pretty good examples in it to help give you an idea of what this game is like.

The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn&amp;#39;t help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you&amp;#39;re looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=3a0bd6a8095801405d5ed95ec208213cfb3518f3","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=246118633e6653f0db20e00beb06223b9cc3906e","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0508d4bc30738f86601aee90ddf6332c8ef1296","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Xa-5yCG40w1n6buQ0nOBzAYmhpIwg4VRvUP0RBAbJGw.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e6070b955d44fe81246bfebe72c5203d2e188e6","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"ufpSs57_l5cXn1luM5M6K0sTI67MB3qDxAF5TI26_6g"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"71d1d398-81d4-11e9-af4e-0e2cf56a4026","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","id":"18suqb5","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"bmack083","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/18suqb5\/towers_and_powers_review_vrs_newest_tower_defense\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/18suqb5\/towers_and_powers_review_vrs_newest_tower_defense\/","subreddit_subscribers":88717,"created_utc":1703772486.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","selftext":"Hello! I'm having an issue with my Index and after an entire day of troubleshooting I just cannot get it to work, so I wanted to consult the almighty Reddit for support.  \n\n\nSo, the issue, like the title says, is I'm getting one of two issues upon booting my headset. The first issue, which almost always happens first, is that SteamVR says my headset is on and tracking no problem, but when I put it on the display is off and the lights on the front of the headset are blue, not green. The other error, usually after trying to restart SteamVR from the prior issue, is Error 436, having trouble connecting to the GPU. I've spent the better part of the last 24 hours browsing through every possible Reddit post, support article, and Youtube video I could find trying literally anything and everything and I cannot get it to work.   \n\n\nThings I've tried:\n\n* Trying different USB ports (2.0, 3.1, 3.2)\n* Trying different display ports\n* Unplugging secondary monitor\n* Unplugging and replugging the cable going into the headset\n* Using a different breakout cable\n* Using a different Index (my brother has one)\n* Uninstalling and reinstalling SteamVR\n* Deleting all files related to SteamVR I could find in the Steam folder and in appdata\n* Reinstalling graphics drivers, current version and a version back when the headset was kind of working\n* Using USBDEView to uninstall USBs not active in the computer (with the headset unplugged ofc)\n* Using Developer Settings to uninstall all related USBs, unplugging the headset, restarting, starting SteamVR, and plugging the headset back in\n* Turning off and on Direct Mode\n* Setting display port compatibility to Type A\n* Trying USB ports on front of case\n* Changing USB power management settings\n* Changing USB Hub power management settings\n* Changing Nvidia power management settings\n* Unplugging ALL of my peripherals, leaving only the headset and my mouse connected\n* Probably more I forgot about and will update if I remember them\n\nMy Specs:\n\n* RTX 4090 GPU\n* AMD Ryzen 9 7900x\n* ASUS ROG B650E-F Motherboard (Wifi Adapter not attached currently)\n* Steam and SteamVR installed on SSD\n* 64GB of DDRM5 RAM\n* Two monitors, both connected to display port (GPU has 3 ports for DP)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy headset works fine on my brother's computer so I'm confident it's not an issue with the headset display or the breakout cable itself. I've seen posts about how it could be an issue with the USB hub on the motherboard itself, but I have a brand new motherboard, a B650E-F (wifi adapter not connected currently).\n\nThe headset has worked intermittently. Prior to it completely stopping display, it would sometimes turn out without the display only to come back after a restart, or it would turn on with a flicker, almost like recording a low refresh rate TV with a camcorder back in the day, but again a restart would fix it. As of yesterday though it completely quit functioning.\n\nOther odd behavior I've noticed is that after I get a 436 error, certain games will run incredibly poorly until I restart my entire PC, even if the headset is no longer plugged in. Final Fantasy XIV will run at 5fps after trying to use the headset and receiving the error, leading me to believe it could be graphics driver or card related, but it's a brand new 4090, only 3 months old, so that would really surprise me.\n\nThe last time I got it to display was a few hours ago, after completely reinstalling SteamVR and my graphics drivers, and freshly rebooting the PC (all of this for the fourth time), it launched to the default  room setup, which I did. The headset sent me to the default SteamVR home, and it was displaying fine. I used it for a bit then set it down, went to go back to try it again, and the issue had immediately returned. \n\nEvery time I launch SteamVR for the first time after a restart, my main monitor will go black, then my secondary monitor, then they will both return and certain applications will have crashed, such as Discord, while Steam restarts itself, further leading me to believe it is graphics driver related.\n\nMy current working theory is that the headset was damaged in a car accident I was in (rear-ended during a move across the country, with my headset in the back)  and it's damaged to the point where it is corrupting display drivers upon attempts to connect to the PC. I am not technically literate enough to know if that is something that is even possible, but I'm having my brother using my headset and cable for the foreseeable future to see if the issue pops up on his computer but it might take a few days, as it did for me for the issue to pop up.\n\nI have tried what I believe to be every fix I could possibly find online, short of buying a new USB hub, but given I had been connecting the headset almost no issues a week prior, with no changes in my peripherals or USBs between now and then, I find it highly unlikely that's the issue, though if someone with more technical know-how believes otherwise I'll shell out the money for one if necessary.\n\nAny help or suggestions would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end, just wanted to play some Blade and Sorcery last night and it turned into this mess.

I have an AMD 5700XT and a Ryzen 7 5700 CPU. I'd like to think that's good enough for playing VR chat with fullbody accessories. One thing I noticed is that when I'm playing the game and go to a busy lobby. It's like I'm getting flashbanged inside of my headset (grey flashes) sometimes even frame lag, motion sickness type stuff. I also have a performance chart up for when I play the game. Most of the time the chart is in the yellow, or hits red and sometimes purple. Also I go over the ghz which is like 11. This doesn't really happen when I'm with a couple of friends in a smaller world (I have great internet which is ethernet) I have a prebuilt cyberpower PC. I'm not super tech savvy but I'm learning.

I also have a performance chart up for when I play the game. Most of the time the chart is in the yellow, or hits red and sometimes purple. Also I go over the ghz which is like 11.

My main uses are gonna be for Simracing (Assetto Corsa), VRChat, and various other games (GORN, Half-Life: Alyx, Elite Dangerous, etc). I appreciate higher resolution but I believe the main selling point for me is going to be a higher refresh rate. Both my monitors run at 144Hz and I don't see myself wanting to have a headset with a refresh rate anything below that. But anyway, here are some pros and cons I can think of for the three types of headset I want:\n\n**Valve Index:**\n\n\\+ Cheapest to bundle with controllers and base stations  \n\\+ Includes Half-Life: Alyx  \n\\+ Best headphones and microphone  \n\\+ Good FOV  \n\\+ Passthrough cameras  \n\\+ Valve customer support\n\n\\- Oldest model  \n\\- No pancake lenses  \n\\- Lowest resolution  \n\\- Controller stick drift  \n\\- Heaviest\n\n**Bigscreen Beyond:**\n\n\\+ Best resolution  \n\\+ Most comfortable: fully custom IPD, face cushion, and prescription lens covers  \n\\+ Lightest  \n\\+ Best color definition  \n\\+ Pancake lenses\n\n\\- Lowest FOV  \n\\- Lowest refresh rate  \n\\- Most Expensive ($1,000 *without* controllers or base stations)  \n\\- No passthrough cameras  \n\\- Unsure if my PC can handle it\n\n**Pimax 5K Super (KDMAS):**\n\n\\+ Highest FOV  \n\\+ Highest refresh rate  \n\\+ Good resolution\n\n\\- Expensive to bundle with controllers and base stations  \n\\- Lackluster build quality and materials  \n\\- Unsure if my PC can handle it\n\nSo they all have their own unique features that all make them worthy of my money. The Index has passthrough cameras, the Beyond has pancake lenses, and the 5K Super has the widest FOV. As I said before, the right balance between good resolution \/ lenses and a high refresh rate is paramount in my decision. I hope you all can help me with my purchase, thanks!\n\n**EDIT 1:** Some people were asking for my PC specs, so here is what I have\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 5600X  \nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 (Gigabyte

figured I'd post this here for people who are curious or on the fence.\n\n**Background**: I've been an avid VR enthusiast since 2017 when I got an Oculus Rift, I've had an Index since release day.  I adore my Index, and I love playing VR games.\n\n***--*** ***Visuals --***\n\n*Screendoor:* A lot of people (including me, initially) are confusing screendoor with Mura, I don't think this headset has a particularly bad screen door effect, I hardly notice it at all.  What it does have, is very noticeable Mura (It looks like constant film grain, except it doesn't move) in games that are running at a lower than native resolution.  Index wins here, in terms of clarity, Index is better.\n\n*Sharpness:* This varies from game to game, GT7 is extremely sharp and beautiful; full immersion, nothing like it. Horizon Call of the Mountain is a bit blurry, No Man's Sky is a blurry mess, RE8 is pretty sharp.  My guess is that they're rendering the game at a low res and aggressive with antialiasing, it reminds me of how blurry Hitman 3 is on PCVR, because in GT7 and cinema mode there's zero blur, it's gorgeous, and sharp. PSVR2 takes the win here, text is much more readable, sharper, even the small tiny gauges and instruments in GT7 are perfectly readable without getting close or straining your eyes.\n\n*God Rays:* PSVR2 only has God Rays when you're looking at white text on a black screen, and even then they are minimal.  All the games I played have zero God Rays.  Big win for PSVR2 here.\n\n*FOV:* Index by a hair, I was very pleasantly surprised by the PSVR2's FOV, even without pushing the lenses all the way up to my face I was getting FOV comparable to Index; I never feel like I am wearing a scuba mask like in the old CV1 days.\n\n*Colors\/Blacks\/Brightness:* PSVR2 unfortunately has Mura, but the colors are gorgeous and vibrant, it has true blacks, and the brightness is perfect.  In cinema mode it looks better than my 1080p 65\" TV, I still love the Index, and I'm happy with the image quality, but if you do an A\/B comparison the PSVR2 takes the win on this one.  In the Index colors look a tiny big washed out in comparison.\n\n**-- Sweet Spot --**\n\nIndex has a larger sweet spot, at least easier to find.  PSVR has a good sweet spot but it's noticeably smaller and it requires readjusting the headset often if you lose it.  I hardly every have to adjust my Index once it's on.  Part of the problem is how you put it on and take it off.\n\n**-- Design and Finish --**\n\nNo contest, the Index is much better designed, you can set it and forget it once you've found your perfect comfort setting.  On the PSVR you have to use the ratchet and button combo to adjust it from scratch every time.  Putting it on is much more awkward, you also run the risk of accidentally changing the IPD because your finger touches the super sensitive IPD wheel.\n\nThe Index feels like a premium product, the PSVR2 uses cheap plastics and it feels like a toy, the slider for the screens feels super flimsy.\n\n**-- Comfort --**\n\nThis is a tie; I think the Index is maybe more comfortable overall; my issues with the PSVR2 when it comes to comfort might have to do with overtightening it so maybe long term I'll feel different.  I will say, long sessions, I barely felt the weight of the PSVR2 on my head, whereas the Index lets you know it's there after an hour.\n\n**-- Sound --**\n\nLet's get this out of the way, the Index has a premium, groundbreaking audio solution; the PSVR2 comes with two cheap earbuds.  The sound quality is fine (I'm not an audiophile), but every time I use it I miss not having to worry about sound because the Index speakers are right there by my ears ready to rock; with the PSVR I forget to put on my earbuds until after I'm already in a game lol\n\n**-- Controller --**\n\nKnuckles are still king, I missed not being able to fully open my hands. Not much else to say, but that's because the Knuckles are so much better it's not worth wasting time litigating this.\n\n**-- Tracking --**\n\nFlawless on Index, ~~worse than I expected on PSVR 2; when I draw arrows too fast in Horizon my hands go all over the place, even if I keep my head too still for too long the PSVR2 kind of freaks out and takes me out of the game because it says it can't track and to try again.  I've been taken out of every single game I've played so far because the headset stops tracking altogether, my hands are sometimes all over the place in some games (in Resident Evil it was impossible to aim the gun in several places because the hands were freaking out).~~\n\n~~I don't know why I'm having so many tracking issues, I have the light on in my room, it's not a huge room and my Index base stations are on standby (I'm going to try flat out unplugging them tonight...maybe that's what's messing with it)~~\n\nMy tracking issues seem to have been caused by my Index base stations (even on stand-by) I unplugged them as well as the Index itself and the tracking on PSVR is MUCH better.  It's not flawless like Index, but it's far better than it was before.  I still have issues when the controllers are somewhat occluded, and it has a hard time sometimes just tracking the room space, but it's perfectly acceptable now.\n\n**-- Haptics --**\n\nI completely forgot to mention this because frankly it's kind of forgettable.  Edge goes to PSVR2 because having haptics on the headset is actually quite cool, in certain situations it enhances the gameplay; for the most part, I forget they're there and doesn't really do much.\n\nI personally feel the haptics on the Sense controllers are overhyped, they don't feel any different than the Knuckles to me; the Knuckles have excellent haptics.\n\nFor the triggers, the adaptive triggers are nice and I do notice them in certain gameplay moments, I like it, I never liked them on the Dual Sense and I turned me off almost immediately but I do think they add immersion to VR, it's just not something that I think is any sort of game changer.  The Index already has two-stage triggers that I feel get the job done just as well, but yes, the adaptive part definitely edges out the Knuckles here as well.  Frankly none of this is relevant because the tracking is so bad it takes away from all these icing on the cake type features.\n\n**-- Unique Features --**\n\nPSVR2 takes the win here.  The passthru cameras are awesome, it's trippy to see my surroundings in the headset with very good depth perception.  It's also super helpful.  Eye tracking is a bit of an underrated killer feature, I think, foveated rendering is fantastic to keep performance high and the games looking gorgeous, eye tracking in menus is a genius feature I hope every developer embraces, no more stupid laser pointers, using eye tracking to aim assist is really freaking cool if you want to feel like Legolas; using it to trigger moments in games when you're looking at the right place is genius, no more missing something cool in a cut-scene because you were looking elsewhere.\n\n**-- User Friction --**\n\nI like getting into the PSVR2 much more than getting into the Index.  With Index VERY often I end up not playing VR because I don't feel like taking the headset off the mount, putting on the controllers, (assuming the PC is on, otherwise that's another step) then launching SteamVR, waiting for the base stations to start spinning.\n\nWith PSVR2 I plug it into the PS5 (which eventually I might just leave it plugged in permanently), turn on the PS5, grab the controllers, but the headset on and I'm in.\n\n**-- Cinema Mode --**\n\nPSVR2's is better than Big Screen or SteamVR thanks to the higher resolution of the panel, I played Spider-Man and Horizon Forbidden West and they looked better than they do on my 1080p TV; I would love to watch movies on it.  The Mura is not nearly as distracting in this mode either.\n\n**-- Content and Games --**\n\n*Alyx vs. Aloy*\n\nThere's no reason to fight over this or pin them against each other, they are both excellent games that prove VR games can be unbelievable and compelling if the same effort and money is poured into them as it is for pancake games.\n\nHorizon Call of The Mountain is wonderful and for me it is reason enough to buy this thing.  I'm loving it.  I love shooting the bow, I love fighting the robot dinosaurs, it would have been more fun to have the combat be free range instead of just circling around but t's still fun.  The climbing is cool, the exploration is not monotonous, and the visuals are absolutely incredible.  The huge, open vistas in this game really make me wish I could play the other Horizon games in VR, even in just third person.\n\nGrand Turismo 7 is phenomenal in VR, I don't play racing sims, but this one blows my mind with how much fun it is, even with just a controller.  I think I'm going to have to buy a wheel now...it's so much freaking fun, and VERY immersive!\n\nResident Evil Village is awesome, I never played the pancake version but the VR version is cool as hell.  Full VR motion controls, manual reloading of the guns a la Pavlov, cool inventory mechanics, the graphics are insanely good and it looks really sharp.  I probably won't play a ton of it because I'm a coward, but it's an excellent experience if you're into Resident Evil games.  Second only to Call Of The Mountain and Alyx.\n\nNo Man's Sky is frustrating, the new mechanics are great in VR but it's a blurry mess.  I think if they implement good foveated rendering and are able to give us a much sharper sweet spot this could be a game changer.\n\nThe rest of the content is kind of the same thing we have in PCVR more or less.\n\n**-- Value --**\n\nPSVR is a lot of value for $550, Index is almost double that, but you also get a much more premium experience on it.  I think Valve needs to start cutting the price of the Index at this point, PSVR2 is definitely a better dollar per dollar value; basically PSVR2 is like a fully loaded Chevy Bolt, for all intents and purposes it's a very similar experience to a Hyundai Ioniq 5 or a Mustang Mach-E but spending the extra money fully enhances your enjoyment.\n\n**-- Final Thoughts --**\n\nI wouldn't get a PSVR2 over an Index, but I'm very happy and satisfied with it.  If you already have an Index, own a PS5, and $550 won't break the bank go for it.  I think it's a perfect companion to the Index.  I'm actually undecided if going forward I'm going to get new games for PSVR2 over Index (assuming release on both PC and PS5) because I find the friction of getting into VR much less on PSVR2.\n\nIf you have an Index but don't have $550 of disposable income for the PSVR2, stick with the Index, it's a better experience, you're only really missing out on Grand Turismo 7 and Horizon, there's plenty of similar options on PCVR for Grand Turismo and Horizon is not a MUST PLAY game even though it is a very good game.\n\nIf you have a PS5 but not a gaming PC it's also no contest, get the PSVR2, I don't think the difference is worth spending $3,000 on an Index + new PC.\n\nEDIT: I forgot about haptics.\n\nEDIT 2: The tracking issues were being caused by interference from my Index base stations.  Tracking is still not flawless like Index, but it's acceptable now.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":84020,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PSVR2 vs. Index (TL;DR: Index is overall better, but PSVR2 is also great and an excellent Index \"companion\")","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.91,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/11awsj3\/psvr2_vs_index_tldr_index_is_overall_better_but\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"OneTrueRaiden","author_created_utc":1637320429,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_gdt2ay7p","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1677149567,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"119uv7g","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_119uv7g","no_follow":false,"num_comments":4,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/119uv7g\/is_there_a_place_to_check_when_the_index_is\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1678317089,"score":7,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"My bad if you guys get these types of posts all the time, mods feel free to delete if this is the case.    \n\n\nAlso, I am wondering if there is a site somewhere to keep track of this?

I checked my computer usage never went over 30% on anything not even single thread performance.  \n\n- setup was really easy and actually fun to do, base stations are temporarily on the ground and my desk which works absolutely fine considering i have a wall of windows.   \n\n- honestly i dont think its index's fault but its really really stupid that i dont have access to anything on windows, (there was a software on steam that apparently lest you use windows as an overlay in vr which im probably going to get. Really annoying that i have to take the headset off to do anything outside of vr, for example i want to access my spotify to look for song names to add to beatsaber. No can do.  \n\n- eyes getting dry from the heat (people have suggested frunk fans which im probably going to get. \n\n- front heavy, use pennies.\n\n- no motion sickness, happy!!! Yes weird brain, that tries to balance me thinking im falling, less happy but funny!!! \n\n- playing superhot, I \"YAAGAA\"ed my cable more than 4 times in an hour,  no i cannot get ceiling hanging stuff, no i cant get a pole. Im in a shared apartment and the fact that roommates let me setup in the living room is nice enough of them. Everyone says to attach the caple to the back by something, they dont say how hard.  \n\n- dont know if i mentioned it yet but every time i restart me pc or want to olay something, index hmd isnt an option is sound so i have to open troubleshoot, the moment i open it, it comes up and i select it. Kinda annoying. Any fix? (Ive tried generic fixes like restarting, disconnecting, different usb, drivers all up to date. My other sound device is steelseries  nova pro, has a DAC which is always powered by a usb just like index. \n\n- people say ipd of 70.5 is fine. IT ISNT!!! at least for me. I was trying to see what is wrong with my placement, (my accurate ipd is just under 70.5 determined today in an eye exam) and by a lot of weird angling i managed to put two fingers in from the nose slot and while wearing the headset push the lenses apart. This made me see much more clear and make around the center of vision look clear which is not the case with. (I further experimented and tried closing my eyes in an alternative manner and tried looking for the sweet spot on each eye, found out adjusted to the highest ipd my left eye's sweet spot is looking a bit right and vice versa. Question is, will jamming a bunch of napkins in the middle of the lenses break the headset in the long run? This thing is as flimsy as a branch and i really dont wanna break it... Note that ill be getting lenses since i have to wear glasses (numbers are 1 and 1.25 so im fine without them) and its important for the ipd to be adjusted accurately for lenses.  \nI do like the index overall its a great product, i dont want to return it just because my ipd doesnt match the range... Any suggestion for the ipd issue is very appreciated, i understand this is something minor for most people but as someone that has had poor eyesight all his life and hated it, this is super annoying to me.  \n\nAlso just wanted to say, im having a GREAT time. The feeling of seeing the games you just played when you close your eyes at night was a nostalgia from my early childhood that hasnt happened to me eversince GTA San Andreas when i was a kid.\n\nSome things in the games. Laugh at me being a total noob lol.  \nBeatsaber is hard, (hard is easy and expert is impossible for me.  \nRumble: never thought i had to learn form to play a game. Never thought i would be EARTHBENDING sooooo awesome!!!!  \nSuperhot: super fun and super frustrating when you die.  \nFriends say pavlov is dead? Should i refund?  \nFriends say get vail. Should I?  \nAlso looking for a throw destruction type game if anyone has suggestions.  \nLooking forward to 3d sculpt as well ill update here! \n\nLast but not least, any way to mess with my girlfriend while she is playing? She is asking for horror titles im really not interested in spending money on them since i dont play them, but i wanna get like a beatsaber jumpscare mod or any jumpscare mod to happen to her; any suggestions? \n\n\n(I will put some edits under here, im getting into the games and all, will probably have another post in a week or most probably in a month to update.)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":83695,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"second

what ive seen the best idea is to get a new cable, but it hasnt bothered me enough for me to go ahead and make the purchase.\n\nhowever, the past couple times ive used my headset ive been having more severe problems in which im unsure the cause of. theres been a couple of times where the screens go grey like its searching for base stations (and will disconnect my microphone for a moment), but im in full view of my two base stations. my playspace is fairly small and there are a few possible blockers but my headset has not done this to this extent before.\n\nalong with this, three times tonight my headset has crashed, the screen goes grey again and i can still hear things going on around me for a little bit, then it goes black and all steamvr says is that it has \"encountered a critical

THIS BEFORE YOU WRITE OFF AS A COMMON POST: I know this is a common post type but EVERY POST I\u2019ve looked at has not solved my issue. Plus I suck at unique titles. So with that in mind, I\u2019d really appreciate all the help I can get. If this post gets deleted I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be able to do to fix this. \n\nAlright, so I\u2019ll start with the actual HMD. I thought my head was pretty large, but I pretty much have to use the bumper pad. My head is by no means small, but without it the index just doesn\u2019t stay on at full tightness in the back.\n\nThe problem is that when I use the pad the index facial interface starts pushing into my forehead and cheeks. So bad it hurts. So I tried the main suggestions of \u201cit\u2019s too tight\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s too low\/high on your head.\u201d But no matter how I adjust it I just can\u2019t get this thing to stay on my head without digging into my face. If I put my finger on the edge of the interface with it snug, the soft material is just flat against the HMD and it\u2019s easy to feel the plastic. Any looser and the headset starts to slide off of my head at slight movement. \n\n\nOkay, controller time. Even with the straps all the way to the lowest position, my thumbs are above the touchpad. If I loosen the straps, I can position my hands right, but the second I open my fingers they slide back upwards to above the touchpad. I don\u2019t have the money to buy any accessories right now, so if I fix something it has to be with the headset. There\u2019s got to be something I\u2019m doing wrong. Please help! I love this thing but I can\u2019t play it for more than 15 or so minutes without it causing serious head pain. Thank you to the amazing person who fixes it! \n\nAnd side note: this is my 3rd headset.

Going by this is my USB  Type-C port directly connected to my Nvidia GPU?:\n\n[http:\/\/pdsoasis.github.io\/thunderbird.jpg](http:\/\/pdsoasis.github.io\/thunderbird.jpg)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":83056,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Is my USB Type-C port wired directly to my Nvidia GPU?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/zlaqo0\/is_my_usb_typec_port_wired_directly_to_my_nvidia\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"[deleted]","author_created_utc":null,"author_flair_background_color":"","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":"dark","awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":false,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1670861146,"crosspost_parent":"t3_zjwzz1","crosspost_parent_list":[{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"approved_at_utc":null,"approved_by":null,"archived":false,"author":"_Abnormalia","author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_5cgjwxqm","author_is_blocked":false,"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_at_utc":null,"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"clicked":false,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created":1670846342.0,"created_utc":1670846342.0,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"youtu.be","downs":0,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"zjwzz1","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":false,"is_video":false,"likes":null,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":{"oembed":{"author_name":"VR Kemono","author_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@VRKemono","height":200,"html":"&lt;iframe width=\"356\" height=\"200\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/TesWTi9iRdo?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

The latency 100% did increase however if they were all active cables or just plain fibre cables then it would be great with technically better latency (not noticable at all cause of communication protocols and translation from fibre to digital but better than active and non-active).\n\nThe Index's cable length is quite disappointing and every option is to just buy extensions and I don't like that as a solution especially since the latency can be an issue and it just adds thick parts to the cable that you can either step on, break or let heat up. So I was thinking if there was any demand I might look into making a custom cable that is fibre based so the latency will be great up to hundreads of meters (if needed) although I'd make it only 10-15 meters (33-50 feet). I've done stuff like this before but not for VR, for other types of projects that needed multiple different types of data lines and a long length display port connection up to 4k and I know it's not difficult for me but the custom connector is a pain cause I may have to saccrifice a cable and to make the cable look normal could be a pain unless manufactured.\n\nIf there is demand and I succeed I was thinking of commercialising it however I either think there isnt enough demand or it wont be too profitable. If you are a Index user and would like a 10m cable let me know how much you would pay for a good quality one just so I have a rough idea, keep in mind the price for a replacement is $120 USD and is only 5m. By good quality I mean a durable cable that isnt thick or split into 3. Just one nice cable. Also keep in mind that fibre isnt that cheap, look up fibre display port cables and base it off that (not the ones that are $1000, cause they are just ripping people off)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":83057,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Longer Valve Index Cable","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.33,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/zjdf8p\/longer_valve_index_cable\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Endet15","author_created_utc":1467600811,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_z7zc1","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1668803796,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"yyty6m","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_yyty6m","no_follow":true,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/yyty6m\/error_when_attempting_to_change_controller\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1673211284,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Trying to change controller bindings in VRChat.

For months now, my left controller seemingly pretty randomly loses tracking for fractions of a second (does NOT fly off though). Sometimes it disconnects entirely. Very rarely the right controller disconnects as well, but it's 99% the left. \n\nI've tried everything I can think of, and all the suggestions I find online:\n\n* Removed all reflections (this has happened in 3 different rooms, one of those being in a different apartment)\n* Tried all the USB ports, including unplugging everything unnecessary\n* Used a PCIe USB card (tried two different ones, one of which is the famous Inatek one)\n* Redone room setup (many times)\n* Changed the way I'm facing 90\/180 degrees (to check whether it's a base station issue)\n* Reinstalled windows (fresh) 3 times, the latest being Windows 11\n* Recalibrated the IMU in the headset\n* Unpaired controllers and repaired them\n* Tried a different set of Index Controllers (same issue)\n* Unplugged my monitor while playing\n* Checked it's not performance related (I get consistent 90fps, and there are no spikes in the performance graph when it happens)\n* Tried many different versions of my graphics drivers\n\nMy steamvr log (as seen below), based on all the other posts like [this one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/d83b24\/random_total_loss_of_tracking\/), suggest it's a USB bandwidth issue, but using a PCIe USB card has not fixed anything for me.\n\nAs you can see in the log, it has many \"Unexpected sample before sync\", and \"Triggered keepalive\" entries, which I assume is related to the issue.\n\nCouple notes:\n\n* I don't believe it's related to \"IMU went off scale\", because that also happens to my right controller and it's not correlated to the loss of tracking\n* Not every entry of \"Triggered keepalive\" results in a noticeable tracking loss, I believe some instances are too short to notice\n\nEDIT: Stuff I forgot to mention:\n\n* The loss of tracking is most noticeable when playing fast\/intense Beat Saber maps, likely because the small dropouts that might not be noticeable on slow maps are suddenly noticeable\n* There was a time when I seemingly didn't have this issue, however it *might* be just that I got better at beat saber and started playing faster maps (and therefore noticed the problem)\n* I tested with vanilla beat saber (no mods)\n* The only thing I haven't tried is a different computer, but that's a bit tricky\n\nSo, I plead, does anyone have any other ideas I can try?\n\nSome system specs: i7 6700K, AMD 5700XT, 32GB RAM. Mobo is AsRock z170 K6+ Fatality\n\nHere's my log from a 20-25min session (EDIT: truncated due to post length limit).

everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just ordered a valve index a couple days ago to play games and also development in unreal engine. I then remembered a scene from the game Heavy Rain where the main character loaded into a virtual world and did his work in the middle of nature. I've seen there are a few programs such as Immersed, Virtual Desktop, and OVR Toolkit. My work will consist of coding so I would need a couple virtual monitors to see Unreal Engine and also have my code on another. I would also like to see my keyboard since I would be typing a lot.

Long story short, i would highly appreciate a bit more cable. Something like 2meters would already be plenty. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking for solutions everyone keeps recommending many hella expensive cables. Displayport and USB alike. Wouldnt a simple Displayport 1.4 Male to Female Cable be enough though? If im not wrong, the Headset itself connects into this Trident with a simple Displayport cable. Near the End of this cable you can unplug it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my idea would be to just insert a high quality displayport cable between the Headset and the Trident connector. I would guess a passive cable should be enough for the length i need. I would then not need any USB or Power Cable extensions, right? Or is there anything ive missed. It seems to simple of a solution, since everyone is breaking their heads about different types of cables, active\/ passive solutions and USB\/Displayport etc etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould appreciate any help possible. Thank you so much already!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBtw.: i was thinking about this cable specifically.

It should umbrella all the index devices underneath \u201cValve VR Radio &amp; HMD Mic\u201d - though i think the display device will get separated somewhere as a generic hdmi monitor\n\nRemove any greyed out device under\n\n\u2022\t\u2060the audio section at the top\n\n-the game controllers, audio section toward the bottom\n\nCant remember the exact name of those sections but they both have a sound icon\n\nIf you have ever used DDU to uninstall display and or audio, make sure you opened it back up and click \u201cchange windows settings to automatically install\u201d - right under the main start button on the main screen of ddu\n\nTo be sure you can type in windows search bar \u201cchange device installation settings\u201d and make sure its set to automatically install.\n\nThen shutdown, connect the index and boot. The index sound devices don\u2019t show up if it\u2019s set to direct display mode, unless you have steam vr running. The microphone device will but not the output device.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work or if prefer to reinstall all index device drivers , do the same process but in addition to the two audio sections in device manager, remove hidden devices in monitors near the top and\n*important detail i failed to mention* start from the bottom of these usb devices and go up. If you delete the hub or controller first, they will all disappear but the devices drivers won\u2019t get uninstalled, only device manager won\u2019t include them even as hidden devices*\n Usb, or Universal hub controllers at the bottom of device manager - and again make sure the index is unplugged when you do. \n\n\nEdit- using the uninstall steamvr devices in steamvr developer settings fails to find some of the hidden devices that don\u2019t get recognized. I realized a while ago that if you switch USB ports, or sometimes for some other reason, the need devices get enumerated again and you\u2019ll see all 5 usb devices have a second set of hidden devices that are disconnected, when your headset is on. This seems to cause issues so anytime something seems off i check device manager for hidden USB devices and uninstall all of them. An easy way to see the effect, if there is an issue with an index usb device, you can go to the Bluetooth devices settings page (double click Bluetooth icon in system tray) and if the index doesn\u2019t say connected to USB 3.0 under it, you can be pretty sure the problem is there. Reload that page after uninstalling the hidden devices, and it should then say connected to USB 3.0","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":80811,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Troubleshoot tip: My go to fix for issues like no sound, headset not detected, or usb related problems","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.96,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/xgr06k\/troubleshoot_tip_my_go_to_fix_for_issues_like_no\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"bearCatBird","author_created_utc":1250982021,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3lkje","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1662185526,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"x4n9g0","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_x4n9g0","no_follow":false,"num_comments":23,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/x4n9g0\/how_do_i_build_a_vr_game\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1665462191,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Anyone have experience making a VR game?

purchased a valve index system in August 2019, since then I have had 4 trigger failures on 4 different right hand controllers. Depending on what type of games you play, if you play games that require most intensive trigger use, such as shooting games, your trigger will fail, you will know when this happens when it starts sticking. The failure happens at the pivot point on the plastic trigger, considering how much you play. Mine averages 9 months between failures, with a replacement cost of $149. \n\nUp until recently, Valve would replace the broken controller even if it was over the warranty period, but now they refuse. Doing some research, this failure has been happening for years, yet Valve never fixed it. It is surprising that they didn\u2019t replace the cheap plastic trigger with more durable material. \n\nI love the system but it might be time to move on with rumors of new headsets to come out this year or in 2023.

  \nI've been using VR daily for over 2 years, but only because I was able to modify my rift S to take all of the weight off of my face, the headset being entirely supported by the halo-type headstrap.\n\nA photo of my rift S (cardboard to block out ambient light, custom cut to almost touch my face), along with an Internet photo of how the headset can rest entirely on the head, not the face.   \n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vYpXQfU](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vYpXQfU)\n\nWith my hypersensitivity, combined with sensitive skin, any type of pressure on the face, especially on the cheeks, will make me very uncomfortable, and thus make VR unplayable to me. \n\nI recently bought a Valve Index to finally upgrade the setup, thinking I'd attempt a similar mod (It's widely described as a comfortable headset). I was frustrated to find out that the halo strap design is pretty unique to the rift S (and PSVR). The Valve Index is designed around having the face gasket pushed against the face to stabilise the headset.\n\nI haven't found a possible way to take the pressure off my face.  I've tried all possible ways of positioning the Index, with and without additional padding. I even cut off the bottom half of a face gasket to just take the pressure off of my cheeks. Nothing works for me. \n\nThe only possible way I see working is if I would entirely replace the headband with a 3rd party halo headstrap like this one, but that's a very deep modification, there would be no going back.   \n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/0qcmI4H](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/0qcmI4H)  \nThis strap is designed for Quest 2, but the contact points are in the right place to attach to an index. However, this might ruin the slider for repositioning the lenses. Not worth it?\n\nUnless I find a way to make this work, I'll have to sell this index again. It's a sad reality.\n\nThere's a bigger point to this: I can't believe I'd be the only person who can't handle a headset pushing into their cheeks. Yet every single recent headset is designed to be pushed into the face. I haven't seen any recent design (except the hyper expensive Varjo xr3) that is built around a headlocking strap.  \n[https:\/\/store.varjo.com\/Product%20images\/XR3.media.03.jpg](https:\/\/store.varjo.com\/Product%20images\/XR3.media.03.jpg?resizeid=5&amp;resizeh=1100&amp;resizew=1880)  \nWill I have to search around for any remaining Rift S hardware and only ever be able to use that in the future? Am I so unique in how I can't wear most headsets? \n\nAny advice is appreciated. I'm okay with putting in some work to make this Index comfortable for my situation, if there is any good way.

was lucky to be gifted a Valve Index in 2019, I've spent roughly 8+ hours a day every day using the kit, it is part of my treatment and thus very important, its a life line (will always be grateful to

I also have a bHaptic vest and Tundra trackers.\n\nI started with 2 base stations, then 3 and now  4.\n\nMy room in which I do VR and stream is my living room, I have about 2.5m by 1.8m of usable space.\n\nMy tether is in a pulley system and my Index is always connected.\n\nMy Base stations never go to sleep and always in On mode.\n\n(Two lighthouses I had diagonal corners on light stands)\n\n(Three lighthouses I had in a triangle formation)\n\n(Four in the four corners of the room)\n\nOver the years I have come across 2 main types of issue that effect tracking.\n\n1)Room related.\n\nMirrors, Monitors, TV, Pictures on walls, Windows.\n\nReflection is obvious but also I saw occlusion from my old central lamp shade.\n\nEasy to diagnose and avoid, I keep my curtains closed, I have a blanket to over my big TV and so on.\n\n2)Hardware related\n\nIf you discount faulty light houses or controllers and so on.\n\nThis one was different and harder to diagnose over the years and I believe it comes down to the hardware of your PC USB resources Bluetooth resources.\n\nNearly everything we connect to a PC these days is Bluetooth or USB, and you can get some really crappy chipsets or they just skimp on things.\n\nFor example my current gaming setup is a laptop now a lot of people won't touch a gaming laptop but after research I found it fit me perfectly.\n\nThe CPU was fine an AMD 5800h  8 core 16 threads, memory was fine 32gb of fast memory, storage was 2TB M2 fast storage and the graphics card was a 3070RTX with a TDP of 141w It pretty much plays everything  on ultra but.\n\nWith VR I was seeing glitches and tracking issues and after Valve sent me a 4th Lighthouse (long term loan) so we could look into it more and rule out any occlusion issues.\n\nIt was only showing up in games like SkyrimVr or VRchat where your hand might be still for awhile or move, Twitches would occur and other things.\n\nIn the end it came down to USB resources on the laptop, the solution is simple if I want 100% tracking with no glitches at all and an 8 hour play through (Full body tracking included) I remove my streaming camera, my external keyboard and mouse, my dogcam, my usb hubs.  (I now do this automatically when using VR.\n\nAnd at that point no glitches or issues in VR.\n\nThis problem can happen on Desktop PC's but shows up more on a laptop because you can't just put an extra USB card into a spare slot and USB hubs can cause interference and resources are more limited.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79074,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My light house experiences. with glitches and my work around.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.64,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vke5lh\/my_light_house_experiences_with_glitches_and_my\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":true,"archived":false,"author":"bearCatBird","author_created_utc":1250982021,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3lkje","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1655920017,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"viayyr","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_viayyr","no_follow":false,"num_comments":24,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/viayyr\/finally_got_my_vr_legs_for_anyone_still_looking\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657101952,"retrieved_utc":1657101952,"score":53,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I tried Half Life Alyx and Walking Dead for a year but would get sick.

And in settings, you can set your movement speed. So I kept teleportation as my default movement, but would occasionally fly around at super slow speeds. Over time I increased the speed and if I ever felt sick I would just lower the speed until it felt fine. I played minigolf every day for an hour and tried to fly each time. I think it took a few weeks, maybe a month to get to full speed. Then my brain just clicked.\n\nIt's been a game changer! Literally!

Anyway here's the list:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Backrooms Virtual Reality \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1922060\/BrVR_Backrooms_Virtual_Reality\/\n\nWe're off to a good start if we're starting with recent memes.  let's move on to something hopefully less stupid (7 gigabytes big!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Battle Talent VR  \u2013 1.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1331510\/Battle_Talent\/\n\nI remember trying this game a long time ago, it wasn't anything special as a dungeon-fighting game but did seem really early to judge, so it was surprising to see this year's later in the demos and it feels... almost exactly the same?  I did the tutorial and got stuck on the menu, so by the time I was curious to play nothing was really there so show?  All you do is run, pick up a weapon and kill a couple of skeletons.  That's really it, I mean, the skeletons DID lose their jaws when attacking, that was neat by everything else was an incomplete by-the-books experience.  If I actually had played a working battle, maybe it be rated higher, so unless there's something very important I missed out, pass on this one.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Death Duel VR  \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1932360\/Death_Duel_VR\/\n\nVery clunky and poorly made sword fighting experience.  There's really nothing I can say on this one, pass.  Not a good opening batch of games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Blockstar VR  \u2013 2.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1781110\/BlockStar_VR\/\n\nIt was alright, some of the features of this game are really neatly presented such as the intro cinematic in a 360' view, and the lift door being shunted around.  But the main core of the gameplay is a little... empty?  The tutorial didn't really give me a good idea what the best way to shoot blocks down or even what certain ones meant, but when there was many blocks on the screen it became a bit frustrating than actually a fun challenge.  I like the presentation of the world but the gameplay is a bit plain &amp; repetitive for something introduced so well.  Also the game had an Unreal engine crash during the lift of tutorial 1, just so you know dev on my first playthrough.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gamecine \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1298620\/GAMECINE\/\n\nOh god I forgot about this crap, why did you have to make me remember this crap.  Hey, a Dinosaur!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Grid Leaper  \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1614990\/Grid_Leaper\/\n\nNow that's better!  I wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as I did.  This is a block-climbing experience where you have to go reach the end in the quickest time possible, although I'm not certain if you have to touch every block since some missions I got 3 out of 5 stars, so there was something I was doing wrong.  It's simple in the best way and fun to play, although by the end of it I was getting a little tired, so a bit more variety and visual interest would make this a solid climbing experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Kayak VR Mirage \u2013 4\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1683340\/Kayak_VR_Mirage\/\n\nI think many people here played this before the festival like me.  Really solid kayak experience, with outstanding graphics.  I will admit, I'm terrible at this game and can barely get started, but I do eventually get going again, so I wont hold the game against this since I know its generally good (even if its not for me), although I wish I could be the type of player that would enjoy this more than it is and wish the controls were generally easier for me to navigate with, even casually, which is why I can't rate it higher since its a big negative for me, although I understand its done this way for a more hardcore purpose. Regardless, if you've not played this, this is a must check out game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Maestro  \u2013 3\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1327920\/Maestro_VR\/\n\nA very different approach to the music-genre of VR experiences, and it works for the most part.  You have to control the timing of instruments of when and how they get played in your band, and its interesting, although the visual interface is pretty dull and could be presented better (It doesn't have to be fancy, just easier to navigate and understand).  I found it difficult to understand the differences of instruments through an icon alone, so whilst I see a good experience, there's a lot of problems inside that I believe can be address before completion.  Fine experience, worth checking out if you like kind of thing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mayhem on a Rainbow VR \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1594690\/Mayhem_on_a_Rainbow__VR\/\n\nAh yes, Bootleg Simulator VR, my favourite!  Pass.  Even if it was being spoof in its design, it's still a pass.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Plasmatic \u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1938360\/PLASMATIC\/\n\nThis game was already dull in its theme and presentation (white room, robot voice, been there, done that many times) so when it wants me to turn objects in the most awkward angle possible and punish you and restart if you fail, yeah, don't bother with this one.  Believe me, I gave the turning a fair chance to make certain I wasn't making it harder than it had to be, and it really was just that bad.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Pungi VR \u2013 0.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1900020\/PunjiVR\/\n\nYou know when your guns hold in a vertical 45' angle downward, we're going to have a hell of a time.  Well, a short time.  I can't even pickup the weapons correctly, and enemies kill you in a couple of shot.  All I can say about this experience is that it ain't me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Ruins Magus \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1701560\/RUINSMAGUS\/\n\nThis was... surprisingly great.  No really, anime and all.  First of all thank you for making a tutorial that doesn't go on forever and is generally fair with its information (you're going to need it) but for a dungeon fighting game it looks and plays really great (the opening building looks amazing!), I was enjoying it a lot but it does have a learning curve and you will mess up your spells at first, but I did get better at the very end.  Now here comes the big faults and why its rated lower than it should be, the theme, the anime theme, its not great.  But terrible but it really puts all the effort put into everything else for this game in a generic garbage looking world.  I'm not against anime style, but I am against plain worlds which no creativity.  It reminds me a lot like Zenith in its presentation (although this already plays much better), but guys come on, hire some art directions please for the love of god.  I would also say I did die on the boss and it wasn't easy to deal with unlike the dungeon which you can take your time, so even the gameplay has its faults, but its overall worth checking but please don't judge it JUST on the anime 101 front, there's more to see than just that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Shibainu - VR Katana Simulator \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1877780\/Shibainu__VR_Katana_Simulator\/\n\nIt does what it does.  You slice things, with physics.  I couldn't see much else to it, so I like to rate it higher but its a once slice trick.  Although I have to say I don't know if was an Index problem or not, but the gripping of the weapon wasn't that great and made the experience a lot harder than it should be.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Space Salvage Demo \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829260\/Space_Salvage\/\n\nNow this is more my kind of game, owning a spaceship, picking up loot in a comfy artstyle spaceship.  It felt great to look and play... well mostly.  it was a little hard to control the throttle, as you're either going too fast or reversing too much and couldn't centralize it a lot, and the demo was mostly the same thing over and over again.  It was real charming at first, but got old quick.  I really wish this demo had more to do than just pick up loot, because I can see a real winner with this game if had more variety, and something I've personally really want more in VR, well-made simulations and art-styled games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Spy Robot - Gateways to Humanity\u2013 1\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1834640\/Spy_Robot_Gateways_To_Humanity\/\n\nI don't really get it.  This game is presented as a randomly generated maze with a series of weapons, but the weapons... don't do anything? I'm not a fan of \"text-only\" tutorials, but I had to double check that I was playing this correctly and I can't really get that far because of this, the enemies just beat you up.  Unless its a major bug, I don't consider this game an unplayable demo, just a poorly thought out experience.  There's much better games out with similar themes (see Sweet Surrender etc)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tiny Island \u2013 3.5\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1431430\/Tiny_Island\/\n\nAlmost a solid concept game.  You control a spirit that helps people holding chopsticks in an Asian-inspired setting, you pick up objects with the chopsticks (this also includes the environment and clouds!) and it generally looks pretty good.  How it plays however... the engine needs some work, I know its chopsticks and all but it was really hard to pick up a lot of objects in this game, I know it mentions you have to be careful and patient but it was still tricky, and since the whole game is based around this core gameplay I would like to try this game again in the future once its a little easier to grab things.  Also I had to stop anyway since the tutorial wouldn't let me get any further past the cart, not sure what I was missing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tomb Explorer \u2013 2\/5**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1969920\/Tomb_Explorer_VR\/\n\nWhat an amazing visual to see ingame, that beautiful temple.  Ok we're done with the review.  But seriously, everything felt flat and empty compared to the opening visual-shot, my first instinct was to head straight to the temple but the bridge wouldn't let pass (you have to follow the markers around it), which was a quick disappointment.  But after following the basic steps to arriving at the temple (as great as it looks) it was more of the same thing, pretty basic approach to exploring and climbing without being anything special or stands out from other experiences other than exploring the temple.  I admit, I did get further past the traps, but I saw what I needed to see and there wasn't anything left to motivate me to keep exploring as the gameplay felt pretty hollow and basic.  I wasn't too certain if this was meant to be a game or a visual tour, I think it would serve much better as the latter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\nThese games were unable to be tested\/reviewed, but are still linked for others to see:\n---\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**B3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/624950\/B3\/\n\nThe game was not well responsive to the Index Controls, I could not get out the tutorial switching weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Bookstore Simulator**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1706980\/Bookstore_Simulator\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dixotomia**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1367710\/Dixotomia\/\n\nI can't move or control anything on the main screen.  This does not work correctly for me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Down Fast VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1956860\/Down_Fast_VR\/\n\nThis bicycle game keeps drifting me to the left-side, no button seems to work (and it's not my controllers).  I did have fun crashing downhill into a tree, but I would really like to actually play the game first.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Burial Stone**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1910360\/Burial_Stone\/\n\nI've always wanted to see how a turn-based dungeon crawler would work in VR.  Sadly I still have to keep waiting, since the controls seem buggy, I can't get out the first room (movement sometimes doesn't work correctly, can't do anything!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Dream Catcher VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1951490\/Dream_Catcher_VR\/\n\nThis does not load in VR\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Escape from Mandrilla** (2.5\/5?)\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1936360\/Escape_From_Mandrillia\/\n\nI was originally going to say I was mixed feelings on this, I liked the horror atmosphere, but hated the lack of interface and navigation.  But I didn't realize this was a VR vs Local PC game experience until after quitting (which would explain the lack of enemies), It didn't say anything like this when I played it, so I can't really judge it without playing it correctly.  It didn't look too bad, but I had no idea where my gun was (plenty of ammo though) so I don't think I would've gone far.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Flashout 3**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1761870\/FLASHOUT_3\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gardenia VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1901690\/Gardenia_VR\/\n\nI cannot move in this game, it responds to the controllers but no button seems to get me started.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Guardian Mage**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1829740\/Guardian_Mage_VR\/\n\nThe menu button does not respond.  I am unable to get started in this game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRANDMA**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1727550\/GRANDMA\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?).  Not sure If I wanted to play this one anyway from that cover\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Hyperstacks**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1046760\/Hyperstacks\/\n\nI can't get the dash to work with the Index Controllers (little mini-jumps) and can't complete the tutorial.  It seemed charming, but I cant judge the rest yet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Just Upstream**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1925850\/Just_Upstream\/\n\nI... I don't know what to do.  I'm stuck on the main menu, it tells me to open a menu, I did that... and thats it.  I played around the map, buttons and the menu and I couldn't get started.  Can anyone help me out with this one?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Mount Wingsuit 2**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1957680\/Mount_Wingsuit_2\/\n\nIt doesn't seem like I can do much to play this one.  You fall down, try and aim for the hoops, but no button or turning I've tried can reach it and the map just restarts.  I can't tell if its the game or is generally just bugged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Outmode**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1860700\/Outmode\/\n\nThis does not load in VR (is it even a VR title?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Paradox of Hope**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1702840\/Paradox_of_Hope_VR\/\n\nThe game is really hard to grip and control items, the tutorial wont let me pass unless I grab everything on my chest, but I spend a good 5 minutes trying to pick up my knife, and I can't really go any further unless its actually playable.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Tin Hearts**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1831700\/Tin_Hearts\/\n\nThis does not load in VR, and this time I do know its a VR title.  One I've been looking forward to playing, which is a real shame.  I hope they can fix this before the end of the festival.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Requisition VR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1730650\/REQUISITION_VR\/\n\nThe demo is multiplayer only and I didn't find any players.  From what I saw already, it looks ok, pretty much what you expect in a survival zombie game without originality or flair.  Mediocre at its finest.#\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**RFVR**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1743570\/RFVR\/\n\nThe game crashes when I try and leave the starter village.  I know its a big game and all, but for 12 gigabytes download it certainly looked pretty crude and didn't grab any attention even if it didn't crash.  I'm sure it has some interesting ideas from what I've seen of the screenshot, but the visuals really do look ugly that I would have a hard time to get through this and review it correctly, presentation is everything folks, and this doesn't have it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Snipe Hunt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1975370\/Snipe_Hunt\/\n\nI couldn't really get started, it tells to pick up some items and than gets soft-locked and wont proceed further.  I had a look around but it just sends you back to where I started.  I don't there's much to check out here even if it did work (and what was up with that awful perspective menu, that was really REALLY ugly!)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Sultans of Egypt**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1911200\/Sultan_Of_Egypt\/\n\nThe game menu wants me to grab an \"orb\" thats out of boundary, I have 2.5x2.5 testing space.  No button grabbed the orb or pulled or did anything either (bad controls again?).  Not able to be tested\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Volcanic Core**\n\nhttps:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1490800\/Volcanic_Core\/\n\nThe game kept drifting my vehicle to the side (much like the Down Fast bicycle game) and was unable to get past the tutorial.  It's a shame, since the retro style of this game made it look real promising to play.  I'm certain its not my controllers since they work on pretty much every other game I own, so I don't know why certain games today are drifting like this.\n\n&amp;nbsp;","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79084,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"June 2022's Steam Next Fest - Every VR game-demo listed (and mini-reviewed)","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vc9u14\/june_2022s_steam_next_fest_every_vr_gamedemo\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Quebber","author_created_utc":1433189640,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_nufca","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":true,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1654773514,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":1654842205.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"v8ejfx","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Discussion"}],"link_flair_template_id":"c676f06e-81d3-11e9-8e65-0ee1984fab2c","link_flair_text":"Discussion","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_v8ejfx","no_follow":false,"num_comments":47,"num_crossposts":1,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/v8ejfx\/moving_my_valve_index_vr_life_over_to_a_laptop_is\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657150026,"retrieved_utc":1657150026,"score":37,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I've always built my own PC since putting together a 386sx in the 90's my current beast of a machine was an AMD 3950x, 32gb 3600mhz, 2080ti, 3 m2 drives and 3 ssd's.\n\nI pretty much live in VR due to it being part of my treatment for my life long situation, Valve gifted me an Index and I've been providing feedback and help ever since.\n\nNow like everywhere the cost of living is going through the roof especially in relation to Electricity costs, I only have Disability coming in and so things had to change.\n\n2 months ago I bought myself a Legion 5 Pro (sold my wife's old SW collection) 5800h CPU, 16gb, 1tb m2 and the most important part a non crippled 141 TDP 3070RTX.\n\nRemoved windows 11, replaced with windows 10, added another m2 drive 1tb and upgraded it to 32GB faster CL22 ram.\n\nTo put it in perspective my old system with 2 monitors drew about 1000W at full use (streaming\/VR)\n\nMy laptop draws 52w idle (92 with the 32\" monitor) and doing VR or flatscreen cyberpunk at ultra draws 211w + 42w for the monitor.\n\nIt runs everything, I've got my FalloutVR modded to the limit, SkyrimVR, VRchat on ultra settings, Beat Saber modded, Half Life Alyx, STO, UEBS2, TLD and so on.\n\nIt is quieter, adds less heat to the room and doesn't thermal throttle.\n\nIf something goes wrong? I pay \u00a310 a month to cover it not only for accidental damage but break downs and if they can't fix it I get a cheque for a new model equivalent.\n\nWhile I still love the idea of building my own system and love messing with tech, I think this is the way I will go from now on.\n\nI was scared it wouldn't be able to handle all that I do, quite surprised.\n\nUpdate: Firstly an apology, I can't prove my power use numbers, all I can say is the power plug I use to check is the same one I've used reliably to test other electronics in my house and everything I use it with reads as right.  I can't screenshot or redo the check of the 984w usage because all that is left of my main PC is the big black case, psu and SSD's M2's. The rest is already sold on Ebay.\n\nWhen I came here to write this post I was very excited, I just wanted to post and show what was working for me, My brain doesn't work like most people no I am not trying to play the victim card I am officially classed as Autistic, Bi-polar type 2, ADHD and PTSD with still waiting on an OCD diagnosis, I am non functioning in real life (as in if you met me on the street I would freeze up and be unable to react or even talk and move until you moved away) VR and technology has made a massive difference to me allowed me to expand my safe place and live not just survive.\n\nElectricity costs in the UK have risen by over 160% in the last year, the only money that comes into my house is Disability + severe disability on top.\n\nMy brain doesn't follow the normal logic of costs and budget at the best of time, for example I spent \u00a31000 in 2016 building a solar array linked to 2 AGM batteries in the back yard, do you think I was thinking of how long it would take me to get back that money I spent? no, all that mattered to me is I could charge every tablet, phone, controller and portable in the house without relying on the grid. why ? because one morning I woke up at 3am and thought \"what happens if the grid fails tomorrow?\" and while a normal person could just wave that thought away, I had to act on it create a solution or I was never going back to sleep.\n\nWhen I realised that my bills for electricity added to other cost of living happenings in the world meant my power usage (given that I am online 18 hours a day and spend at least 8 hours in vr most days) I had to come up with a solution.\n\nNow the kicker is I was expecting to loose out in performance and what I could do, I like a lot of people always looked down on laptops. so when I found that I could play every damn game I love and do all I used to on my main PC for a fraction of the cost I was sooooo happy and I wanted to come and tell you all.\n\nSee I don't have an off switch in my brain, I don't have a filter between what I say and do and I don't know when I am over explaining or saying too much, I have no ulterior motives I have no need for karma or kudos.\n\nI have 14 notifications on reddit now and i'm literally terrified to open it because I know that I will have no choice if I read them to reply and over explain and people will think i'm playing the victim card and I just came here to share something positive!\n\nI am editing this reply and I can't scroll down afterwards because engaging in a conversation like this will wreck me for the day and if you even think \"well you shouldn't be on reddit or the internet then\" then you are part of the problem disabled people face every frikken day.\n\nAs for the mistake I made I did get the math wrong.\n\nWhen I tried to explain the 1000w watt claim that people disputed I couldn't recheck it so I went online and checked wattage usage for my components and I made the mistake of reading the site that says the msi tomahawk mb draws between 170-210w  I didn't realise they were talking with a cpu not on its own so that was my screw up if anything.\n\nI hope from the upvotes some of the replies are positive, I hope you understand why I can't chance reading those replies\n\nOh and from my deep dive of laptops I came up with 2 choices, the Asus Zeph and the lenovo the reason I went with the lenovo even though it's 3dmark score is lower is the Asus Zeph has a soldered in place memory spot so you can only upgrade one stick and that is a no no to me.\n\nHope your all having a great

Which makes sense, a lot of VR games on Steam existed long before the Index and some games just were never updated or the implementation is kinda bad. But, there's a bit of a problem. If you want to play some of these games (in addition to a growing list of other titles with knuckle controller incompatibility\/issues) you need to shell out the extra dough for the Vive Wands or the Occulus Touch to get the experience you want and a broader list of games to play. But the Touch obviously won't work with the type of tracking the Index uses. Which leads me to the Vive Wands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I have a pair of Vive wands from my original Vive but they are incompatible with the new tracking system the Index utilizes. So I would need to shell out the dough for the Vive pro wands. Okay so now let's say I buy the Vive Pro Wands, whatever, drop almost 400 dollars for two of them, that's incredibly steep but guess what, I was never even a fan of this controller to begin with anyway lol and 400 bucks is just so damn much just to use the better 2.0 tracking on the Index headset, with little to no benefit to the new Vive wands themselves. I could step down to my old Vive lighthouses for 1.0 tracking but then I'd lose the new tracking upgrade for the headset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here's my question... Is there another type of VR controller out there that isn't the wands\/knuckles that work with the Index\/Vive line of headsets? In development? Anything?

been trusting of the RMA process up till now. I originally bought an Index kit December 2020. That kit developed dead pixels after like 5 months of use. 6 headset replacements later (all having dead\/stuck pixels upon receiving the replacements) and I'm out of warranty and stuck with a refurbished headset that had 2 dead pixels in the centre of my view.\n\nGreat, so I bought a complete new Index kit since Valve support wouldn't replace the faulty refurb unit they sent me.\n\nWell... The new kit came with a left controller that the joystick grinded and stuck in place when pushed to the right. That's well enough, RMA and replace the controller.\n\nThe headset thankfully doesn't have any dead pixels! However the headset has all the signs of a bad cable from factory (sparkle). Valve sent me a new cable and the issue still happens. I tested this new cable on my old dead pixel'd headset and it doesn't sparkle.\n\nThe sparkle issue in question: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a0fIOD91nGM\n\nSo at this point I'm pretty sure the brand new, from factory, also is faulty (most likely the port on the headset where the cable plugs into).\n\nI'm typing this out to point out that some of us have extreme issues with the hardware and no amount of dealing with Valve's RMA process seems to fix the issues once and for all.

Valve impresses with customer service early but then clearly only views the warranty period as a legal obligation to get past in the end, and Valve is not making any revisions or changes to defective hardware it continues to sell.  This will be their approach to the Stream Deck and their Next VR hardware as well.\n\nValve designs, develops, and manufacturers products with specs and performance we want.  Their interest in our satisfaction and our value stops there.  Should Valve happen to get a product right then of course it will be awesome because of this.  The reality is almost no new product, especially with innovative design, hits the market without any hitches.    Letting those hitches remain and then knowingly continuing to sell defective products is why the flaws of the Index are completely unacceptable.  The reason I am done buying Valve hardware is the Steam deck is also pushing some boundaries on form and function.  It's going to have problems unless Valve took the lessons and losses of Index customers and used them to improve the Stream Deck which it hopes will reach more people.  Perhaps we were expendable as customers, but Stream Deck customers won't be.  Regardless if we don't want to get burned on hardware at the very least we need to let others be the guinea pigs for several months.  We also need to accept rather than dismiss emerging patterns of flaws and defects.\n\nI have some recommendations for VR with this reality in mind.  If a person isn't going with a Quest 2 then Index controllers are the only option for proper layout, ergonomics and function of a controller.  They have finger tracking, but its' not worth dealing with the defects, except there is no other non meta alternative.  Also people should buy two base station 1.0's rather than the kit with 2 2.0's because the failure rate of the 2.0's is really high and few people actually benefit from them verses 1.0.  The 1.0's last and last and last.  They can be replaced for $134 brand new.  If they can be found the 2.0's are $200.  The HMD is hard to avoid in cost and features but if a person wants to have long lasting use of their HMD  then they should strongly consider alternatives and do their best to factor reliability into their comparisons.\n\nThe Vive pro 2 seems to be a solid headset, but it's over-priced.  Maybe it's worth risking having to purchase a new Index HMD when a person saves $300 each time.  In that case the Index experience is superb while it works.\n\nMy choice is a used Vive Pro 1that I will be doing a gear VR lens mod on.  I saved $200 on it verses another Index HMD.  The verdict is still out but extensive research leaves me confident that the modded Vive pro will be a device that allows me to find contentment with my setup until a future upgrade option is compelling rather than having to spend $500 to buy the same experience I already had while hoping it doesn't burn me before I have a better option in the future.\n\nIf a person is the type to buy the latest and greatest regardless of cost, value, or need, then the Index is their kit.  For everyone else who sees $1000 as painful short term but an investment long term, the Index is most likely going to miss that mark at $200, $300, or $500 per strike.  The controllers  are really unavoidable but the base station 2.0's and the HMD are not.\n\nSomehow if we want better hardware and to be valued by companies we have to cut off the hardware and companies that burn us as much as possible.\n\nI don't like buying tech.  I like using it.  If I do buy tech I want an upgrade so that I can be content with my new tech enough to use it not shop for replacements .  So with that the Index appeared to be the device I could be content with, but it fails to be a device that doesn't need to be replaced.  It really sucks because I'm so close yet so far away from contentment because of the Index.  I might be able to repair my HMD lenses to an acceptable level if not fully.  Regardless, I had to make a change if I wanted my experience to change.  Valve really doesn't care.\n\nFinal thought to fanboys who think they care, when you are doing your next RMA pay attention.  Every reply comes from someone new and many using silly gamer tags who may not be a real person at all.  No one is personally invested in your situation and your experience.  This is by design because when you don't care about your customers empathy is bad for business.  We don't have many choices in the VR space but we do have some choices.
