Anyway, so I unpause the game and suddenly I notice a sort of marker at the position where I standed when pausing with the steam logo on it (inside the game and VR Home as well).\n\nI tried to go back in the dashboard and then couldn't use the knuckles to point, as the cursor now seems to be binded with the headset itself and it keeps clicking all the time so it's a nightmare to navigate. I go back to the PC, go in the settings, and I see nothing out of the ordinary or that would suggest such an option.\n\nEven worse now the view keeps changing non-stop and menus keep flashing while in VR Home. I updated the headset as I noticed that I missed an update and it fixed nothing. Even when I restart I get this weird behavior.\n\nIs there a way to bring all settings back to default or something? Or did I really fuck up my headset after reinstalling it for the first time in a year or so?","author_fullname":"t2_dmfs25f4","gilded":0,"title":"Really weird behavior after using the in-dashboard desktop view.

I initially didn't plan to make any posts for the in-dev NewUI branch releases, but it's been quite a while (November 2021 I think?) and the big 3.0 release is still a bit further out. Desktop viewing tools are all the rage again too it seems, so I thought it might be a good idea to write about what I've been up to lately.\n\nAs you or may not know, Desktop+ is a free and open-source desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.  \nTo get it right out of the way, if you have no issues with SteamVR's built-in desktop or have one of the commercial offerings, there's probably not much in it for you. Can't offer detailed comparisons since I'm not a user of those other applications, though.\n\nThe NewUI branch of Desktop+ is an effort to offer a more user-friendly interface with additional features stacked on top. New additions pretty much only go here unless they're very trivial to backport to the stable branch. I've been releasing preview builds every now and then since I started working in this.  \nAside from a new coat of paint, it also adds the following:\n\n- Floating settings windows (can be moved anywhere and pinned to use outside of dashboard)\n- Translation support (currently ships with English &amp; German)\n- Fully custom keyboard (layouts are user-definable, currently ships with US-QWERTY &amp; German QWERTZ, also improved input simulation)\n- Custom laser pointer (non-blocking input outside of dashboard, multi-laser input on keyboard)\n- Overlay Bar (better overlay management)\n- Window listing\/management improvements (window state tracking, auto-hiding\/restoration)\n- Better overlay creation (directly select source, drag window out of desktop overlay, get active window from Floating UI)\n- Auto-docking\n- Better Floating UI design (works with any curvature setting)\n- Capture FPS display\n- CEF-based web browser overlays (requires separate [Desktop+ browser component](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlusBrowser\/releases) installed or to be on \"NewUI Preview + Browser\" branch on Steam)\n- Keyboard auto-visibility (appears automatically when focusing a text input field)\n- Customizable drag behavior (force upright orientation\/fixed distance\/snap position)\n- HMD Floor Position origin can optionally spin with user\n- Application profiles (automatically switch overlay profile from SteamVR app launch, trigger actions on start\/exit)\n- Overlay position locking\n- ...and more, probably\n\nIf you're interested in the long version of this, you can start your journey with the [NewUI Preview 1 Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460?emclan=103582791468837125&amp;emgid=2984183718087120350) and work your way up from there. Most posts come with pretty video clips too, so there's those if you don't like reading.  \nOnly a handful of features are still missing compared to the old stable branch at this point, so my general recommendation would be to use the NewUI branch if you're not relying on those.\n\nWith the NewUI branch introduction out of the way, here's what's new in NewUI Preview 10 (compared to 9):\n\n**New:**\n\n- Added application profiles\n- Added overlay position locking\n- Added workarounds for invalid SteamVR dashboard state on launch\n- Floating UI now displays the overlay name when the output is invalid (i.e. window capture lost)\n- \"Focus Window when Pointing at Overlay\" and \"Focus Game when Laser Pointer leaves Overlay\" are now applied to the VR keyboard as well if the focused overlay is a window overlay\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Performance Monitor now caps most performance values to their maximum &amp; ignores very small decimals for average FPS display\n- Floating UI no longer uses fixed sizing for primary dashboard overlay fallback if isn't positioned close to the dashboard\n- Reverted Desktop+ laser pointer workaround from New UI Preview 9 (underlying issue was fixed with SteamVR Beta 1.25.3)\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fixed total desktop cropping size not being set in desktop mode\n- Fixed browser navigation state not being restored after restarting UI process\n- Fixed \"To HMD\" button being offset for dashboard origin overlays\n- Fixed Floating UI initially being position incorrectly after the capture was lost on a window overlay\n- Various other minor UI fixes and adjustments\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/3649639958566433176).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\nDesktop+ is a free and open-source project I'm working on in my spare time. If you're interested in supporting me, you can head over to my [Ko-fi page](https:\/\/ko-fi.com\/elvissteinjr).\n\nThat's it I think. I'm still working on the thing and not all that much is happening in the PCVR space... so business as usual.  \nLet me know if you have any questions or run into trouble.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":84022,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Desktop+ NewUI Preview 10 now available","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.93,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/10ufwm6\/desktop_newui_preview_10_now_available\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Katarina_Of_Arc","author_created_utc":1581821442,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_4yukq2fb","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1673399709,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"108r90a","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_108r90a","no_follow":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/108r90a\/looking_to_rebind_the_system_button_on_the_index\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1676242715,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hi so, I've been using programs like OpenVRtoKey for things such as OBS screenshots while playing VR games.

For months now, my left controller seemingly pretty randomly loses tracking for fractions of a second (does NOT fly off though). Sometimes it disconnects entirely. Very rarely the right controller disconnects as well, but it's 99% the left. \n\nI've tried everything I can think of, and all the suggestions I find online:\n\n* Removed all reflections (this has happened in 3 different rooms, one of those being in a different apartment)\n* Tried all the USB ports, including unplugging everything unnecessary\n* Used a PCIe USB card (tried two different ones, one of which is the famous Inatek one)\n* Redone room setup (many times)\n* Changed the way I'm facing 90\/180 degrees (to check whether it's a base station issue)\n* Reinstalled windows (fresh) 3 times, the latest being Windows 11\n* Recalibrated the IMU in the headset\n* Unpaired controllers and repaired them\n* Tried a different set of Index Controllers (same issue)\n* Unplugged my monitor while playing\n* Checked it's not performance related (I get consistent 90fps, and there are no spikes in the performance graph when it happens)\n* Tried many different versions of my graphics drivers\n\nMy steamvr log (as seen below), based on all the other posts like [this one](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/d83b24\/random_total_loss_of_tracking\/), suggest it's a USB bandwidth issue, but using a PCIe USB card has not fixed anything for me.\n\nAs you can see in the log, it has many \"Unexpected sample before sync\", and \"Triggered keepalive\" entries, which I assume is related to the issue.\n\nCouple notes:\n\n* I don't believe it's related to \"IMU went off scale\", because that also happens to my right controller and it's not correlated to the loss of tracking\n* Not every entry of \"Triggered keepalive\" results in a noticeable tracking loss, I believe some instances are too short to notice\n\nEDIT: Stuff I forgot to mention:\n\n* The loss of tracking is most noticeable when playing fast\/intense Beat Saber maps, likely because the small dropouts that might not be noticeable on slow maps are suddenly noticeable\n* There was a time when I seemingly didn't have this issue, however it *might* be just that I got better at beat saber and started playing faster maps (and therefore noticed the problem)\n* I tested with vanilla beat saber (no mods)\n* The only thing I haven't tried is a different computer, but that's a bit tricky\n\nSo, I plead, does anyone have any other ideas I can try?\n\nSome system specs: i7 6700K, AMD 5700XT, 32GB RAM. Mobo is AsRock z170 K6+ Fatality\n\nHere's my log from a 20-25min session (EDIT: truncated due to post length limit).

possible I would like your help troubleshoot my Valve Index I just got. I enjoyed playing on it for a day until the next day it was not detected. **I brought it to my work, and it is detected instantly on the work PCs I try.** \n\nMost or all things below I tried on **every usb port**, and also tried in Ubuntu 20.04 as I have it installed on a separate drive with a separate steam\/steamvr installation. **I have same issue in Ubuntu as in Windows,** so I wonder if it is the famous USB issue.   \n\n\n**What I've tried:** \n\n* restarting the PC and swapping USB ports between each restart. Every other peripheral disconnected except a simple keyboard. Also between each computer restart I restarted the headset by disconnecting the usb and power cable from the computer and headset.\n* disconnecting and reconnecting the headset - at the breakaway connector, at the power cord, at the USB\/DisplayPort connectors, and at the headset itself.\n* using \"Remove all SteamVR USB devices\" in SteamVR developer settings.\n* Using the USBDEVIEW tool that remove old USB device records from Windows.

Mixer](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1844610\/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_Vive_and_Index\/), the app that mixes part of your real word into the VR world, has been updated with a much requested feature: **Profiles** and **auto-activation**.\n\nYou can create different profiles for different use cases such as:\n\n* Seated games where you sit at your desktop.\n* *SimRacing* where you have a mixed reality cockpit showing the real racing wheel and the insides of your real cockpit.\n* *Flightsims* to see the real HOTAS.\n* Couch experiences such as *BigScreen* so you can easily grab a drink or use a real keyboard using *LapViewer*.\n* Room-scale games where you want to keep an eye on a real object in the room or use the *FloorViewer*.\n* For streamers, setup a profile with a box around a streamdeck.\n\nA profile can contain up to eight **Camera Boxes, Cockpits, Floor and\/or Lap Viewers**.\n\nProfiles can be auto-activated when the app detects your run a specific game\/app. E.g. configure it to activate the BigScreen profile when you start BigScreen, so you won't see the camera boxes around the HOTAS on your desk, because those are in another profile.\n\n**Tip**: Setup an empty profile and make that the default auto-activation profile. Then games you have not added to a profile will not show any camera boxes. This can be useful if you only use Reality Mixer for the cockpit feature during Simracing, or only for DJing in VR Chat, etc.\n\nBTW, you can signup for emails about new features, betas, discounts, price change announcements and other news about VR apps by Reality Inside.  \nSignup [here](http:\/\/eepurl.com\/hqp44v).\n\n[https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/games\/1844610\/announcements\/detail\/3406427820515008487](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/games\/1844610\/announcements\/detail\/3406427820515008487)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79844,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/a.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/TStS1K_XoxXdipffWfyt9kU5HY78IQhtmcxfCKJ7dH0.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Reality Mixer Update: Profiles and auto-activation based on current VR game\/app","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.81,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/w668g6\/reality_mixer_update_profiles_and_autoactivation\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Raivr","author_created_utc":1494247520,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_m2mvl4","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1656689555,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vp3lxx","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Self-Promotion (Developer)"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d046496e-81d3-11e9-a922-0e20483cc8ba","link_flair_text":"Self-Promotion (Developer)","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_metadata":{"pjjo41u07z891":{"e":"Image","id":"pjjo41u07z891","m":"image\/png","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pjjo41u07z891.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aff347db410cd2b0cc0ed0de215e90bad325eabe","x":108,"y":60},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pjjo41u07z891.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4822f35b2d652b7e12c80574016328dfae7041ae","x":216,"y":121},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pjjo41u07z891.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfc1db3f1861986e21532fa541c98fc1157f8e93","x":320,"y":180},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pjjo41u07z891.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5404a6a28890eb2574e0573cf42898813064e949","x":640,"y":360}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pjjo41u07z891.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c75911f5511f28184a2f3f1cb07219cbb1ca76","x":800,"y":450},"status":"valid"}},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vp3lxx","no_follow":false,"num_comments":0,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vp3lxx\/reality_mixer_update_camera_box_activation_by_vr\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"ynUYA37tEfMa171wU0iVQTs8PwtMq6WnuhVnVyW5spo","resolutions":[{"height":61,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/lSLHSMFt1B-GesAbvE1fV7Nnv4O_KT-Q7dFe7YTN5JU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0201723401f6e78fe916e33f5bdd1b4ff6e6052","width":108},{"height":123,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/lSLHSMFt1B-GesAbvE1fV7Nnv4O_KT-Q7dFe7YTN5JU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=451034508ef096641d171fe90c90ffaa2ce34aa3","width":216},{"height":183,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/lSLHSMFt1B-GesAbvE1fV7Nnv4O_KT-Q7dFe7YTN5JU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54e6642728e892cb0dcac2c4611cfef94c1abf3e","width":320}],"source":{"height":353,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/lSLHSMFt1B-GesAbvE1fV7Nnv4O_KT-Q7dFe7YTN5JU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=96fe7bcdeb3717f297eac9bb52aa5db9af7cf360","width":616},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1660052106,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Reality Mixer.

Select a different, or the same, button for several camera boxes, the floor viewer, the lap viewer or cockpit. (This is in addition to the button activation using a keyboard, joystick or racing wheel button.)\n* ***Leash***: When editing the camera boxes a 'leash', or line, is shown from the *Box Edit Panel* to the selected box. This makes it easier to find boxes and to see which one you're currently editing on the Edit Panel.\n* The *Box Edit Panel* does not fade out anymore when resizing or moving boxes. Instead, it will show a 'panel is disabled' screen.\n* You can now click anywhere on the background of the panel to move\/drag it through the world.\n* Brightness and contrast sliders are a bit less sensitive.\n* User can turn on\/off keyboard editing of boxes (for move\/rotate\/size).\n* A different method for calculating a RoomID is now used, preventing lots of settings .xml files on certain systems.  \n \n* Tip: Use **Voice Attack** to show and hide boxes by **speaking commands** such as \"**Show keyboard**\", \"Show HOTAS\", \"Show drinks\", \"Show couch\", \"Show desk\", etc.  \nConfigure Voice Attack to press the same keyboard button as you have configured with \"Activate by button\" in the Box Edit Panel.\n\nIf you have any questions, remarks or ideas, please share.\n\n

was lucky to be gifted a Valve Index in 2019, I've spent roughly 8+ hours a day every day using the kit, it is part of my treatment and thus very important, its a life line (will always be grateful to valve for giving it to me). I also have a bHaptic vest and Tundra trackers.\n\nI started with 2 base stations, then 3 and now  4.\n\nMy room in which I do VR and stream is my living room, I have about 2.5m by 1.8m of usable space.\n\nMy tether is in a pulley system and my Index is always connected.\n\nMy Base stations never go to sleep and always in On mode.\n\n(Two lighthouses I had diagonal corners on light stands)\n\n(Three lighthouses I had in a triangle formation)\n\n(Four in the four corners of the room)\n\nOver the years I have come across 2 main types of issue that effect tracking.\n\n1)Room related.\n\nMirrors, Monitors, TV, Pictures on walls, Windows.\n\nReflection is obvious but also I saw occlusion from my old central lamp shade.\n\nEasy to diagnose and avoid, I keep my curtains closed, I have a blanket to over my big TV and so on.\n\n2)Hardware related\n\nIf you discount faulty light houses or controllers and so on.\n\nThis one was different and harder to diagnose over the years and I believe it comes down to the hardware of your PC USB resources Bluetooth resources.\n\nNearly everything we connect to a PC these days is Bluetooth or USB, and you can get some really crappy chipsets or they just skimp on things.\n\nFor example my current gaming setup is a laptop now a lot of people won't touch a gaming laptop but after research I found it fit me perfectly.\n\nThe CPU was fine an AMD 5800h  8 core 16 threads, memory was fine 32gb of fast memory, storage was 2TB M2 fast storage and the graphics card was a 3070RTX with a TDP of 141w It pretty much plays everything  on ultra but.\n\nWith VR I was seeing glitches and tracking issues and after Valve sent me a 4th Lighthouse (long term loan) so we could look into it more and rule out any occlusion issues.\n\nIt was only showing up in games like SkyrimVr or VRchat where your hand might be still for awhile or move, Twitches would occur and other things.\n\nIn the end it came down to USB resources on the laptop, the solution is simple if I want 100% tracking with no glitches at all and an 8 hour play through (Full body tracking included) I remove my streaming camera, my external keyboard and mouse, my dogcam, my usb hubs.  (I now do this automatically when using VR.\n\nAnd at that point no glitches or issues in VR.\n\nThis problem can happen on Desktop PC's but shows up more on a laptop because you can't just put an extra USB card into a spare slot and USB hubs can cause interference and resources are more limited.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":79074,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"My light house experiences. with glitches and my work around.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.64,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vke5lh\/my_light_house_experiences_with_glitches_and_my\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"hm_yes__bread","author_created_utc":1638845004,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_haua1dso","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1655778507,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vh2ic6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vh2ic6","no_follow":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/vh2ic6\/gestures_with_knuckles_as_keyboard_inputs\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657107707,"retrieved_utc":1657107707,"score":8,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Title says it all.

Using an activation delay means you have to look at the object for a second before it starts to show itself, to prevent accidental activation.\n* Activate by ***Button Press***: Press a keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS or racing wheel button to turn on\/off a camera box.\n* ***Floor Viewer***: To quickly see the real floor around your feet.\n* ***Lap Viewer***: For use with seated experiences such as Big Screen. Lap Viewer can be used for quick glances at a normal (untracked) keyboard on your lap.\n* Slider for camera brightness adjustment.\n* Slider for camera contrast adjustment.\n* Toggle for using transparency instead of static (white noise) for areas the camera can't see.\n\n*Floor Viewer* and *Lap Viewer* both use Gaze Angle Activation by default, but could use Proximity or ButtonPress activation as well.\n\nIf you have any questions, remarks or ideas, please

symptoms are pretty much identical to what I've seen on this sub *many* times: after not using the Index for some time, the headset is suddenly not being detected when plugged in, and SteamVR shows error **108: \"Headset not detected\"**. The lights on the headset are blue, and in the device manager, it shows up only as ***eTronVideo*** 3D camera, ***Generic SuperSpeed USB Hub***, and ***USB Composite Device***. The camera itself is working and can be used as a webcam, the headset display does show my desktop when Direct Mode is disabled in SteamVR.\n\nFrom what I've seen in previous posts about this issue, what usually helps if nothing else does is replacing the tether cable - except I'm fairly sure that's not it in my case, as the headset is **detected correctly on another PC** (with USB 3.1 ports).\n\n**My PC specs:**\n\n- Motherboard: MSI MPG x570 GAMING PLUS\n- CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X\n- GPU: Gigabyte RTX 2070\n- RAM: ADATA XPG Gammix D10 (8+8+16+16)\n- Keyboard: Razer Cynosa Chroma\n- Mouse: Logitech MX Master 3\n- System: Windows 10 Pro, version 21H1\n\n**What I've tried:**\n\n- restarting the PC\n- completely powering off the PC and removing the power cable (plugging it back afterwards, of course)\n- disconnecting and reconnecting the headset - at the breakaway connector, at the power cord, at the USB\/DisplayPort connectors, and at the headset itself\n- switching to different USB ports\n- using \"Remove all SteamVR USB devices\" in SteamVR developer settings\n- uninstalling the devices using USBDeview [\\(as described here\\)](https:\/\/help.steampowered.com\/en\/wizard\/HelpRequest\/HT-4M2Y-H23K-B5K6)\n- updating graphics drivers\n- updating BIOS (fun story, by the way - apparently, BIOSes using AMD ComboAm4v2PI 1-2-0-5 or newer don't exactly work well with more than 16 GB RAM)\n- disabling power management for USB controllers (and devices)\n- disabling USB selective suspend\n- disabling PCIe 4.0 and Global C-State in BIOS\n- **installing Linux and trying out SteamVR there** - exact same issue, the headset only shows up as *Bus 008 Device 004: ID 28de:2400 Valve Software 3D Camera* and *Bus 008 Device 003: ID 0424:5744 Microchip Technology, Inc. (formerly SMSC) Hub*\n- uninstalling Razer Synapse\n- using the USB-C port in the graphics card (through an Anker hub)\n\n**What did help (momentarily):**\n\nAs suggested by Steam Support, I have:\n  1. Unplugged *all* USB devices\n  2. Plugged in the Index USB and DisplayPort connectors\n  3. Unplugged and re-plugged the breakaway connector\nThis made the headset show up correctly as Index Radio and Index HMD, and it worked fine with SteamVR... until I unplugged the breakaway connector once more. Repeating these steps with one of the other USB ports made it show up again, and disconnecting it made the issue come back *again*. Since then, this does not work with *any* of the USB ports.\n\nThe headset is also being detected when I plug it into the USB 2.0 ports **on the front panel** instead of the back ones, even after disconnecting and reconnecting it a couple times... but usually only until I plug it back into one of the back USB ports - after that, it doesn't work with the front ones, either, until I restart the PC. Technically, that could be a workaround, but the cable is too short to reach DisplayPort when plugged in there. What's interesting, in the USB 2.0 ports on the back panel, it is not detected *at all*, not even as the camera.\n\n**So... any ideas?**\n\nI have written to the Steam Support, but they didn't come up with anything yet.\nI don't think it's the cable or the headset at fault here, since they work with another PC; I don't think it's something with the leftover devices or drivers, since it still does not work on a fresh Linux installation on the same machine (unless, for example, the keyboard conflicts with the headset on both systems?). My main suspect would be the motherboard itself, but everything was fine for months, until now. At this point, I'm really not sure what to think - any help would be appreciated!","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78110,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Headset not detected (108) - probably not the cable at fault?","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.57,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/ul1syq\/headset_not_detected_108_probably_not_the_cable\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Proud-Worth2907","author_created_utc":1648555554,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_l9uqzs7z","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1649663422,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"u12c6k","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Impressions\/Review"}],"link_flair_template_id":"35fbd75e-33a6-11ea-9a52-0e4ad9ac2da5","link_flair_text":"Impressions\/Review","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_u12c6k","no_follow":false,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/u12c6k\/my_experience_of_sim_racers_pimax_8k_x_vr_headset\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654012568,"retrieved_utc":1654012568,"score":4,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":" SO the first thing I notice 8kx is that is quiet large and  bulky weight in at 860  grams as opposed to  the 550 grams i used to with the reverb g2 ,so it considerably more heavy and it will be interresting  to see how that  goes in termd of the weight the face and whether if  becomes  uncomfortbale  after a short of time ,i found g2 was able to drive for  40 minutes  before I started  to get a headache eye  strain and just sort of  start  to feel uncomfortable with it uh you know some people are able to go  a lot longer than that really just depends on wether  you have  motion sickness. or wether if  you know  just  i  guess  sruggle with  claustropgbia in general but 8kx does have  a  quite comfortable looking head straps so we can release the velcro and tighten up and  down ,and then we can got  o sort of  hinging  mechanism like  which allows you to put the headset on and pop it down  but it does not  allow you to flick the headseat  up easily  when it's sitting on your heads  and see what was going on the screen and find keyboard was and it is very comfortable on my head. \n\n  Other interesting here as well as i do have  the optionl dmas headphones to make contact ear or be like  a cup system . \n\n It called 8kx which  sorts of leads  you to believe  that it's an 8k resolution is 76.8 4320 pixels so here is a horizontal resolution  across  both eyes of 7680 but also have a vertical resolution of 2160. so clear  it is absolutly perfect pixel and a lot of immersion what  Im doing .\n\n In  terms of field of view  entire preipheral vision 190 degree to 230 and distorsion is really better than  i expected be able to do withot  kind of blurring, i am not getting any chromatic  aberation ethier so i am not getting any  sort of color splitting  which I am really  impressed by  sth that  i  have struggle  with some other vr headsets.

(If you don't know *Reality Mixer*, please see links to my earlier posts at the bottom.)\n\nThis update brings the following changes:\n\n* **Attach to tracked devices**: A camera box can be anchored to a tracked device such as a **controller, headset or Vive or Tundra tracker**. If the tracked device is attached to e.g. a (real) wireless keyboard, you can move the keyboard through your play area and see it when you look at it. Attach a tracker to a swivel chair with wheels and take the chair with you in VR.\n* **Edit box edges**: Reduce brightness of the sparkling edges or turn off the edges completely. Increase width of the edges, which is also used for smooth fade-ins when using a **Cockpit** Box.\n* **Min\/max transparency** of boxes: If you set the maximum opacity of a box to e.g. 50%, you'll see the VR world pass through the camera box or cockpit, increasing the feeling of reality. Great for **Simracing** and Flightsim experiences using **racing wheels** or HOTAS.\n* Move\/drag Box Edit Panel: When editing camera boxes, you can now position the panel yourself by dragging it. Use the icon in the top left corner to move the panel.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please let me know here or on the [Steam Forum](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1844610\/view\/3119312563812829516).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLinks to my earlier posts about *Reality Mixer*:\n\nPost 2 : \"[Reality Mixer Update: Create Cockpit + Keyboard Control](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/tcrj5c\/reality_mixer_update_create_cockpit_keyboard\/)\"\n\nPost 1 : \"[Finally, a good use for the Vive and Index cameras](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/virtualreality\/comments\/stzzwf\/finally_a_good_use_for_the_vive_and_index_cameras\/)\"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78129,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/4hP9RQBGOzhF5VJEeDl6ssVkwagscOIuQW4Xqp4WRnw.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Reality Mixer Update -

You will see your hands and arms from the corner of your eyes while racing. This makes the racing experience more real, while also allowing you to get refreshments while driving.   \nClick the button \"Create Cockpit\" on the dashboard page to create a cockpit at the current headset position. You can move, rotate and resize the cockpit using VR controllers or keyboard.\n* **Keyboard Control**: You can now use the keyboard for moving and resizing the cockpit box and other camera boxes. If you only have a headset, without controllers, you can now use this app as well.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please reply here or on the [Steam Community](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1844610\/view\/3124940799694086449) forum.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78151,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/jsRKb3ZeocIXO0u08n9ESxOlcI8Spxau5FMX6lHNhoE.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Reality Mixer Update: Create Cockpit + Keyboard Control","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/tcre0v\/reality_mixer_update_create_cockpit_keyboard\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"Obscerno","author_created_utc":1382134020,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_dkc4h","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1645767835,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"t0wamn","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_t0wamn","no_follow":false,"num_comments":2,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/t0wamn\/any_progress_on_the_desktop_keyboard_front\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654097250,"retrieved_utc":1654097250,"score":2,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I've started using OVR Toolkit to get a keyboard I can type on using both hands and that has the other keys that Steam VR excludes.

If you want to use a PC keyboard in VR, it will use the camera only when you look at the keyboard, not when you are looking the other way or if you are at the other end of your play space.\n\nYou can bring several objects into VR in a non-intrusive way. The objects will fade out and disappear when you are not nearby.  \nImagine how useful it is to see your desk in VR, or a chair, a couch or the doorway. It works with **all SteamVR games**.  \nIf you like **SIM racing**, how about seeing your real **racing wheel** in VR, or a **HOTAS**.  \nIf you do streaming from VR, you can use the app to see an **Elgato Stream Deck** or Touch Portal in your VR world.\n\nThe app is currently in *Early Access* on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1844610\/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_Vive_and_Index\/). This means it is available now, while it is developed further.\n\nSome new features that will be implemented include:\n\n* Green screening \/ chroma keying. E.g. put a green screen behind the racing wheel or HOTAS to hide the area surrounding the wheel or HOTAS.\n* Attach an object to a Vive or Tundra Tracker to move a pocket of reality through the VR world. E.g. attach a tracker to a wireless keyboard to use and see it in VR while sitting on a couch.\n\nIf you have ideas for additional features, please reach out.\n\nTake a look at the [Steam page here](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1844610\/Reality_Mixer__Mixed_Reality_for_Vive_and_Index\/).\n\nOr watch the short intro on [YouTube](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Bqvm4D2PP18).","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78211,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/yoH5zqvhfpHnQlW_zjFvmDXpgcmUVLDxut3IeqVEa8Q.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Finally, a good use for the camera","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.98,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/stznea\/finally_a_good_use_for_the_camera\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"MeAgainstTheWrld","author_created_utc":1577243028,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_3v4qdni3","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1644995217,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"stpno5","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_stpno5","no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/stpno5\/mouse_stops_working_after_launching_steamvr\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1654114434,"retrieved_utc":1654114434,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Every time I launch steamvr my mouse is frozen on my monitor.

I am hoping to buy a nice VR headset, as that was one of my main reasons for buying my PC.  The landscape has totally changed since I last had interest in VR, so I need some advice on which system to purchase.  I'm heading off to college after graduation in May, so space will be a factor in my dorm as well, although I should have enough room to stand up and wave my arms around and whatnot.  I'm mostly torn between the HP Reverb G2 and the valve index, but any other VR headsets that fall within my general price range and fit my PC requirements would be welcome news!  Resolution is an important factor but most importantly, I need to have good tracking on the headset and controllers.  I currently have a PSVR and the tracking is very underwhelming.  I also need the headset to be compatible with my pc and able to run at decent graphics and decent frame rate.  I would prefer to not have to mount anything on my walls because it'll be in a dorm, but I can if I have to.  Im hoping to mostly play stuff like boneworks and tarkov, but racing games and pretty much everything is fair game for me too.

followed all the suggestions in the sidebar and linked FAQ**.   \n\nSearching has been a bit difficult (even with \"-\" limiters) because Assetto Corsa has a large, fanatical fan base --- most search results relate to setting up wheels, drifting, detailed customization, etc. We've never owned a driving game until now (unless GTA V counts).\n\nIt seems that we need to start the game directly from the desktop shortcut, without Steam VR running in the background, and add -VR to the Steam launch options. \n\nAs it opens, we get a warning message to the effect that because it\u2019s running in VR, it may not appear right. \n\nIt opens fine without VR enabled. We can go to a simple test track and the acceleration, brakes and steering work fine off the keyboard.   \n\nAfter changing the settings&gt;display to \u2018OpenVR\u2019, the game shows up in the headset \u2014 but the mouse and keyboard controls cut out. No amount of button mashing or fiddling with the Index\u2019s control sticks changes anything. We alt-tab out of the game and try again. \n\n\u2018Try again\u2019 means starting in different orders, trying with Steam VR in the background anyway or loading directly from the desktop after a clean reboot. No matter what we do, the result is the same. \n   \nAll drivers are up to date. The game is running on a standard user account. Malware Bytes is the only non-essential thing running in the background (Afterburner is installed but not running).   \n\nBesides the Index, the only things we have connected are the USB keyboard and mouse (both wireless) and an external USB drive enclosure. The drive is mapped\/assigned a letter under Windows; the game is located on it, installed via Steam\u2019s \u2018create a new library\u2019 option. No other games have problems running on this drive. \n\nSome \u2018advice\u2019 I\u2019ve found is to just buy a steering wheel. But other than GTA, we don\u2019t have any other driving games. For the time being, we just want to experience as many genres as we can on the Index and want to use either the keyboard or the Index controllers. \n\nIf this game won\u2019t run (or is too complicated for light fun), feel free to recommend an alternative that will show off the Index. \n\nOh, if it makes a difference, the machine has a Ryzen 5 3600 and a 5700 XT. All other Steam games and VR titles we've tried (e.g. Alyx, Star Wars Squadron, Boneworks) run beautifully. \n\nThanks~","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/ValveIndex","subreddit_subscribers":78260,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Assetto Corsa works fine in Windows, but when VR is enabled the headset is fine but the mouse\/keyboard controls stop working.","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":1.0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/rrb3zr\/assetto_corsa_works_fine_in_windows_but_when_vr\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"EMB3R14","author_created_utc":1517292684,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_uivfoeq","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1639999847,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.ValveIndex","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"rkl9rj","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#005c7c","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question\/Support"}],"link_flair_template_id":"d716a02c-81d3-11e9-8408-0e2cf56a4026","link_flair_text":"Question\/Support","link_flair_text_color":"light","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_metadata":{"z9ki9vo9lo681":{"e":"Image","id":"z9ki9vo9lo681","m":"image\/jpg","p":[{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a239db505f25b1c410022527b1ab7461904b344","x":108,"y":108},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcb03ab588100b4548732835d8d373f81dd19b85","x":216,"y":216},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0970abbdbdd1ee862360cdfd45da1a9c28afd180","x":320,"y":320},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcae8a1a1a7db73cd6d7cf31df8bbb8bf02b143e","x":640,"y":640},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256c66b1053e3bbe25af9d37201952a3919a7f0c","x":960,"y":960},{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52da4068eac14fdb7482cdca5367eb48f274364f","x":1080,"y":1080}],"s":{"u":"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/z9ki9vo9lo681.jpg?width=1137&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c12c0c6e38906adad24ba9e80039756f1a257707","x":1137,"y":1137},"status":"valid"}},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_rkl9rj","no_follow":false,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/rkl9rj\/tracking_issuesfirmware_reset_controllers\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1656064476,"retrieved_utc":1656064476,"score":6,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I have been having major tracking issues after RMA'ing my Index controllers and HMD, and making my playspace larger by 1m in one direction.

Companies envision this world to be one where most people will live most of the most meaningful parts of their life in the future.\n\n# 1. The Metaverse is not possible with mouse and keyboard\n\nAs Metaverse enthusiasts, it's important to remember that we are likely the top 0.1% of computer users. Most people are confused by technology, overwhelmed by options and worried if they push the wrong button they will destroy something.\n\nChrome added a copy and paste feature to the menu because [people couldn't discover](https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/technology\/only-one-in-10-know-what-ctrlf-does--here-are-shortcuts-you-should-know-20111130-1o69d.html) how to copy and paste.\n\nSince the Metaverse simulates the countless possibilities of physical life, the complexity of the user interface gets out of hand quickly.\n\nI remember testing out Second Life and accidentally taking off my pants and being unable to put them back on for 20 minutes.\n\nClearly, mouse and keyboard would not be a sufficient way of interacting with the metaverse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 2. No significant social organization arises out of putting people in a virtual space\n\n18 years ago, Second Life came out and the hype around the Metaverse future was just as real back then as it is today. You can visit the empty government buildings, brand showcases and  cities to get a taste of the forgotten glory.\n\nTime and time again people have been put together in a virtual space, and we still went back to physical life for real connections.\n\nWe have to ask ourselves, why did we leave virtual worlds and go back to physical life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3. The nature of virtual spaces leads to shallow relationships\n\nThe great benefits of any relationship are usually found in the most challenging operations of cooperation, marriage is a great example. Dating is exciting but sharing a life with someone is deeply sacrificial and yet, the benefits of marriage are enormous.\n\nIn  digital worlds we scarcely invest as heavily in relationships as in physical life. When we can go anywhere, be with anyone it's easy to constantly look for greener grass.\n\nThis problem is accentuated by the ability to change your name\/avatar at will. When people can burn others and simply change their identity to escape consequences, they do. Investing in a real reputation and a single identity is the first step to solving this issue.\n\n# \n\n# 4. The Metaverse will arise from a gaming world\n\nIn digital worlds, we find ourselves mixed in with people from different cultures who have different values and interests. By contrast, in physical life we are naturally segmented with people who are more likely to share our values and ideas.\n\nGaming has the power to break ice between people and therefore has intrinsic utility to the Metaverse.\n\nBy using gamification we can organize and connect people of similar interests and values in a virtual space.\n\nNot only that, gaming has the power to get people to relax. Human beings don\u2019t develop meaningful friendships when forced into it. This is what social games and \u201cvirtual life\u201d games often get wrong. Actual gameplay builds the context we need to relax and have a conversation to find people we are compatible with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 5. Reciprocating facial expressions are necessary for cooperative human behavior\n\nIf you've ever lifted a baby and smiled at it, you know that facial expressions are deeply embedded in how we communicate. When we hurt someone's feelings, their facial expressions changes and, as we reciprocate their facial expressions, our body produces the same emotions as we make that individual feel. This acts as a natural tempering of our behaviour that we don't get when we communicate over the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 6. The network effect would eventually push everyone to a single virtual world\n\nA long time ago, there was a single company that dominated the telephone market. To call anybody who was the customer of the company you needed to have a phone that was with that same company, phones were not interoperable. Today, if you want to contact somebody on Facebook, you need Facebook to do so. This is how social networks defend their intellectual property.\n\nMeta executive Jason Rubin:\n\n\u201cThe first metaverse that gains real traction is likely to the be the last,\u201d Rubin wrote. \u201cWe must act first, and go big, or we risk being one of those wannabes.\u201d - [CNBC](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/10\/30\/facebooks-meta-mission-was-laid-out-in-a-2018-paper-on-the-metaverse.html)\n\nThe network effect is a scary prospect because it means that there will likely be only one Metaverse to rule them all in the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 7. Customization is the enemy of usability\n\nIt's fascinating to bump into so many people who share the idea that no corporation should control the future of human interaction. However, it's laughable that we're using the same ill-advised ideas that allowed Facebook, Google and apps to dominate when it comes to this next chapter.\n\nOne of the reasons that Facebook overtook MySpace was that MySpace allowed people to customize their profile infinitely. This led to a myriad of different user interfaces, confusing navigation and a poor user experience.\n\nJust imagine a myriad of virtual worlds all with their own user interface, controls and standards. The experience of travelling from world to world would be like being born all over again and having to learn how to read and write.\n\nTherefore, the virtual world must have a single user experience to reach mass adoption.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 8. The Metaverse has the power to become a dystopian nightmare\n\nAs the network effect brings everyone to a single Metaverse, the potential for the abuse of power will be astronomical. The Metaverse will understand where you are, who you are with and even what you look at.\n\nAI will be able to process that data to better understand you than you yourself and data is the first step toward oppression.\n\nUtilizing all this data, powerful individuals will have the ability to suppress dissent, identify people of contrarian opinion etc.\n\nMoreover, if we begin to fool ourselves that we can agree on morals and values, those who [disagree with the mainstream](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tyranny_of_the_majority) will live in constant fear of losing their friends, job and opportunities if they are banned from the Metaverse.\n\nP.S.

hi there.  \nIs this application still relevant? Heck if I know. Didn't stop me from working on it.  \nThis version is one that was kinda never supposed to be released, but it's been almost 8 months since the last stable release, so bundling up all the small beta changes once again makes sense, I suppose.\n\nFor those who need an introduction to the app:  \nDesktop+ is a free desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.  \nSteamVR's built-in desktop overlay has gotten better at this stuff somewhat, but I believe Desktop+ still has a place for those who need a bit more from their overlays.\n\nAs for why this version was never supposed to be released, more about that at the end.\n\nFirst, here's what's new in Desktop+ 2.6:\n\n**New:**  \n\n- Added Seated Position overlay origin  \nThis origin follows the seated tracking universe position and adjusts overlays automatically when the seated position changes. Keep in mind this is only useful when running applications using the seated tracking space (not to be confused with the standing-only position).  \nWhen the standing tracking space is active, SteamVR may move the seated position in an inconvenient spot, so make sure to configure overlays while the seated tracking space is active.\n- Added Gaze Fade target opacity setting  \nThis setting controls the opacity it fades towards. If this is set higher than the overlay's opacity, it inverts the Gaze Fade behavior (fading in when looking away).\n- Added separate maximum distance setting for Global HMD-Pointer\n- Horizontal stick\/touchpad scroll input during overlay drag now adjusts the width of the overlay\n- The yellow border around desktops and windows when using Graphics Capture is now disabled if supported (requires Windows 11)\n- Performance Monitor now displays headset battery levels if available\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Improved accuracy of the Performance Monitor FPS counter and enabled FPS display while no VR application is running\n- Improved input simulation compatibility with games using DirectInput for keyboard input (e.g. Skyrim)\n- Increased Floating UI fade-out delay &amp; doubled it for curved overlays\n- Controllers can no longer toggle overlay interaction if they're used as the overlay's origin\n- Window overlay focus changes are no longer triggered while drag or select mode is active\n- A non-Steam restart of Desktop+ is now attempted when the Steam restart failed\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fixed CPU &amp; GPU performance counters not working in desktop mode\n- Fixed FPS being displayed as 0 in Performance Monitor when only reprojected frames are shown\n- Fixed toggling drag-mode desyncing current overlay state between UI and main process\n- Fixed race condition when adding several Graphics Capture overlays at once (on startup or by loading a profile)\n- Fixed UI dimming setting not being saved and restored correctly\n- Fixed wrong icon variant being used in some places for the combined desktop overlay icon\n- Fixed Global HMD-Pointer not switching between overlays unless there was a gap between them\n- Fixed Global HMD-Pointer desyncing current overlay state between UI and main process\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/5521971008767625720).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).\n\n**Progress on the new UI**\n\nI've seemingly always promised to tackle usability concerns at some point, so I've been busy actually fulfilling that promise. The original plan was to drop it all in one big release... but it turned out to take way longer than anticipated. Oh well.  \nHowever, progress has been made over time and I've been quietly releasing preview builds on Steam and GitHub without making a big deal out them over here. With the NewUI Preview 3 build I think it's gotten to the point of at least being worth mentioning, though.  \nWhile obviously not stable, I consider NewUI Preview 3 to have a decent amount of features now. Good enough for daily use if one's fine with some stuff still missing.\n\nAnd the new UI is not just the same thing in green either, it comes with its own set of new stuff alongside making the old work better:\n\n- Floating settings windows (can be moved anywhere and pinned to use outside of dashboard)\n- Translation support (currently ships with English &amp; German)\n- Fully custom keyboard (layouts are user-definable, currently ships with US-QWERTY &amp; German QWERTZ, also improved input simulation)\n- Custom laser pointer (non-blocking input outside of dashboard, multi-laser input on keyboard)\n- Overlay Bar (better overlay management)\n- Window listing\/management improvements (window state tracking, auto-hiding\/restoration)\n- Better overlay creation (directly select source, drag window out of desktop overlay, get active window from Floating UI)\n- Auto-docking\n- Better Floating UI design (works with any curvature setting)\n- ...and more, probably\n\nThe announcement posts for each New UI Preview build comes with more details, including small video clips, if you want to know more: [Preview 1](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/2984183718087120350), [Preview 2](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/2888485959670010355), [Preview 3](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/5521971008786221043).  \nThis is where my focus has been on recently, so I hope you at least check the clips out.

In a nutshell, it allows users to search, preview the products in their real world scale and in 3D, interact with some of them and finally make orders.\n\nThe goal of this application is to assess the potential of such idea as the next step in online shopping evolution.

Unbelievable. Along the line of some update or another it must have messed up between steam, the pc and the headset. \nI\u2019ll carefully monitor what I download and update to see if it affect my headset. \n\n\nEDIT; Posting a list of things I have tried and haven\u2019t worked so far. \n\nSteam related I have started steam using admin permissions, done the thing in steam where you remove all known usb devices, I\u2019ve switched to steam beta, contacted support and did every other suggestion they had including uninstalling and reinstalling stream vr, hell I even uninstalled and reinstalled steam itself to no avail. \n\nI\u2019ve updated my graphics card, my audio driver (which could have been an issue, I will rule this as a factor or not later), uninstalled and updated all my USB ports using a program suggested called driver support. \nBefore I updated my audio driver I reset my whole computer to an out of the box state in order to try and fix a crackling issue I had when playing games in vr, all my audio coming thru my headset at the time was very staticky and would get worse. And it wasn\u2019t exclusive to the headset itself. It would do it in my headphones or even my speakers. Until I updated the Realtek audio driver nothing worked. UNLESS and only SOMETIMES if I started my computer up at the time with my external mic unplugged from the usb it would be okay without static. And I say sometimes because my computer would be fine until I would have more than two applications running then it would begin to crackle. \n\nSo that issue was fixed and I\u2019m sure I used my headset between that Realtek update and the period of time when I took a break from vr games due to starting college. When I came back, started steam vr and it gave me a 108 error with the last headset I had, fast forward to now I have a brand new RMA headset from steam, my computer DOES recognize it, I can see it plugged in with my other razer mouse and keyboard. But I\u2019m back to square one with trying to solve the problem before I reset my computer completely in homes that fixes the issue. \n\nI\u2019ve read around on here and resetting to the out of the box state worked for some people but not everyone. With my audio driver issues and stuff in the past I\u2019ve finally updated and installed everything recommended to me and I\u2019d hate to have to do it again if there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing. \n\nI\u2019ll keep this updated if something works, I really appreciate any advise of pointers even if it\u2019s something I\u2019ve already tried.\n\n\nOriginal post;\nI\u2019m completely out of options\n\nI\u2019ve contacted steam, browsed Reddit, talked to friends who are more computer savvy than me. Nothing has worked. I\u2019ve updated, disabled, uninstalled and re installed about every option. From usbs, graphics card, windows, steam etc. I was fairly certain it was my old headset that was the issue\n\nYesterday I got a brand new headset from steam. Again, the same problem. So it\u2019s either my computer or steam?

When I plug my valve index into my PC, I believe it's the 108 error. That is when it's plugged into my motherboard directly. I bought an expansion card, and plugging my Valve Index into that makes it work however, it only works when plugged into the motherboard's PCIE X4 slot and not PCIE X1. This makes sense as it's some sort of bandwidth issue, but the issue with having it in the X4 slot is that it's right below the GPU PCIE slot, and I have a RTX 3080 FE card so if I have both installed, it blocks the bottom fan. \n\nI have a [ROG STRIX B550-F GAMING (WI-FI)](https:\/\/rog.asus.com\/uk\/motherboards\/rog-strix\/rog-strix-b550-f-gaming-wi-fi-model\/) updated with the latest BIOS. I just don't know why it doesn't work when plugged straight into my motherboard as I only have a keyboard, mouse and microphone plugged into it.

apologize in advance for the word vomit, but would really appreciate any insight or suggestions!\n\nHas anyone experienced any issues with one or both controllers floating away when using the Vive Lip Tracker? I've been experiencing this issue for a while, but recently it has gotten worse. At first I thought my controller was busted and actually purchased a new one. The new controller is experiencing the same issues. Then I thought it had to be a reflection, so I got like 6 blankets and covered EVERYTHING. Still issues. I finally was able to isolate it(I believe) to the Vive Lip Tracker. My controllers function completely normal when it's turned off, and one has drift issues if it's turned on. \n\nI'm using it with the Valve Index- which I realize is not officially supported. I've even plugged the Lip Tracker directly into my PC with a USB extender to test if somehow plugging it into the headset was an issue. Still problems. I  spoke to some else who uses to Vive Pro Eye and is having similar issues with the Lip Tracker...so that makes me think it's probably not incompatibility with the headset. \n\nI've tried a billion things to fix it and instead of more word vomit, I'll make a list.  \n\n\n1. Uninstall\/reinstall Steam VR.\n2. Unpair all USB devices through SteamVR menu and re-paired carefully\n3.

Unplugged all usb devices on my PC to just VR Headset, Keyboard, Mouse, Mic, and Lip Tracker\n5. Uninstalled Lip Tracker software and reinstalled\n6. Using only 2 lightboxes instead of 4\n7. Covering Lip Tracker IR light while on\n8. Experimenting with launching SteamVr with it plugged in or not \n9. Plugging headset into different USBs\n10. New controller.\n11. Covered everything with blankets incase it was reflections.\n\n\\*\\*Additional Note: It seems to happen mostly when my hand is down by my outer thigh and butt area.\n\nI received the Vive Lip Tracker in April 2021 and have been using it with LIV and several body trackers quite often. I  experienced occasional drifting issues during this time, but over the past couple weeks, it has gotten bad enough that I often can't pass a Beat Saber song due to a controller blasting off to the moon.

Please note that this may have been updated since, so if anyone can explain in detail more about reshader, please let others know anything else I've not mentioned in this thread.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have a GTX 1660 ti, mid-range graphics cards, and its made a big difference.  If you have a higher end card, you might be able to drop the quality after this for higher fps, but you can look into that later:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you want an example try checking out this screenshot from [Fallout 4](https:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/fallout4\/mods\/48934).  Try and look between screenshot 1 &amp; screenshot 2 for non-CAS and CAS differences (don't look at the left\/right eye sockets)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**Please note that since this is editing a game's files, it could count as a fake hack when playing online games (Like battleye) so I recommend not doing this for certain games that use programs like this to search for cheaters, keep it single player or casual multiplayer games**\n\n**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFirst you download this mod for VR Skyrim, don't worry it works for all VR available games that benefit from this (you will need to register, it's all good, I've done it before for Subnautica VR mod):\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nexusmods.com\/skyrimspecialedition\/mods\/46999\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen extract all the files in the zip in your root directory of your game file (where the exe is), so in your Steam folder find \"...Steam\/steamapps\/common\/GAMENAME\" and drop the files in there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt should be 4 files called \"reshade-shaders\" folder, \"Reshade\" &amp; \"Reshade Preset \"config setting, and \"dxgi.dll\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLoad up the game and it should be good to go!  If you're uncertain if its working, check the top left of your screen on your monitor and it should say the shader mod has been installed, or press the \"HOME\" button on your keyboard and check your monitor and it should bring up the reshader options screen.  Some VR headsets have \"monitor\" mode built into them, so you can check it this way instead of leaning over and removing your VR headset.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you ever want these features removed, just delete the four files (sometimes dxgi.dll creates a notepad file, you can delete that as well) and your game is back to normal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou can toggle the \"END\" key on your keyboard to turn off\/on the effects within the game if you need to see the differences yourself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere's my current game list that this works for, please feel free to add workable games to this.  If the game has (Win64) next to it, you may need to drop the 4 files into it's Win64 folder app instead to make it work.  Games marked with (+) are my personal favourite changes.

there!  \nSomehow it's been almost 2 months since the last release already. Even SteamVR now has window mirroring, as I've had predicted [4 months ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ValveIndex\/comments\/jr2tob\/steamvr_might_be_getting_builtin_window_mirroring\/) (took them a little, eh?).  \nI've not just been sitting idle either, though. The beta branch of Desktop+ has been getting updates every few weeks. Time to bundle things up since it's been long enough.\n\nFor those who need an introduction to the app:  \nDesktop+ is a free desktop and window overlay application for SteamVR. It allows you to bring your desktop into VR in various ways, monitor performance, simulate input from your VR controllers, and more.\n\nThis new stable build is more a collection of all the smaller additions and fixes that happened over time, rather than any single big new feature. Still, it's become quite the list.\n\nHere's what's new in Desktop+ 2.5:\n\n**New:**  \n\n- Added environment background color and UI dimming settings  \n  The environment background color setting allows to partially or fully cover the VR scene either only while looking at the Desktop+ dashboard tab or at all times. Primary intended use of this feature is creating a completely black void to use SteamVR overlays in.\n- Added \"Update when Invisible\" overlay setting  \n  This setting helps if you want third-party applications to be able to grab the overlay contents at any time (e.g. Stop Sign VR). Updates are still suspended when the overlay is disabled or hidden by display mode setting, however.  \n  To create an overlay meant to only display in a third-party app, make sure it's always visible and enabled, then set the opacity to 0% and disable input for it.\n- Added Global HMD-Pointer setting  \n  This setting allows using the HMD gaze to point at Desktop+ overlays while the dashboard is closed. Mostly useful to change focus, get the cursor to window overlays and then use the physical mouse to continue the interaction.\n- Added support for enabling UIAccess\n  UIAccess allows Desktop+ to access *all* windows, including UAC prompts, without running elevated itself. It essentially lifts most restrictions Desktop+ faces as a normal application.\n  Enabling UIAccess can be very convenient, but also means you trust Desktop+ with your system. Use your own judgement and read the documentation in the \"misc\" folder of Desktop+'s application directory on how to enable this feature.\n- Added automatic overlay naming  \n  Overlay names will now automatically change to match the selected source desktop\/window. Manual naming is still possible and unaffected by this. To go back from a manual name to an automatic one, leave the name blank.\n- Added icons to overlay and window lists\n- Added quick add button next to the overlay drop-down list\n- Added \"Set from Gaze\" auto-configuration button for Gaze Fade\n- Added option to disable GPU performance counters for the Performance Monitor  \n  This prevents GPU hardware monitoring related stutter with recent NVIDIA drivers.\n- Added cleanup script in the \"misc\" folder to revert system-wide changes made by scripts from there\n- Allow for smaller slider steps in UI desktop mode when holding shift\n- Floating UI now scales based on viewing distance\n\n**Changed:**  \n\n- Changed default Gaze Fade distance to infinite\n- Changed default overlay interaction auto-toggle distance to 0.30 m\n- Changed overlay curvature slider maximum range to 35% (higher values are still accessible through +\/- buttons or direct input)\n- Overlay width is now limited to 0.25 m when initially switching to controller origins\n- Names and icons of hidden overlays are now displayed half-transparent in the overlay list preview\n- Enabled all display modes for dashboard overlay origin\n- Current desktop mirror is no longer reset in single desktop mode when cropping to the same desktop as before\n- Performance counter queries are now only active while the Performance Monitor is visible\n- The VR keyboard now automatically switches to settings UI input when needed if the keyboard is already open for a Desktop+ overlay\n- Capture source windows are no longer auto-focused when HMD pointer override is active\n- It's now possible to directly select the same window source again to restart the capture if it had been lost before\n- Improved reliability of window focus changes\n- Improved scripts in the \"misc\" folder and related documentation\n- Improved Graphics Capture stability\n- Improved startup time\n\n**Fixed:**  \n\n- Improved hotkey compatibility with games using lower level keyboard APIs consuming hotkey presses (e.g. Project Cars 2)\n- Fixed simulating mouse input on the desktop when pointing at a Performance Monitor overlay\n- Fixed \"To HMD\" button not working correctly with overlays with tracked device origin\n- Fixed inaccurate width values by removing scaling from dashboard transform  \n  This is a semi-breaking change. Existing profiles' overlay width values will be adjusted automatically, but only for the active origin.  \n  Default overlay width has been adjusted to result in roughly the same size as before.\n- Fixed cursor not displaying for window overlays when the window is in focus if the system supports hiding the cursor\n- Fixed desktop buttons not working when switching from window capture\n- Fixed upside-down overlay when there were no frames getting captured\n- Fixed output error texture sometimes not getting set when switching capture source\n- Fixed Graphics Capture dashboard overlays not being positioned correctly sometimes\n- Fixed Graphics Capture overlays sometimes not appearing at launch\n- Fixed Graphics Capture thread error when switching to desktop from lost capture\n- Fixed desktop buttons not using numbered icon for desktop 6\n- Fixed multi-GPU mode being used when the preferred adapter wasn't found during desktop enumeration\n- Fixed Desktop Duplication not using the adapter of the mirrored output when they're not the same as the primary one\n- Fixed \"To HMD\" button not taking overlay origin scale of dashboard origins into account\n- Fixed \"Use Active Window\" not working on new windows\n- Fixed keyboard extension not displaying modifier state while an elevated application has focus (requires elevated mode or UIAccess to work)\n- Fixed possible action button ID conflict with settings button when icons are used\n- Fixed wrong working directory when launching applications through actions in elevated mode\n- Fixed settings icon being displayed in the Action Edit pop-up when the actual icon failed to load\n- Fixed some elements being too small when large interface display scale was used\n- Fixed blank section in performance graphs when SteamVR runs out of history\n- Fixed desktop cycle buttons not wrapping around when cycling backwards while [None] was selected as Graphics Capture source\n- Fixed repeated texture reloads on overlay and window names that contain characters that can't be found in any loaded fonts\n\nMore details about the additions can be found in the [Steam announcement](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/news\/app\/1494460\/view\/3015696795005719119).  \nThe new release can be found on [Steam](https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1494460\/Desktop\/) as well as on the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus), in the [releases section](https:\/\/github.com\/elvissteinjr\/DesktopPlus\/releases).  \nDesktop+ is a free and open-source project I'm working on in my spare time.

This includes every combination of running steam and\/or SteamVR as an administrator. Removed power saving settings, Removed USB devices within SteamVR, etc. \n\n\\-Deleted specific programs and drivers that were causing trouble to other users\n\n\\-Made sure only essential USB's were plugged in. This was only my mouse and keyboard. \n\n**---AFTER REINSTALLING WINDOWS---**\n\nI completely wiped my system, like absolutely everything. I then reinstalled Windows 10 Home\n\n\\-Downloaded Nvidia Drivers and made sure latest version is installed\n\n\\-Checked for and Downloaded any Windows Update that was available\n\n\\-Checked that BIOS was up to date(still was from earlier)\n\n\\-Installed Steam, Installed SteamVR\n\n\\*\\*\\*restarted pc just to apply any changes\\*\\*\\*\n\n \\-Plugged in Base Stations, Plugged in Headset, Tried to use Controllers as the directions say. \n\n \\-Once again did every combo of USB\/DP cuz that's what works for others apparently\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In conclusion, what have I figured out? well....**\n\n\\-The headset works, kinda... When messing with SteamVR, I am able to disable direct display mode. This causes my headset lights to go from blue to green, as the headset is now displaying my desktop. Audio works as well when it is in this configuration, as I tested a quick video. \n\n\\-While monitoring device manager, the USB comes up as: \"Generic SuperSpeed USB Hub\" \\*\\*keep in mind that I only looked for it a few times, but it seems to consistently come up as this\\*\\*. Windows makes the happy sound when I plug the USB in every port as well with no Error popups. Audio drivers for the headset are created, but only work when in extended display mode. \n\n\\-I have never gotten the controllers to display a green light other than when one was plugged in to a charging cord. They only light up blue and then shut off momentarily afterwards. \n\n**Hey, I also tried a second PC with nearly the same specifications. In fact, this second PC is used with a Quest 2 to run in a VR environment quite often. So what did my Valve Index do?**\n\n\\-Well the USB straight up is unrecognized by windows. It brings up the error prompt. It isn't mine to mess with the BIOS on or anything, but this is the new error I got. Progress...! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**P.S.** I have contacted steam support, and they actually got back within a day!

So far, I've had 5 VR and 12 Desktop teams (3-4 each) who really enjoyed it. There will be sessions starting from **Friday the 19th through to Sunday the 21st** so do get in touch! Thank you in advance for taking the time to read the invitation below:\n\n*I would like to invite you to participate in a research study titled \u201cTeamwork in a co-operative video game\u201d, as part of a PhD at the University of Portsmouth UK, funded by QinetiQ plc, a security and defence contractor in the UK.*\n\n*Participation is entirely voluntary and involves playing through \u201cShadow Raid\u201d on DS 1D difficulty in PayDay 2 with a minigun and RPG 7 (max 2 ECMs\/run and NO gameplay changing mods) as part of a team of 4. You will be required to play the game in either mouse+keyboard or VR set-up (your own), based on your preferences and experience. After, there will be questionnaires about your experience. The study will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to complete and it will take place entirely online, with the requirement that you join a specifically created Discord server for the purpose of the study, which you can leave once the study is over, and you have a* ***WORKING MICROPHONE***.\n\n*This study investigates teamwork in a co-operative video game with different hardware set-ups. Its primary purpose is to identify potential advantages and\/or constraints of these set-ups for facilitating teamwork in experienced teams. Additionally, it will contribute to my PhD thesis, thus helping me in obtaining my doctorate. Unfortunately, there is no monetary incentive for it.*\n\n***Inclusion Criteria:***\n\n* *Anyone over the age of 18.*\n* *Anyone with appropriate experience in and highly familiar with PayDay 2 in either its desktop form or VR form.*\n\n***Exclusion Criteria:***\n\n* *Anyone aged 0 - 17.*\n* *Anyone with visual field epilepsy.*\n* *Anyone with visual impairments which would make it hard or impossible to see and cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.*\n* *Anyone with neck injuries.*\n* *Anyone with hearing impairments that are not corrected with hearing aids.Anyone with speech impediments which may make it difficult to communicate clearly.*\n* *Anyone not fluent in English.*\n\n*If you are interested in taking part and* ***none of the exclusion criteria apply to you***, please contact the researcher Beata-Noemi Balint via Discord (beanb#8832) with any further questions you may have. Thank you for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: fixed the dates.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"ValveIndex","subreddit_id":"t5_r4yhp","subreddit_subscribers":66124,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"(still) Looking for heisters for a research study!
