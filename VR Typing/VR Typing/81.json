It\u2019s still very blurry. I can\u2019t read most texts unless they\u2019re in the dead center of my vision and even those texts are slightly blurry. I was playing Vegas infinite and I can\u2019t even read the instructions for the games. I watch videos online of people playing and they are crystal clear. Even when I look down at my hands in games, it is blurry. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have 20\/20 vision and don\u2019t wear glasses. I clean my lenses every time with a microfiber cloth. I adjust my eye tracking and interpupillary distance every time before I game. I\u2019m confident that I\u2019ve tried everything to find that sweet spot because I have gotten my picture better than initially. No matter what happens I can\u2019t get a great picture. I even tried playing a regular PS5 game through the headset and it was slightly blurry.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also noticed a faint blueish circle that looks like a reflection in the bottom center of my headset that I notice during darker games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried out a meta quest this weekend and it wasn\u2019t blurry at all.

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord on the PSVR2, but you should keep reading to decide for yourself.\n\nIt is a game designed with co-op for up to 4P set in a faithful recreation of the Ghostbusters universe, but the option to play co-op (including cross-play) doesn't open up until you complete the intro and one mandatory Infestation Mission ([18:05](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1085s)). Once you are past those, you can visit the main-menu ([24:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1440s)) and choose to host or join another player. The game supports standard Invite \/ Join system for your friends on the same VR platform and provides a lengthy 8-digit room code for friends on other VR platforms like Meta Quest ([24:58](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1498s)). The game also supports quick match to join you to those players that are playing as host and open to public.\n\nThe game is set in San Francisco and setup with a simple story setup that you will go through during the intro which also serves as your tutorial introducing you to familiar elements from Ghostbusters franchise such as PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, and Neutrono Wand (your proton stream weapon). Beyond the intro, where you are guided by female voice named Gabriela, she will continue to be your guide providing instructions and story context as you join the Ghostbusters. The central hub also has TV broadcast providing additional story context as the game continues.\n\nThe central hub is a Fire Station with stations for training ([24:14](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1454s)), upgrading equipment ([28:02](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1682s)), selecting player avatar and selecting missions. If playing co-op, especially once a cross-player is added (not sure why, but it seems to boost mic volumes), you will probably have to use settings to tweak audio so that VOIP is audible without being too loud ([29:10](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1750s)).  Once the game has given you ability to play co-op, you can continue solo or co-op by choosing from a number of different mission types across different locations, each time earning you currency you can use in the player hub area (fire station) to upgrade either your PKE Meter, Ghost Trap or Neutrono Wand.\n\nThe game original launched with 4 mission types, but 2 more were added post-launch:\n\n* Infestation ([30:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1800s)) allows you to go through a location with some small ghost encounters, ending with a ghost boss encounter.\n* Exorcism involves closing a portal, but to do this you have to use your PKE Meter to find 3 particular items, attach them to generators and unleash Ghost Boss encounter.\n* On The Clock is a mode where you fight against waves of enemies to ensure you can clear area in time permitted.\n* Giga Trap Retrieval involves finding correct location of trap and carefully extracting it which can have variety of effects that made it exciting.\n* Harvester involves repairing a machine and capturing ghosts.\n* Heist &amp; Seek ([43:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=2580s)) is a competitive mode where players go through multiple ghost encounters to catch golden ghosts while competing for who got the most gold.\n\nYou are expected to play these mission types repeatedly in the variety of locations for as long as you like. To complete the game, there are also story related missions involving additional characters and battle(s?) with Ghost Lord. We haven't played those yet. While playing co-op if any player is downed, they must high-five one of the remaining players to get revived. They are free to move around in their downed state.\n\nWhile playing you can encounter marshmallow packs which will attach a bunch of annoying mini-pufts to your body and Neutrono Wand. They have to be smacked (either by you or your allies) to resume ability for your weapon to work. At least one time in what we played (not covered in gameplay shared) my weapon wouldn't resume working even though we had gotten rid of all the mini-pufts. The game also hard crashed the time we tried playing Exorcism mid-mission so expect the possibility of some frustrating bugs that aren't patched way yet.\n\nIt looks like a simpler game than it is because there is skill involved in how you beam on to the tougher enemies where you first have have to take down their shield and then lasso-pull them to drain their health. While you are doing that, there is audio and even a visual temperature meter that displays on the ghost you are lasso-pulling and have to press X to give them a big hit or risk overheating your proton weapon. Then you have to place a trap and capture them before they recover. All while avoiding any area effect or projectile attacks that the ghosts are doing.\n\nWorth mentioning that the game defaults to smooth locomotion, but does offer option to change to teleport. It also offers blinders which are off by default. It defaults to a quick-turn option which is a happy medium between snap turn and smooth turn (both offered).\n\nI think it is much harder to play with teleport because you can't strafe out of the way of projectiles while maintaining fire, so if you would play with teleport (for VR comfort reasons), you should plan to be playing co-op rather than solo. Speaking of which, I actually wouldn't recommend this game for solo even if you can play with default of smooth locomotion because I think it is more fun co-op and also feels balanced for more players. I had to play on my wife's game just to help her get past the tutorial fights required solo so she could play co-op with us, and it wasn't as fun and I had to change to smooth locomotion to be able to complete it easier, then back to teleport for her VR comfort.\n\nThe game is using resistive triggers and haptic feedback in the controllers. I haven't felt any in haptics in the headset.

I played the original game almost 20 years ago, loved it and finished it many times back then, but never played it again until this weekend. Also RE Village VR mode has been a real blast for me and one of my best gaming experiences ever in more than 35 years playing video games. And even if I'm not really far I think that this RE4 is another step ahead. I decided to do my first run in hardcore mode to make it last longer. And damn, I'm literally spending 3 hours on certain maps since I get gangbanged by ennemies like crazy and it takes me dozens and dozens of attempts to pass them while not using too many ressources. But it's genuinely the most fun I ever had dying in a game since I first played Demon's Souls on PS3! \n\nJust running through the map luring ennemies into their own traps, exploiting landscape and ennemies explosives at your advantage, parrying an attack, doing a rotating kick while the ennemy is stunned and finishing him on the ground, taking down those zombie dogs with your knife while they're jumping on you, all of the combat mechanics feel so good in VR it's almost surrealistic! The exploration is great too with many treasures and secrets to find, and even if it seems that I ain't seen anything yet the boss fights look even better than in Village, which already had the most thrilling boss battles I had in my whole life! Yesterday I literally spent almost 2 hours at the shooting range just to get all the medals of the very first challenge, and it seems like there are plenty of them! Overall the challenge seems way better balanced than in Village where the VR sometimes gave you the impression of playing the game in \"god mode\", especially once you unlocked the unlimited ammos. Here I have to be carefull wirh my ammos and healing items not to run out of stock during a boss fight or a difficult area, and I love it!\n\nAnd the game looks so good! \ud83d\ude2e Village looked fantastic already and this RE4 seems at least as beautiful or even more, with less aliasing, an incredible level of details, and a lot of different locations that I can't wait to explore. Walking through the same map at a different time of the day can look like exploring a whole new location. The sunset diffusing on the buildings and ennemies, through the trees or even on your hands looks fantastic!\n\nAnyway it's only some early impressions, I'm not rushing the game but taking my time and enjoying every minutes out of it, I want to unlock everything and will probably go for the platinum trophy, and I already know that it will be my GOTY and one of the very best games I played in my whole life, high up with the ones like A Link to the Past, Seiken Densetsu 2, FF7, MGS, Xenogears, Demon's Souls, GT7 VR and RE Village VR.\n\nI hope that you all have at least half as much fun as I do playing this wonderful game!\n\n(here's a lot of emphasis, but that's my heart speaking!)","author_fullname":"t2_ntark0b0","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"RE4 remake VR mode is without a doubt one of the best gaming experiences I ever had!

The sunset diffusing on the buildings and ennemies, through the trees or even on your hands looks fantastic!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway it&amp;#39;s only some early impressions, I&amp;#39;m not rushing the game but taking my time and enjoying every minutes out of it, I want to unlock everything and will probably go for the platinum trophy, and I already know that it will be my GOTY and one of the very best games I played in my whole life, high up with the ones like A Link to the Past, Seiken Densetsu 2, FF7, MGS, Xenogears, Demon&amp;#39;s Souls, GT7 VR and RE Village VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope that you all have at least half as much fun as I do playing this wonderful game!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(here&amp;#39;s a lot of emphasis, but that&amp;#39;s my heart speaking!)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5f5cdbfc-af4c-11eb-8b84-0e8f7403ec69","can_gild":false,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"18ftwuw","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Papiculo64","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18ftwuw\/re4_remake_vr_mode_is_without_a_doubt_one_of_the\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18ftwuw\/re4_remake_vr_mode_is_without_a_doubt_one_of_the\/","subreddit_subscribers":227318,"created_utc":1702299296.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"I think it\u2019d be cool if PSVR2 had a PIP browser functionality so you could google guides and stuff for the games you play while in cinema mode.

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with it, I recommend playing Arizona Sunshine 2 on the PSVR2, especially if you have a friend you can play with on either PSVR2 or Meta Quest since the game supports cross-play.\n\nIt is a sequel to the 2016 original Arizona Sunshine which was a popular post-apocalypse setting zombie shooter in VR with co-op for up to 4 players. The new game adds an AI companion dog named Buddy that helps with puzzles and combat, and features a story campaign that can be played with up to 2 players or a horde mode that supports up to 4 players.\n\nThe game features a dark-humored protagonist who narrates the adventure who has gone a little crazy from lack of companionship leading up to meeting Buddy in the opening chapter, and I think it is both a great gameplay and storytelling mechanic because he isn't talking to himself only, but to Buddy when basically providing player clues or context through well acted voiced dialog. The games trailer had me concerned the protagonist would be too crass or annoying, but he is not.\n\nThe graphics in the game are among the best I have seen on the PSVR2. There is a good mix of being out in the bright and beautiful vistas of the Arizona desert and being in dark dank places as you progress through the campaign. I especially appreciate how the game has been designed to provide set-piece moments that only campaign games can provide while so many action games nowadays go the roguelite route for higher replay value, but don't have as memorable set-piece moments or campaign progression. The sound effects of zombie snarls, gun fire, explosions, etc are top notch. The game is using haptic feedback in the controllers including when petting Buddy, but I didn't feel any haptic feedback in the headset, like when taking damage from zombies.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is how long the loading is. There is really long loading every time you boot up the game. There is also some loading to restore to checkpoint if you died or between chapters which have the potential to drop your co-op partner and make all network functions of the game wonky requiring a reboot of game (starting [18:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_jNiuQyGjuE&amp;t=1080s)). This was a one time issue in my time playing so far, but worth noting.\n\nSince I played co-op with random public matchmaking, I was able to observe some issues specific to co-op to be aware of. The items available are not instanced for each player, so it is possible for player to take both hand guns at the start and then their co-op partner has no gun until they find another much further in the game. Similarly, if one player picked up the lighter, then it isn't available for other player. Aside issues like that, which can be managed with communication, I think it is a benefit to play with another player since one of you is allowed to die and you can still progress if the other makes it through, plus I personally favor playing co-op over single player. Another issue playing co-op is the pause menu doesn't show you your next objective or stats related to collectibles etc for the level like it does when playing single player. You are also more likely to see zombies blink out of existence while playing co-op especially when you are more spread apart because presumably the game has limited memory for all the zombies it is spawning \/ despawning as needed.\n\nInterestingly, none of the people I matched with were using their microphones to communicate. I know they could hear me, and at least one of them had their mic on because I could hear myself back from their TV speaker (not part of this gameplay video), but they stayed silent for their reasons (maybe language differences? maybe just shy?). On plus side, you can see player arm, hand and finger gestures as a way to communicate so voice-chat isn't essential, but I think would be better experience for all involved.\n\nThe game is tutorial light and unobtrusive about how it tries to hint the players progression. It will provide tool tips to help you learn how to use Buddy, but aside that it expects you to figure things out for yourself. Taking things slower and exploring is rewarded with finding different hats, more ammo, different possibly better weapons (ranged or melee), and materials that can be used to craft explosives like grenades or molotov cocktails. The inventory system is not explained well, but you can basically stow two ranged weapons on either holster, different types of ammunition to your chest, and use your two wrist slots to hold 1 item each (either melee or explosives). Just like the first game, you can wear any of the hats you find which is the main form of customizing how you look to your co-op partner. You can also stick a cigar in your mouth which can be lit with a lighter (by you or your partner). I think health regeneration is tied to surviving encounters or eating food items that can be found. There are collectibles that can be found, but I either found none or am not sure how they are supposed to be collected to count.\n\nHow good the replay value is probably depends on how much better it is to play on higher difficulty after players already know how to play the game better. I also haven't tried the 4P horde mode which may be different kind of fun. But, I am happy already with having a quality single player campaign game (playable 2P co-op) that is keeping me engaged.

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with it, I highly recommend playing Among Us VR on the PSVR2.\n\nIt is an asymmetric multiplayer game best described as social deduction where most of the players are crewmates and 1-2 (depending on total count of players) are impostor(s) on a spaceship. Which players get what role is randomly assigned by the game at the start of each round. As a crewmate, you have to complete tasks and find the impostor. As an impostor, you have to kill the crewmates and sabotage the ship. Whenever a body is discovered, you communicate with the remaining players alive using voice chat &amp; VR hand pointing \/ gestures and choose to eject the suspected impostor or skip your vote and the game continues until either all impostor(s) are ejected or the imposter(s) win.\n\nI have tried this game design before in flat, but it didn't click for me. However, in VR it is a much improved experience because of the VR perspective. Like being able to use hand gestures to point, seeing other players natural animations, having your back turned whenever you are doing any task, using VR interactivity during the mini-game oriented tasks, and more. The game is using haptic feedback during those VR interactions.\n\nThe game looks crisp and clear and the only visual issue I noticed is if any text is displayed (like during tutorial) that was too close to wall, it would oscillate trying to reposition itself making it harder to read, but if you step away from the wall, then it was fine. All other text and everything in the multiplayer game was flawless.\n\nThe game has standard VR comfort options like snap turning and blinders that can be turned off in settings. It doesn't have any option for teleportation, so all movement is full locomotion including moving, strafing and turning. The turning speed of smooth turning can be adjusted from too slow, to just right, to too fast. I settled on 150 being a good speed for smooth turning for myself where there was no feeling of reprojection while turning.\n\nEven playing near midnight (US Central) when this game stealth released for PSVR2, I had no problem finding game to play using Quick Match option because the game has cross-play and active community of online players presumably at all hours of the day. There was no lag \/ jitter or any other sign of network related issue during my play.\n\nThe game has a Platinum trophy, and the trophy list is entirely different from the flat version of the game, with almost all of the trophies having progression tracking and about doing a certain accomplishment X number of times. Based on how much I expect myself to play the game over time, I don't think the trophy list is asking too much for any of them with the highest count required being 500 tasks completed, and even being new and unfamiliar with the game, I completed 7 tasks in the two matches I played.\n\nYou can customize the look of your Among Us VR player avatar with some options available from start and others available to purchase via DLC. I don't know if the game will award any more customization options as part of more progression or not, but there are enough color options at start that the game room I joined, everyone had different color and was using different hats.\n\nThis is a very good game for $10 asking price and working great on the PSVR2.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Among Us VR on PSVR2 - First Impressions","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18am7xh","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1701702682.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded gameplay from early part of the game &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/p3EN4lGN7bE\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt; if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.

Gran Turismo\n2. RE 8\n3. NMS\n4. S&amp;S\n5. Red Matter\n6. Horizon\n7. Synapse\n8. Cross Fire Sierra Squad\n9. Walkabout Minigolf\n10. Moss 1\/2\n11. Propagation Paradise Hotel\n12. Vampire\n13. Beat Saber\n14. Pavlov\n15. VR Skater\n16. Song in the Smoke\n17. Barbaria\n18. Light Brigade\n19. FNAF\n20. Switchback\n21. Demeo\n22. Hubris\n23. Ghost Signal\n24. Tetris Effect\n25. SW Tales\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLets compare to the previous top 25 in August:\n\n1. RE8\n2. GT7\n3. S&amp;S\n4. Red Matter 2\n5. Wakabout Minigolf\n6. Demeo\n7. Song in the Smoke Rekindled\n8. Horizon\n9. Hubris\n10. Moss\n11. VR Skater\n12. Light Brigade\n13. Pavlov\n14. Synapse\n15. The Room\n16. Runner\n17. Beat Saber\n18. SW Tales\n19. Rez Infinite\n20. Zombieland\n21. Pistol Whip\n22. Tetris Effect\n23. SURVIVOR\n24. Zenith the Last City\n25. Cosmodread\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing to stand out is that Gran Turismo7 now beats out RE8. It makes sense since GT7 has received significant updates and its a game that has a longer tail in terms of gameplay. That is, the way it is designed, it is a game that many people will be playing periodically for a long time because of the VR experience itself, the large amount of context and the game as a service design (daily and weekly rewards and a seemingly infinite amount of cars). RE8 is probably still the most impactful experience, but it just doesn't have the same replayability.\n\nThe second thing that stands out is No Man's Sky shot up from not being included in the list to #3. This is thanks to the update that added foveated rendering which made the game a truly great experience to play. The game itself can be considered a triple A title in terms of its content and deep gameplay so having decent graphics was what it was missing and that update took it there. Another game with a similar update, though not as meaningful, was switchback, bringing it into the list at 20th place.\n\nNew games that came out since the previous list was made include Cross Fire Sierra Squad, Propagation Paradise Hotel, Vampire the Masquerade, Barbaria, FNAF and Ghost Signal. While some of these are ports of older games, its nice to see that we are seeing a nice stream of good new games each month.\n\nSome games were kicked out of the list due to these new or updated games but there were also games that just moved around. This is because those games have now become a bit more scrutinized. Horizon Call of the Mountain and Synapse notably went up and I think this is because people are gaining more appreciation of the quality of graphics and\/or gameplay they bring to the library. On the opposite spectrum, games like Demeo, Hubris and The Room (which left the list) went quite a bit down in the list and while they are still great games, it is clear that they didn't stand the test of time.\n\nThe games that were at the bottom of the original list and were kicked out included Zombieland, Pistol Whip, SURVIVOR, Zenith, Rez and Cosmodread. These are fine games and worthy addition to any library but they had to make space for the new and shiny and these games were still in the extended version of the list. Notably, Tetris Effect was at the bottom of the original list but managed to hang on in, even ending up above SW Tales of the Galaxy.\n\nAll in all, these are great games and this is one of the best resources for anyone looking to decide on what games to buy, it also goes to show just how good we have it with the library of games for the PSVR2. If you don't want to watch all of the 7 rivetting hours of debate, I recommend you wait for the top 25 list video that they have previously released after the debate.","author_fullname":"t2_hrqb8","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Top 25 from PSVR2 without parole (November edition)","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Articles &amp; Blogs"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_185nosk","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Articles &amp; Blogs","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1701146178.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gang at PSVR2 without parole just had their &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3XSnm6_aCoc\"&gt;top 25 debate&lt;\/a&gt; and it is not only a great source to figure out which are the best games to buy but I also thought it was interesting to see how games have changed in perception thanks to update or to just people playing them a bit more.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The list is the following&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RE 8&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NMS&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;S&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Red Matter&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Horizon&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Synapse&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cross Fire Sierra Squad&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walkabout Minigolf&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moss 1\/2&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Propagation Paradise Hotel&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vampire&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beat Saber&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pavlov&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VR Skater&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Song in the Smoke&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barbaria&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Light Brigade&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;FNAF&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Switchback&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demeo&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hubris&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ghost Signal&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SW Tales&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lets compare to the previous top 25 in August:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;RE8&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GT7&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;S&amp;amp;S&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Red Matter 2&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wakabout Minigolf&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demeo&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Song in the Smoke Rekindled&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Horizon&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hubris&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moss&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;VR Skater&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Light Brigade&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pavlov&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Synapse&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Room&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Runner&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beat Saber&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SW Tales&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rez Infinite&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zombieland&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tetris Effect&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;SURVIVOR&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Zenith the Last City&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cosmodread&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing to stand out is that Gran Turismo7 now beats out RE8.

I know how much better a game can be from the benefit of community feedback in that type of game development roadmap. A great example of that is how Hades became undisputed GOTY for so many in the year it left Early Access (after \\~2 years improving via community feedback) and then got stellar reviews leading to wider release beyond Steam.\n\nPlayStation really should have Early Access designation so that PSVR2 developers that want to develop their game idea with community feedback central to their roadmap (like Galaxy Kart) can use PSVR2 same way they do Steam without misunderstanding with the players served. They are doing that on Steam, so their intent is clear, but PlayStation players don't have benefit of being accustomed to or knowing that, and may purchase game initially with retail ready expectations and then be disappointed. It even causes reviewers to treat the game as retail release and trash it rather than just report it as news that an Early Access game is out and maybe give impressions without review scoring as a final product.\n\nGalaxy Kart is one example and a good one in the context of this discussion because it demonstrates how much a game can improve post-release, while still being in Early Access because it still needs more content and more improvements. If it continues to receive community support and feedback, it could become one of the best VR Kart Racing games on any platform and it possibly wouldn't exist at all if it couldn't be made and published into an Early Access designation that allows such a development roadmap.\n\nThere are certainly other PSVR2 games that have released where I think the developers should have made use of Early Access designation (if it were available on PlayStation) when releasing their game on PSVR2 because they were releasing with known significant issues to keep to some release date expectations with plans to patch post-release. Many that are still working on those post-release fixes, having already earned poor reviews and disappointed early adopters.\n\nAnyway, I think any developer that wants to do post-release community feedback based development should petition and seek an Early Access designation from PlayStation for how their games release, and otherwise hold on their product until it is ready for review and retail consumer expectations because those first impressions are very important.\n\nI think vast majority of us would be fine and accepting of both type of release models. It is when a game is released with retail expectations and then has significant issues (graphics or otherwise) that we get most disappointed with games where we were otherwise on board with the game idea.\n\nMajority of PSVR2 games are coming from Independent Studios, but so was Valve Corporation when it was making Half-Life \\~25 years ago and made difficulty decision to delay rather than release a product that they believed in but was still at the suck state and not ready for retail consumers.\n\nValve wouldn't be what it is today if they weren't willing to take that long-view on the relationship they want to have with their customers.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"\"Late is just for a little while.

There's some games I love that involve shooting but that's because they have other things going for them that draw me in. I decided to buy Switchback though (on sale) because my left controller analog stick is defective and so I figured this might be a fun game I can still play (no analog stick required).\n\n\\- I did play Rush of Blood on PSVR. I had fun with it, but it wasn't particularly memorable to me or anything.

The gun sounds didn't feel great to me, not matching the quality and impact of the awesome controller haptics. The music was usually very on-the-nose and generic horror sounds. That said, some sounds like the sound when you hit a marked target are wonderful. Overall the sound and music are fine, I just think it could be much better and it could have quite a big impact. I am very big into sound and music.\n\nThe horror design was lacking any kind of subtlety. Even the very opening of the game this is felt. Switchback loves to just POP things into your face. Again the sound is at fault too, because each and every time a loud horror sting accompanies these moments. Over and over and over the vast majority of horror design revolves around sudden, jump-scare-y, visual 'pops' that appear for a moment then disappear. It is so incredibly overused it just became funny.\n\nThat said, there's some nice design moments lurking in the game. My favourite level overall was the Doomed Mansion. In Doomed Mansion you still get plenty of those silly pop-horror moments, but there's a chunk of nice atmosphere setups and more varied enemies, set-pieces, and gameplay variations.\n\nThe boss fights were generally enjoyable but not interesting in terms of gameplay design. Once again the Doomed Mansion stands out with my favourite boss that did have more character to its design.\n\nThe story was not remotely impactful for me. Again this comes back to the middling design. It felt like the game expected that if you just shock the player with sudden scenes, that on its own would be enough to create some kind of connection or impact. But instead it feels, along with the general horror design, that there is a lack of setup, subtlety, context, and emotion. I got absolutely nothing out of the story of Switchback.\n\nSwitchback mixes up the shooting with some little puzzles. I thought this was fine but didn't really add to the game for me. I didn't mind that they were there but I don't think I'd miss any of them. There were a few that were MEH and a few that were neatso. But nothing that stands out like \"oh I'm so glad this was in the game\".\n\nThere are some different routes to take. I did not take any alternate routes. So I still have some game left to discover. Probably I won't do these any time soon, but I can see myself jumping in once in a blue moon to try a level and take the alternate paths.\n\nSo I am very critical of many aspects of Switchback. But, like I said at the start, this is a fun game. It's good. It looks pretty (this is a good looking game!) and I enjoyed the VR ride through all kinds of fun scenes.\n\nEssentially it is much closer to an amusement park than to a horror game.

It introduced me to the world of darkness and the 13 clans in vampire Masquerade. \n\nAfter playing the game and finishing probably a handful times, I was obsessed with the lore and discovered it was a tabletop rpg, and also there were novels. \n13 clan books were planned and over the years I bought and read [them](https:\/\/whitewolf.fandom.com\/wiki\/Clan_Novel_Saga) all. The lore is deep, the characters are amazing. \nI figured there was no way this wouldn't become main stream and movies and other games surely would come.\n\nBut silence for a few years, with the exception of an Aaron spelling [soap opera](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kindred:_The_Embraced) (starring Brian Thompson). It was loosely based on the source material, and was disastrously bad. \n\nThen silence for a few years. Until Vampire: [bloodlines](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Bloodlines) released in 2004. The game was everything I hoped for and more. Truly amazing. \n\nVampire: the masquerade [swansong](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Swansong) released last year and was *descent* enough.\n\nIt's been almost 20 years and besides thr promise or bloodlines 2 coming soon, it's been quiet for years. There were some releases since paradox bought the rights to world of darkness, but the games have been lacklustre or not what I was looking for.\n\nVampire: justice just scratches that itch for me. Ever since redemption, I'd wanted a story based on &gt;!

It introduced me to the world of darkness and the 13 clans in vampire Masquerade. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After playing the game and finishing probably a handful times, I was obsessed with the lore and discovered it was a tabletop rpg, and also there were novels. \n13 clan books were planned and over the years I bought and read &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/whitewolf.fandom.com\/wiki\/Clan_Novel_Saga\"&gt;them&lt;\/a&gt; all. The lore is deep, the characters are amazing. \nI figured there was no way this wouldn&amp;#39;t become main stream and movies and other games surely would come.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But silence for a few years, with the exception of an Aaron spelling &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kindred:_The_Embraced\"&gt;soap opera&lt;\/a&gt; (starring Brian Thompson). It was loosely based on the source material, and was disastrously bad. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then silence for a few years. Until Vampire: &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Bloodlines\"&gt;bloodlines&lt;\/a&gt; released in 2004. The game was everything I hoped for and more. Truly amazing. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vampire: the masquerade &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Swansong\"&gt;swansong&lt;\/a&gt; released last year and was &lt;em&gt;descent&lt;\/em&gt; enough.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been almost 20 years and besides thr promise or bloodlines 2 coming soon, it&amp;#39;s been quiet for years. There were some releases since paradox bought the rights to world of darkness, but the games have been lacklustre or not what I was looking for.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vampire: justice just scratches that itch for me. Ever since redemption, I&amp;#39;d wanted a story based on &amp;gt;! Clan assamite,  and giovanni (again)!&amp;lt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this game being in the very capable hands of FTG warms my heart and I&amp;#39;m just excited for the future.

That said, I like this more than something like Dishonored because you start much higher in the power curve. You are hunting more than hiding and having seen a modest tech tree there's clearly going to be more mechanics available throughout the game and I doubt they are all useless.

It feels like this game was made by folks who knew what they were doing.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Voice acting, music, etc. is good to me but at minimum serviceable for those with discerning tastes.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The level design seems very thoughtful with multiple puzzlelike ways to solve for them. &lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI is good enough to show it&amp;#39;s there but dumb enough to have fun with. I imagine you can cheese your way through some spots but that doesn&amp;#39;t bother me.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are collectables and I&amp;#39;m guessing a bit of exploration. Even the tutorial had well hidden room containing one.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you hate stealth games I can&amp;#39;t imagine this changing your mind. That said, I like this more than something like Dishonored because you start much higher in the power curve. You are hunting more than hiding and having seen a modest tech tree there&amp;#39;s clearly going to be more mechanics available throughout the game and I doubt they are all useless. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5f5cdbfc-af4c-11eb-8b84-0e8f7403ec69","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"17lvxko","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Fatbot3","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17lvxko\/vampire_the_masquerade_justice_quick_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17lvxko\/vampire_the_masquerade_justice_quick_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":225122,"created_utc":1698900686.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"I have uploaded early gameplay of the game [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dw7RvSbQxb8) if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with the game, I do recommend playing The Foglands on PSVR2, because I want to play more, but I have a number of precautions from my gameplay observations already to share with anyone else interested.\n\nIt is an action-adventure roguelike \/ roguelite where your task is to try and go deeper underground to take out a giant worm creature that is causing seismic activity for the underground human habitat you are part of. It appears to have a higher emphasis on NPC characters with dialog and story than typical roguelite, but I think a lower emphasis on what makes roguelite games more replayable because its combat mechanics are centered around shooting, punching, and throwing but from what I have played, it favors shooting and the starting pistol weapon which is offered every time at no scrap cost is perfectly adequate without any upgrades for all the combat required leading up to the 1st boss and I think for the boss as well. This leaves the punching and throwing unnecessary which is strange, but more on that below.\n\nThe roguelike aspect of the game involves finding purple chests that give you a choice of 3 cards that can boost various stats. Nothing that I found in what I played was particularly useful, but part of a roguelite game is improving game knowledge of possible upgrades that can influence your play style. For instance improving your melee attack knockbacks could make punching play style more useful combat option.\n\nSpeaking of punching, I found it useful to use one hand to punch any enemies that get too close while using my handgun for doing most damage, but when I tried to use both hands for punching, I found that to be a losing strategy because you can't use the thumbstick to move while you are making fists with both hands. It is more practical to shoot an enemy which staggers them, and then get close to punch them with your off hand. So I don't think a pugilist focused play style is viable here like you might expect in a roguelite that has punching as one of the combat pillars (per upgrade tree). Trying to use melee combat also makes the games enemy movement jankyness stand out.\n\nOn to throwing, the way it is implemented here has both things I liked and things that make it problematic. The way aiming and throwing works is using eye-tracking to select target and then you do throwing gesture to see the thrown object reliably find its target. It seems to only be using eye-tracking to select target for certain types of targets and there is a UI indication that remains active whether you are looking to throw something or not (maybe because you can always throw gun as well). I think this part is working well. There are also plenty of objects in all areas that can be picked up and thrown and weapons like knives can be reused after each throw by going and picking them up again. The main problem I encountered is around picking up objects quickly consistently. The game isn't using any jedi-pull to hand functionality, so you have to virtually touch to grab items (physical bending down required). But if you close your fist too early you might punch the thing you are trying to grab and break it instead of picking it up. Aside that, it doesn't separate settings for toggle holding gun vs items that may be thrown. Ideally, it should allow toggle to hold gun separate from how items (including ammunition) are grabbed and thrown (holding and releasing grip trigger instead of toggle). In Crossfire: Sierra Squad, the settings allow you to toggle hold on just gun, but lets grenades be grabbed and thrown more naturally. Something like that would be better for The Foglands as well. Lastly, you can't carry a lot of items that you can throw (with 4 inventory slots and 2 hands with 1 being used by your handgun), so this feature is good for when you are exploring or for puzzle doors \/ ramps, but not applicable to boss fights, so again, no roguelite play style focused around throwing even though your permanent upgrade tree has just three pillars (health, punching and throwing).\n\nOn to shooting, what is available from the start works well, but it can feel janky because of how weirdly the enemies move and react to being shot. There is also a slow-motion black-and-white moment that triggers but I don't understand how that benefits the player. I did find other weapons that can be picked up and used for a few shots and then with no way to reload them they have to be discarded. There are also weapons available from in-run vendor that offers to sell weapons that might be better than starting pistol. I don't know what I don't know, but I think each run will be starting with pistol and you won't get better \/ different weapons until you replay past earlier areas leading to first boss and only if you scavenged enough scrap. It seems the game lets you bank scrap instead of spending so you can use accumulation of banked scrap on subsequent run if no scavenging enough during current run. Unless you like scavenging and re-checking all the rooms each re-run, just so you will have the resources to get upgrades before boss fights, I think this could feel tedious over re-runs.\n\nAnother gameplay component worth noting are the traps like explosive barrels and oxygen canisters that can be triggered to explode. I like using such things in game, but they weren't impressing me in what I tried. If you manage to trigger an explosion near an enemy, you should be rewarded with their spectacular destruction. The explosions are happening, but don't seem to effect the enemies much. They seem to take more damage from a punch than an explosive barrel.\n\nI can't help but think this game would have been better if it wasn't a roguelite and just focused on being a single player action-adventure set in sci-fi-western-horror setting with interesting lore, characters and story with some choices provided and encouraged replay more similar to the Cave Digger games with multiple endings. I mean the type of game where you have checkpoints, like before boss fight and can retry until you succeed and then go further. In that type of game, you wouldn't have to replay a part of game that doesn't really change much on each re-run just to get to newer content. I say that because this game is fine to explore and scavenge an area the first time, but I don't think it will be fun to go through it multiple times on your way to the boss fights. Good roguelite games are ones where from start to end, there is always challenging \/ engaging gameplay (not just bosses) and choices that help shape the play style you will use for rest of your run. While they provide less content to progress through, they offer more gameplay systems and options to replay that content with. I don't think The Foglands s doing that when my next run would be starting exactly the same as my first run (with starting Pistol) and the purple chests (cards) are optional to find as you progress unlike in other roguelite where each area forces choices.\n\nAll that covered and something I hope developers can take note of to make improvements where possible, here are some positives. The game has generally higher production value than most PSVR2 games. It is built on Unreal Engine and definitely using Dynamic Foveated Rendering, although not consistently because sometimes the dialog text can be harder to read before it realizes what I am trying to look at. The soundtrack &amp; sound effects in particular are very good. The audio volume on the voice dialog could use some tuning (our character speaks too loudly), but dialog and voice acting are pretty good. I like the visual aesthetic and environmental story telling and I like the variety of rooms and sense of mystery I felt, at least first time playing through any area. The game doesn't have long \/ annoying loading screens, but there is minor frame stutter as you pass through the obvious smaller loading rooms or have to wait an extra second for a door to open if you sprinted to it too fast. If anything, it has too abrupt transition in some cases, like when taking elevator ride where the loading is to fast.

My first impressions are shared below:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my limited time with the game, I do recommend playing The Foglands on PSVR2, because I want to play more, but I have a number of precautions from my gameplay observations already to share with anyone else interested.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is an action-adventure roguelike \/ roguelite where your task is to try and go deeper underground to take out a giant worm creature that is causing seismic activity for the underground human habitat you are part of. It appears to have a higher emphasis on NPC characters with dialog and story than typical roguelite, but I think a lower emphasis on what makes roguelite games more replayable because its combat mechanics are centered around shooting, punching, and throwing but from what I have played, it favors shooting and the starting pistol weapon which is offered every time at no scrap cost is perfectly adequate without any upgrades for all the combat required leading up to the 1st boss and I think for the boss as well. This leaves the punching and throwing unnecessary which is strange, but more on that below.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The roguelike aspect of the game involves finding purple chests that give you a choice of 3 cards that can boost various stats. Nothing that I found in what I played was particularly useful, but part of a roguelite game is improving game knowledge of possible upgrades that can influence your play style. For instance improving your melee attack knockbacks could make punching play style more useful combat option.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of punching, I found it useful to use one hand to punch any enemies that get too close while using my handgun for doing most damage, but when I tried to use both hands for punching, I found that to be a losing strategy because you can&amp;#39;t use the thumbstick to move while you are making fists with both hands. It is more practical to shoot an enemy which staggers them, and then get close to punch them with your off hand. So I don&amp;#39;t think a pugilist focused play style is viable here like you might expect in a roguelite that has punching as one of the combat pillars (per upgrade tree). Trying to use melee combat also makes the games enemy movement jankyness stand out.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to throwing, the way it is implemented here has both things I liked and things that make it problematic. The way aiming and throwing works is using eye-tracking to select target and then you do throwing gesture to see the thrown object reliably find its target. It seems to only be using eye-tracking to select target for certain types of targets and there is a UI indication that remains active whether you are looking to throw something or not (maybe because you can always throw gun as well). I think this part is working well. There are also plenty of objects in all areas that can be picked up and thrown and weapons like knives can be reused after each throw by going and picking them up again. The main problem I encountered is around picking up objects quickly consistently. The game isn&amp;#39;t using any jedi-pull to hand functionality, so you have to virtually touch to grab items (physical bending down required). But if you close your fist too early you might punch the thing you are trying to grab and break it instead of picking it up. Aside that, it doesn&amp;#39;t separate settings for toggle holding gun vs items that may be thrown. Ideally, it should allow toggle to hold gun separate from how items (including ammunition) are grabbed and thrown (holding and releasing grip trigger instead of toggle). In Crossfire: Sierra Squad, the settings allow you to toggle hold on just gun, but lets grenades be grabbed and thrown more naturally. Something like that would be better for The Foglands as well. Lastly, you can&amp;#39;t carry a lot of items that you can throw (with 4 inventory slots and 2 hands with 1 being used by your handgun), so this feature is good for when you are exploring or for puzzle doors \/ ramps, but not applicable to boss fights, so again, no roguelite play style focused around throwing even though your permanent upgrade tree has just three pillars (health, punching and throwing).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On to shooting, what is available from the start works well, but it can feel janky because of how weirdly the enemies move and react to being shot. There is also a slow-motion black-and-white moment that triggers but I don&amp;#39;t understand how that benefits the player. I did find other weapons that can be picked up and used for a few shots and then with no way to reload them they have to be discarded. There are also weapons available from in-run vendor that offers to sell weapons that might be better than starting pistol. I don&amp;#39;t know what I don&amp;#39;t know, but I think each run will be starting with pistol and you won&amp;#39;t get better \/ different weapons until you replay past earlier areas leading to first boss and only if you scavenged enough scrap. It seems the game lets you bank scrap instead of spending so you can use accumulation of banked scrap on subsequent run if no scavenging enough during current run. Unless you like scavenging and re-checking all the rooms each re-run, just so you will have the resources to get upgrades before boss fights, I think this could feel tedious over re-runs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another gameplay component worth noting are the traps like explosive barrels and oxygen canisters that can be triggered to explode. I like using such things in game, but they weren&amp;#39;t impressing me in what I tried. If you manage to trigger an explosion near an enemy, you should be rewarded with their spectacular destruction. The explosions are happening, but don&amp;#39;t seem to effect the enemies much. They seem to take more damage from a punch than an explosive barrel.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but think this game would have been better if it wasn&amp;#39;t a roguelite and just focused on being a single player action-adventure set in sci-fi-western-horror setting with interesting lore, characters and story with some choices provided and encouraged replay more similar to the Cave Digger games with multiple endings. I mean the type of game where you have checkpoints, like before boss fight and can retry until you succeed and then go further. In that type of game, you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to replay a part of game that doesn&amp;#39;t really change much on each re-run just to get to newer content. I say that because this game is fine to explore and scavenge an area the first time, but I don&amp;#39;t think it will be fun to go through it multiple times on your way to the boss fights. Good roguelite games are ones where from start to end, there is always challenging \/ engaging gameplay (not just bosses) and choices that help shape the play style you will use for rest of your run. While they provide less content to progress through, they offer more gameplay systems and options to replay that content with. I don&amp;#39;t think The Foglands s doing that when my next run would be starting exactly the same as my first run (with starting Pistol) and the purple chests (cards) are optional to find as you progress unlike in other roguelite where each area forces choices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that covered and something I hope developers can take note of to make improvements where possible, here are some positives. The game has generally higher production value than most PSVR2 games. It is built on Unreal Engine and definitely using Dynamic Foveated Rendering, although not consistently because sometimes the dialog text can be harder to read before it realizes what I am trying to look at. The soundtrack &amp;amp; sound effects in particular are very good. The audio volume on the voice dialog could use some tuning (our character speaks too loudly), but dialog and voice acting are pretty good. I like the visual aesthetic and environmental story telling and I like the variety of rooms and sense of mystery I felt, at least first time playing through any area. The game doesn&amp;#39;t have long \/ annoying loading screens, but there is minor frame stutter as you pass through the obvious smaller loading rooms or have to wait an extra second for a door to open if you sprinted to it too fast. If anything, it has too abrupt transition in some cases, like when taking elevator ride where the loading is to fast. Comparing to other game releases that have clear need of post-release patches, I think The Foglands has more minor issues on polish that could be fixed with patches, and potentially a bigger issues of game design (not being a good roguelite) that probably won&amp;#39;t have any fix, but it can still be a decent action-adventure-horror game ignoring the roguelite expectation shortcomings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these are early impressions.

These combined factors have affected our development timeline more than we initially anticipated.\n\nAdditionally, in preparation for the PlayStation VR2 launch, we have been diligently reviewing the game's performance and optimizing it across all maps to ensure a seamless experience for all of our console players. In this regard, we had to rework Maple Lodge Campsite with a completely new layout (more information below).

I will eventually upload early gameplay from the game on my [YT channel](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/cusman), but I am ready to share first impressions now.\n\nBased on my limited time with it, I highly recommend playing Waltz of the Wizard on the PSVR2, especially if you have interest in sharing VR gameplay experience with another player using Local Co-Op.\n\nWhen you start this game up, you will start in a room and a talking skull will give you some minimal instruction, and there is a barrier that has broad conditions for you to clear before you can leave the room to go to next.\n\nThis starting room is there to allow you to learn 12 different magics and try them out. You do this by mixing 3 different types of ingredients in 12 possible combinations. You can place your hand on a space to clear magic to proceed to next. The types of magic range from making things big or small, turning things into butterflies or frogs, making things weightless or magnetized, casting fireballs or making things explode into fireworks, and even giving you ability to draw anything you want in thin air, and then you can grab and use whatever you drew. One of the abilities even lets you record what the thing will do for a few seconds, so very similar to central puzzle solving mechanic in **The Last Clockwinder**, but here, at least in this learning stage, your reason to do any of these is to try them out, use your own creativity and enjoy the spectacle.\n\nThe graphics and physics simulation \/ interactions are very good. This is not a game that isn't using full potential of PS5 and PSVR2.\n\nIn the same room, you can physically interact with a xylophone musical instrument which if you play certain song will transport you to a short scene, which upon completion returns you to the room. There is also a crossbow and target practice mini-game. This room has number of secrets to uncover which generally awards trophies.\n\nThe 2nd room is where the game will introduce you to voice commands for casting spells, and give you mini-quests before you can proceed to next area.\n\nThe game is very good at recognizing voice commands, showing you text of what it thinks you are saying, and the system is intuitive and I think a good way to be able to cast so many different spells. The spells aren't limited to the 12 you learned in the 1st room. There is a broader vocabulary of possible spells and how to apply them to different objects that are available or that you cast out of thin air.\n\nWithin settings, you can also enhance the way your own voice casting sounds. The soundtrack, effects, voice dialog, your own voice commands and options to enhance your immersion is the full package here.\n\nThe 3rd room is where the game provides a wider area and it is essentially a playground where you can throw darts, shoot hoops, etc. The most important part is a wall with posters that show you a broad vocabulary of different voice commands you can use.\n\nThe 4th room is where the game wants you to learn a few more concepts and then it opens up the Observer Fortress which is where you will use everything you have learned (and more?) in whatever way makes sense to you to complete the game. I haven't gone deep into that yet, but there is a story with antagonists and combat and puzzles.\n\n**So how does local co-op work?**\n\nThe VR player has to first enable co-op mode in settings, and then another player using DualSense controller can join\/leave co-op at any time using the Options button (with DualSense controller powered and signed-in). The co-op player is a floating head that can fly around in all directions, has ability to grab and throw things, can ping\/highlight objects, and shoot a projectile.\n\nI think the early part of the game (4 rooms of self-paced tutorial) is a really cool VR experience, and something that both players should go through as the VR player. I also think that starting area is a good showcase for the PSVR2 for new VR players. The game has options to enable smooth movement and smooth turning, so defaults to VR safe options for new players. Anyway, when it is the 2nd player playing VR first time is when co-op player (already experienced with game) can be most useful as assist player.\n\nBeyond the \\~1 hour orientation you can take turns playing through Observer Fortress as VR player or whomever prefers VR versus being the assist player on TV screen.\n\nThe game looks a lot better within the VR headset than it does for the flat-screen co-op player, and I think the gameplay for the VR player is more engaging, but I think being able to play together makes up for it.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Waltz of the Wizard on PSVR2 - First Impressions including of Local Co-Op","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_173v7fx","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1696866637.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t uploaded any gameplay from the game at this time, but you can check this tiny 33 second &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/GFDHitCE6lU\"&gt;trailer of local co-op&lt;\/a&gt; from Aldin.

I haven&amp;#39;t gone deep into that yet, but there is a story with antagonists and combat and puzzles.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how does local co-op work?&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The VR player has to first enable co-op mode in settings, and then another player using DualSense controller can join\/leave co-op at any time using the Options button (with DualSense controller powered and signed-in). The co-op player is a floating head that can fly around in all directions, has ability to grab and throw things, can ping\/highlight objects, and shoot a projectile.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the early part of the game (4 rooms of self-paced tutorial) is a really cool VR experience, and something that both players should go through as the VR player. I also think that starting area is a good showcase for the PSVR2 for new VR players. The game has options to enable smooth movement and smooth turning, so defaults to VR safe options for new players. Anyway, when it is the 2nd player playing VR first time is when co-op player (already experienced with game) can be most useful as assist player.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ~1 hour orientation you can take turns playing through Observer Fortress as VR player or whomever prefers VR versus being the assist player on TV screen.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game looks a lot better within the VR headset than it does for the flat-screen co-op player, and I think the gameplay for the VR player is more engaging, but I think being able to play together makes up for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/6hSTUyFGV-IvwGVPLayBsBKYDCMdDzh0rCwcixMaA4s.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1f87db2fc6f7323ffe1d4b6c9d0afbeca3b81be0","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/6hSTUyFGV-IvwGVPLayBsBKYDCMdDzh0rCwcixMaA4s.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4bcaf6b8c9b1b37df2559ffdda7a52e8df510ee7","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/6hSTUyFGV-IvwGVPLayBsBKYDCMdDzh0rCwcixMaA4s.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab1481da3575039930ea10ea64e5786ec25fd8bf","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/6hSTUyFGV-IvwGVPLayBsBKYDCMdDzh0rCwcixMaA4s.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3aa3a595534952154561e80ee4f2fba64b68b754","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"vAXbuJ2PqL8MlSLi36W4ujsS8qKmawqHFN7884Ne82U"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"173v7fx","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/173v7fx\/waltz_of_the_wizard_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/173v7fx\/waltz_of_the_wizard_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":223927,"created_utc":1696866637.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"Is there a way to synch my phone to the vr or ps network?

Being positive is good!  Trolls are forcibly negative and we know they are bad, so being forcibly positive must be good right?  After all who can argue against being positive!  It's LITERALLY POSITIVE!\n\nWell here me out...\n\nForced positivity isn't actually good.  And here's an explanation why.\n\nSomething I see brought up a lot recently is unrealistic expectations.  \n\nPeople have these unrealistic expectations!  Sony should release 100 AAA games a month!  Sony should make every state of play 100% about PSVR!  \n\nBut where did those unrealistic expectations come from?  Are people just entitled idiots? \n\nNo... they came from here.  This sub.  \n\nAnd other places like youtube and social media but definitely a lot from this very sub.  Go back 6 months prior to launch and look at the comments and what people were aggressively telling people PSVR2 was going to be.  Sony was going to force every first party to release all games in a hybrid VR mode!  Sony had tested the waters with VR1 and was now ready to really spend the big $$$!!! This is going to end PCVR!   We are going to see at least one AAA title month!  It's the end of crappy mobile games being passed off as VR, THIS will herald the REAL era of VR games!\n\nThere's one user who literally bet is entire 3080 gaming rig that PSVR would have more AAA exclusives than PCVR this year.  \n\nAnd if you weren't accepting this positivity you were likely to be pretty heavily attacked for being negative or stupid or a quest shill (sound familiar?)\n\nSo now here we are and these most of these users have silently slipped away, last I checked the 3080 bet guys account had gone silent months before release.  \n\nAnd what's left?  People who were bludgeoned into accepting these high expectations and are now disappointed but the forced positivity has turned on them again...\n\nNow the forced positivity means you can't blame Sony for VR2 not meeting your expectations.  We must be patient, we must wait, we must buy more headsets to grow the market, we must be responsible for VR2 success, not Sony.  Sony don't owe you anything!  \n\nAnd this is the cycle has repeated since the very early days of PSVR1.  \n\nI still remember aggressively arguing with a user who swore that PSVR1 was going to be better than PCVR because it was going to have more physical pixels on the display near the middle of the panel.  Clearly he was misunderstanding the nature of warped rendering and rendered pixel distribution but he just would NOT accept that Sony wasn't going to invent some new way to fab OLED Panels so that they wouldn't be an even rid of pixels. \n\nUnrealistic, irrational... straight up impossible expectations were held for VR before launch and guess what happened post launch if you weren't happy?  \n\nGet out an don't let the door hit ya where the lord split ya. \n\nThat's why the sub needs better memory... both because we keep repeating the same mistake over and over, but also because in the short term you only know what makes you pissed off, not why.  When you only know that you get mad at the people who piss you off. \n\nBut when you know why, you can rightly be mad at what made them be the way that pisses you off. \n\nAt the top of this post I noted that forced positivity is the opposite of forced negativity so we know it must be good right? \n\nAnd that's not right.  \n\nThe solution to one end of the spectrum isn't the other end of the spectrum, it's the middle. \n\nBoiling isn't the answer if your freezing. \n\nDrowning isn't the answer if your dying of thirst. \n\nForced positivity is not the answer to forced negativity. \n\nThe answer is a an objective and reasonable middle ground.   One where you can accept and discuss the negative aspects as well as the positive ones.  Not one where you are forced to do either. \n\nBecause forced positivity is toxic positivity. \n\nSo why write up this whole wall of text?  Because it's getting really old seeing (and fighting) the same battles over and over.  And I know this isn't going to magically fix the problem.

Being positive is good!  Trolls are forcibly negative and we know they are bad, so being forcibly positive must be good right?  After all who can argue against being positive!  It&amp;#39;s LITERALLY POSITIVE!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well here me out...&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forced positivity isn&amp;#39;t actually good.  And here&amp;#39;s an explanation why.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something I see brought up a lot recently is unrealistic expectations.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have these unrealistic expectations!  Sony should release 100 AAA games a month!  Sony should make every state of play 100% about PSVR!  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But where did those unrealistic expectations come from?  Are people just entitled idiots? &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No... they came from here.  This sub.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And other places like youtube and social media but definitely a lot from this very sub.  Go back 6 months prior to launch and look at the comments and what people were aggressively telling people PSVR2 was going to be.  Sony was going to force every first party to release all games in a hybrid VR mode!  Sony had tested the waters with VR1 and was now ready to really spend the big $$$!!! This is going to end PCVR!   We are going to see at least one AAA title month!  It&amp;#39;s the end of crappy mobile games being passed off as VR, THIS will herald the REAL era of VR games!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s one user who literally bet is entire 3080 gaming rig that PSVR would have more AAA exclusives than PCVR this year.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you weren&amp;#39;t accepting this positivity you were likely to be pretty heavily attacked for being negative or stupid or a quest shill (sound familiar?)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So now here we are and these most of these users have silently slipped away, last I checked the 3080 bet guys account had gone silent months before release.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;#39;s left?  People who were bludgeoned into accepting these high expectations and are now disappointed but the forced positivity has turned on them again...&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now the forced positivity means you can&amp;#39;t blame Sony for VR2 not meeting your expectations.  We must be patient, we must wait, we must buy more headsets to grow the market, we must be responsible for VR2 success, not Sony.  Sony don&amp;#39;t owe you anything!  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And this is the cycle has repeated since the very early days of PSVR1.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still remember aggressively arguing with a user who swore that PSVR1 was going to be better than PCVR because it was going to have more physical pixels on the display near the middle of the panel.  Clearly he was misunderstanding the nature of warped rendering and rendered pixel distribution but he just would NOT accept that Sony wasn&amp;#39;t going to invent some new way to fab OLED Panels so that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be an even rid of pixels. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unrealistic, irrational... straight up impossible expectations were held for VR before launch and guess what happened post launch if you weren&amp;#39;t happy?  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Get out an don&amp;#39;t let the door hit ya where the lord split ya. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why the sub needs better memory... both because we keep repeating the same mistake over and over, but also because in the short term you only know what makes you pissed off, not why.  When you only know that you get mad at the people who piss you off. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But when you know why, you can rightly be mad at what made them be the way that pisses you off. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the top of this post I noted that forced positivity is the opposite of forced negativity so we know it must be good right? &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s not right.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The solution to one end of the spectrum isn&amp;#39;t the other end of the spectrum, it&amp;#39;s the middle. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boiling isn&amp;#39;t the answer if your freezing. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drowning isn&amp;#39;t the answer if your dying of thirst. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Forced positivity is not the answer to forced negativity. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The answer is a an objective and reasonable middle ground.   One where you can accept and discuss the negative aspects as well as the positive ones.  Not one where you are forced to do either. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because forced positivity is toxic positivity. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So why write up this whole wall of text?  Because it&amp;#39;s getting really old seeing (and fighting) the same battles over and over.  And I know this isn&amp;#39;t going to magically fix the problem.   There will still be irrational people on all parts of the spectrum.  But I&amp;#39;m just hopeful that maybe if enough people read this maybe a few of you will recognize it the next time you see it, and even if you don&amp;#39;t actively shut it down, maybe won&amp;#39;t actively support it. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s fine be excited and happy, but it&amp;#39;s important to be realistic, rational and accepting of things that aren&amp;#39;t

My original had a dead spot on the right screen and Sony (Canada) quickly sent me a box to ship it back and very quickly sent me back a refurbished unit.\n\nSo, of course my brain is looking for problems, but I feel this replacement is slightly blurrier (less sharpness) and that there is more aliasing than my previous hmd.\n\nUnfortunately, I haven't clocked a lot of hours on PSVR 2 having only bought it last May and only really finishing the base game of Saints and Sinners (the first one) and Tetris Effect.  These game seem to have a little more aliasing than I remember.

And I've tried the Quest and Quest 2 for shorter amounts of time).\n\nWhen I got the PS VR2 a few months ago I didn't have the G2 to compare them, I'd given it to a friend.\n\nToday I was reunited (temporarily) with the G2 headset and very literally tried PS VR2 and Reverb G2 side by side with the same games to compare.\n\nI was I guess pleasantly surprised that my intuitive feelings on their differences based on when I first tried the PS VR2 without the G2 present, were basically all accurate! Anyways, here's the details --\n\nI tried 3 games:\n\n\\- Organ Quarter\n\n\\- The Light Brigade\n\n\\- No Man's Sky\n\nI had both headsets turned on simultaneously and swapped easily between them, so this was very much side by side testing. I moved my headphones over to the respective headset each time as well, because sound affects my enjoyment and feeling of immersion, so I felt it was important to have sound when testing each one.\n\n**COLOURS AND BLACKS**\n\nI remember when I first tried PS VR2, booted up Thumper, I exclaimed how amazing the colours were from what I remembered on my G2.\n\nStill though, I had that doubt in my head if I was remembering clearly, maybe it was just placebo, etc.\n\nSo it was still a kind of surprise when I booted up Organ Quarter, into a cool area that I had an identical save slot for on both PCVR and PS VR2, and discovered just how much more vibrant the PS VR2 colours really are.\n\nThere is a MASSIVE difference in colour. And in the blacks. On the G2, the reds were pale, and the blacks were... also pale. Everything felt pale in the G2 after coming out of the PS VR2. It was an impactful area to experience this, surrounded by deep red oscillating organic matter and black abyss stretching before me.\n\nThe same differences were present in The Light Brigade and No Man's Sky.\n\nThe difference in brightness was also significant and I think contributed to the G2 suddenly feeling rather pale.\n\nKeep in mind, the G2 is considered to have one of the best LCD displays available for consumer headsets, and also one of the brighter displays.\n\nIt was impactful experiencing what I already technically knew to be the case on paper and from memory - the PS VR2 has stunning colours, vibrancy, and blacks. And it's not a subtle difference, it's a significant, immediately apparent difference.\n\n**VISUAL CLARITY**\n\nLike I mentioned above, the G2 is known for having one of the best LCD displays of a consumer headset. Where it really shines is the simple visual clarity. Besides having a resolution that's slightly higher than PS VR2, it also just has a really nice clear display.\n\nThis was noticeable to me, and it was also what I already expected again based on my impressions from memory. Especially in the Light Brigade, where there's lots of fog, the pure visual clarity of the G2 was really pleasant and appealing, better than the PS VR2. Edge to edge clarity was similar to PS VR2, with text in the corner of my eyes reading similarly on both (No Man's Sky menu). But yeah the G2 just had a particular sharpness to it that the PS VR2 doesn't quite reach.\n\nAlso, in terms of graphic quality, I don't have a great test here. For example, No Man's Sky did look better still on my PC (3070 GPU equivalent) than PS VR2, with less aliasing and probably also lusher grass (planet quality set to ultra). However, it was a stuttery mess (already reduced to 70% resolution). So this is not a fair comparison. I literally cannot play No Man's Sky on those settings, and in fact the last time I tried to play NMS in VR on my PC I gave up, because I couldn't get it to look good enough to satisfy me while maintaining performance that was acceptable (I am comfortable with reprojection - but it dips below that into really messy territory).\n\nSimilarly in Organ Quarter, I'd say graphically they looked the same except that there was less aliasing on PC. But again I didn't have it running perfectly smooth.\n\nSo basically I don't have a great test for this, and it will be different on different PC hardware anyways, but roughly speaking I'd say the PS VR2 is capable of similar graphical output to a 3070 GPU. \n\n**FOV**\n\nOf all the tests, this one did surprise me a little bit.\n\nOn my G2 I have an 'FOV mod', the original face gasket is replaced with an ultra thin gasket. Actually, this is not my preference, I was pressured to make this change because the original face gasket fell apart and to replace it is significantly more expensive than the 3rd party option. (I'll get into the reasons I don't like it as much in the next section).\n\nBecause of this ultra thin gasket on the Reverb G2, the FOV of the two headsets seemed functionally identical. I tested multiple times, by trying to go to the same spot in identical games and taking note of what I could see. I'm quite confident both horizontal and vertical FOV were essentially identical.\n\nWorth noting also that besides the ultra-thin gasket, the G2 with the standard gasket already has a larger FOV than the Quest 2 or Rift S.\n\nSo anyways, the result is that both the PS VR2 and G2 have pretty good and equivalent FOV potential, with stock PS VR2 presumably being a bit larger than stock G2.\n\n**Comfort**\n\nEveryone's head is different, and it's clear from reading many VR impressions over the years that a comfortable headset for one person can be super uncomfortable for another. The G2 with the original face gasket was the most comfortable headset, for me, that I ever owned. It's also a very light headset compared to most, even slightly lighter than PS VR2.\n\nThe PS VR2 is quite comfortable for me. I've had some issues where I don't have it sitting right and it starts to hurt my head, but by now I have it sitting well and can wear it for long periods of time.\n\nAlso my headphones fit a little better over the PS VR2 than the G2 (I don't use the built-in headphones cuz I'm an audiophile :p), although they don't fit perfectly over either headset. But yeah good enough on both and slightly better on PS VR2.\n\nWith the 3rd party face gasket, the G2 is unfortunately much less comfortable for me, hence why I prefer the original. I have prescription lenses, and they press slightly against my forehead on the modded G2, and in general I feel like the fit of this gasket just isn't nearly as comfortable, and the material is not as pleasant. I can still be okay using it but yeah it's not great and affects my enjoyment.\n\nSo the PS VR2 is more comfortable than my modded G2, but probably I'd say it's a bit less comfy than that original G2 gasket that fit my face perfectly.\n\nHowever, there's more to discuss!\n\nI really love the material of the PS VR2 gasket. When I first put it on I was shocked by how different it felt from any other VR headset I'd put on. I was a bit worried because of the unexpected difference. But I quickly felt that I liked it way more. It's a very light and loose material that is barely noticed on the face. Every other headset I've used, including the G2 whether the modded gasket or original, fits to your face like a glove... not in a good way. It feels like your face is trapped inside there. Not only does it remind me I'm wearing a headset, but it also traps heat and sweat.\n\nNow... here is something interesting, that I'm not 100% sure about and isn't relevant to most people probably, but I think it's worth mentioning -\n\nI have a skin condition 'seborrheic dermatitis' that affects my face. It isn't fully understood what causes it to flare up but basically it will flair up sometimes, and when it does my face gets itchy and red.\n\nFor the last few years before I got PS VR2, using the G2 and the Rift S before that, I sometimes felt like it would flare up after being in VR. At first I thought maybe the gasket needed cleaning, and I did deep cleaning on the gasket. But the issue persisted. I started to think it was probably unrelated to the headset - the itching wasn't even corresponding to where the headset was touching my face.\n\nBut as I write this post, my face is itching in a way that it hasn't since... the last time I used the G2.\n\nSo, I don't know for sure, but my theory is this:\n\nI think that because of the style of headset as discussed above, the way it traps the face, the result is that moisture\/sweat get trapped in my face, affecting even the areas outside of what the headset is actually 'trapping'.\n\nThe PS VR2 meanwhile not only lets my face breathe more, but it also has a built-in fan that many people forget about because it's whisper quiet.\n\nSo, for me at least, it seems that this makes a significant difference. With the PS VR2 I have not had this itching face issue at all, and I suspect it is directly a result of the different headset designs.\n\nSo!! In summary, the PS VR2 is significantly more comfortable for me, not just in terms of head pressure (where it falls slightly behind the G2 in its original form), but specifically and especially in terms of breathability. While most people probably won't be as affected by that as me, I think it should be a consideration for anyone.\n\n**Ease of Use**\n\nNo surprises here, the PS VR2 is way easier for me to use.\n\nI think this goes for just about anyone comparing PCVR to PS VR2, but it's especially true in my case... using the G2 is all kinds of messy, made even messier because of my unbending desire for high fidelity audio.\n\nThe G2 does not have a headphone jack (grrrrrRRRRRR) so I run an ultra long headphone cable from my computer to use headphones. There are index-like ear speakers that come with the G2, but as mentioned, I don't find them to be good enough quality (most people will be happy enough with them. They are probably a bit higher quality than the PS VR2 in-ear headphones, and more comfortable since they don't even touch your ear, and you don't have to put them on, but I think they don't have as much bass as even the little in-ear headphones. Note that I haven't done a direct comparison, just my impression from memory).\n\nI'm used to the G2 wmr software back-end by now, but it's still annoying and sometimes causes problems.\n\nIn general there's a variety of problems that can crop up and require fixing from time to time.\n\nThe G2 has a heavier and messier cable setup. A single cable leaves the G2 but essentially splits to 3 cables. Two of these go into my computer, the third goes into a power outlet.\n\nThe G2 also must be powered on\/off from a little power brick in the middle of the cable.\n\nThe G2 controllers don't track as well.\n\nThe G2 has absolutely awful passthrough that sometimes I can't even get to activate, and when it works it's a low quality 'flashlight' passthrough, where you see a small cone of space based on where you point your controller. It's practically useless.\n\nThe G2 does have a nice flip-up design that makes it easy to flip it up and see the world around you without taking off the whole headset. However, with the high quality and easy to use passthrough on PS VR2, this feature on the G2 is essentially redundant and a disadvantage in comparison.\n\nThe steamVR interface has come a long way but it's still much more annoying navigating your computer to access a game than it is to navigate the PS5 menu. When a VR game is on your SteamVR quickmenu it's easy to open though. Also, obviously the ability to navigate your PC with a PCVR headset is a whole other feature that is not possible on PS VR2. There's lots of issues with it but yes there are plenty of things you can do with a PCVR headset that you can't with PS VR2, and that can be cool.\n\nOverall, PS VR2 is way easier to use.\n\n**Controllers and other headset features**\n\nAnother obvious one, I won't spend long on it, but it must be mentioned - PS VR2 has way better controllers. They feel better, they have haptics that are a bajillion times better, adaptive triggers, capacitive touch (the G2 controllers cannot sense any button touching), better tracking, and cooler design! I also absolutely prefer the ring placement on the sense controllers at the back, rather than the traditional VR controller placement that has the ring at the front. Finally hands can be brought together!\n\nAnd of course, the PS VR2 has eye tracking and headset rumble to boot, which are wonderful features.\n\nAnd, although only rarely used, the PS VR2 is capable of native, full 120Hz gameplay. I believe this is used in a couple games like Thumper and Rez Infinite (I know it was on the original PS VR, it is my guess\/assumption that it is the same on PS VR2). The G2 is only capable of 90Hz max (and like the PS VR2, and any PCVR headset, you are often stuck with reprojection because of performance struggles. The reprojection algorithms differ though. The G2 algorithm I think is even worse than the PS VR2. But the Oculus and Index reprojection systems might be better).\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nThe PS VR2 is not a strict upgrade to the Reverb G2 (and I never thought it was).\n\nHowever, for me, I prefer the PS VR2.\n\nWhat the G2 has is the really crystal clear visual clarity. I think as a PC headset specifically, this is particularly valuable, because on PCVR I sometimes am using the headset to navigate my computer or watch movies and the crystal clear visual clarity is a particularly valuable asset in these areas.\n\nI do also think it's particularly impactful in some specific games, like The Light Brigade with all the fog.\n\nHowever, overall and for games in particular, I absolutely prefer the vibrant colours, true blacks, and brightness of the PS VR2. While not as crystal clear, it's still got good clarity to it and looks wonderful.\n\nAnd then there's so many other areas where the PS VR2 shines for me. The breathability, the ease of use, the feature set.\n\nWhat PCVR has is what PCVR will always have, and will probably always have over console. On PCVR I can navigate my computer, watch movies, listen to music with a VR music visualizer,... Today I tried Realms of Flow which I've been excited to try (I want this on PS VR2!!!!!!!). It's a beautiful meditation app. I was presented with absolutely gorgeous visuals, and one of the visual scenes I chose put me inside a kind of egg\/womb. Not many people are going to understand this, but I opened up an anime called Haibane Renmei while inside this space and played the first episode near the beginning so I could hear the sound while I was inside this egg. And for all you Haibane Renmei fans out there (probably none... BUT YOU ALL SHOULD BE HAIBANE RENMEI FANS), I basically got as close as I can to being Rakka as she first gains awareness in the world of the Haibane. It was a really beautiful thing to experience, from a really beautiful and emotional anime.\n\nSo yeah, can't do that on PS VR2. And that's why I'll never regret having owned PCVR for a long time.\n\nThat said, PS VR2 is still where it's at for me, and choosing one, I choose you PS VR2!","author_fullname":"t2_kg3ut","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Trying a PS VR2 and HP Reverb G2 (pcvr) side by side.

I moved my headphones over to the respective headset each time as well, because sound affects my enjoyment and feeling of immersion, so I felt it was important to have sound when testing each one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COLOURS AND BLACKS&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first tried PS VR2, booted up Thumper, I exclaimed how amazing the colours were from what I remembered on my G2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still though, I had that doubt in my head if I was remembering clearly, maybe it was just placebo, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it was still a kind of surprise when I booted up Organ Quarter, into a cool area that I had an identical save slot for on both PCVR and PS VR2, and discovered just how much more vibrant the PS VR2 colours really are.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is a MASSIVE difference in colour. And in the blacks. On the G2, the reds were pale, and the blacks were... also pale. Everything felt pale in the G2 after coming out of the PS VR2. It was an impactful area to experience this, surrounded by deep red oscillating organic matter and black abyss stretching before me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same differences were present in The Light Brigade and No Man&amp;#39;s Sky.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference in brightness was also significant and I think contributed to the G2 suddenly feeling rather pale.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind, the G2 is considered to have one of the best LCD displays available for consumer headsets, and also one of the brighter displays.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was impactful experiencing what I already technically knew to be the case on paper and from memory - the PS VR2 has stunning colours, vibrancy, and blacks. And it&amp;#39;s not a subtle difference, it&amp;#39;s a significant, immediately apparent difference.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VISUAL CLARITY&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned above, the G2 is known for having one of the best LCD displays of a consumer headset. Where it really shines is the simple visual clarity. Besides having a resolution that&amp;#39;s slightly higher than PS VR2, it also just has a really nice clear display.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was noticeable to me, and it was also what I already expected again based on my impressions from memory. Especially in the Light Brigade, where there&amp;#39;s lots of fog, the pure visual clarity of the G2 was really pleasant and appealing, better than the PS VR2. Edge to edge clarity was similar to PS VR2, with text in the corner of my eyes reading similarly on both (No Man&amp;#39;s Sky menu). But yeah the G2 just had a particular sharpness to it that the PS VR2 doesn&amp;#39;t quite reach.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, in terms of graphic quality, I don&amp;#39;t have a great test here. For example, No Man&amp;#39;s Sky did look better still on my PC (3070 GPU equivalent) than PS VR2, with less aliasing and probably also lusher grass (planet quality set to ultra). However, it was a stuttery mess (already reduced to 70% resolution). So this is not a fair comparison. I literally cannot play No Man&amp;#39;s Sky on those settings, and in fact the last time I tried to play NMS in VR on my PC I gave up, because I couldn&amp;#39;t get it to look good enough to satisfy me while maintaining performance that was acceptable (I am comfortable with reprojection - but it dips below that into really messy territory).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly in Organ Quarter, I&amp;#39;d say graphically they looked the same except that there was less aliasing on PC. But again I didn&amp;#39;t have it running perfectly smooth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So basically I don&amp;#39;t have a great test for this, and it will be different on different PC hardware anyways, but roughly speaking I&amp;#39;d say the PS VR2 is capable of similar graphical output to a 3070 GPU. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOV&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the tests, this one did surprise me a little bit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On my G2 I have an &amp;#39;FOV mod&amp;#39;, the original face gasket is replaced with an ultra thin gasket. Actually, this is not my preference, I was pressured to make this change because the original face gasket fell apart and to replace it is significantly more expensive than the 3rd party option. (I&amp;#39;ll get into the reasons I don&amp;#39;t like it as much in the next section).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of this ultra thin gasket on the Reverb G2, the FOV of the two headsets seemed functionally identical. I tested multiple times, by trying to go to the same spot in identical games and taking note of what I could see. I&amp;#39;m quite confident both horizontal and vertical FOV were essentially identical.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worth noting also that besides the ultra-thin gasket, the G2 with the standard gasket already has a larger FOV than the Quest 2 or Rift S.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyways, the result is that both the PS VR2 and G2 have pretty good and equivalent FOV potential, with stock PS VR2 presumably being a bit larger than stock G2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comfort&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;#39;s head is different, and it&amp;#39;s clear from reading many VR impressions over the years that a comfortable headset for one person can be super uncomfortable for another. The G2 with the original face gasket was the most comfortable headset, for me, that I ever owned. It&amp;#39;s also a very light headset compared to most, even slightly lighter than PS VR2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PS VR2 is quite comfortable for me. I&amp;#39;ve had some issues where I don&amp;#39;t have it sitting right and it starts to hurt my head, but by now I have it sitting well and can wear it for long periods of time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also my headphones fit a little better over the PS VR2 than the G2 (I don&amp;#39;t use the built-in headphones cuz I&amp;#39;m an audiophile :p), although they don&amp;#39;t fit perfectly over either headset. But yeah good enough on both and slightly better on PS VR2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the 3rd party face gasket, the G2 is unfortunately much less comfortable for me, hence why I prefer the original. I have prescription lenses, and they press slightly against my forehead on the modded G2, and in general I feel like the fit of this gasket just isn&amp;#39;t nearly as comfortable, and the material is not as pleasant. I can still be okay using it but yeah it&amp;#39;s not great and affects my enjoyment.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the PS VR2 is more comfortable than my modded G2, but probably I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a bit less comfy than that original G2 gasket that fit my face perfectly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s more to discuss!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I really love the material of the PS VR2 gasket. When I first put it on I was shocked by how different it felt from any other VR headset I&amp;#39;d put on. I was a bit worried because of the unexpected difference. But I quickly felt that I liked it way more. It&amp;#39;s a very light and loose material that is barely noticed on the face. Every other headset I&amp;#39;ve used, including the G2 whether the modded gasket or original, fits to your face like a glove... not in a good way. It feels like your face is trapped inside there. Not only does it remind me I&amp;#39;m wearing a headset, but it also traps heat and sweat.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now... here is something interesting, that I&amp;#39;m not 100% sure about and isn&amp;#39;t relevant to most people probably, but I think it&amp;#39;s worth mentioning -&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have a skin condition &amp;#39;seborrheic dermatitis&amp;#39; that affects my face. It isn&amp;#39;t fully understood what causes it to flare up but basically it will flair up sometimes, and when it does my face gets itchy and red.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the last few years before I got PS VR2, using the G2 and the Rift S before that, I sometimes felt like it would flare up after being in VR. At first I thought maybe the gasket needed cleaning, and I did deep cleaning on the gasket. But the issue persisted. I started to think it was probably unrelated to the headset - the itching wasn&amp;#39;t even corresponding to where the headset was touching my face.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But as I write this post, my face is itching in a way that it hasn&amp;#39;t since... the last time I used the G2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;#39;t know for sure, but my theory is this:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think that because of the style of headset as discussed above, the way it traps the face, the result is that moisture\/sweat get trapped in my face, affecting even the areas outside of what the headset is actually &amp;#39;trapping&amp;#39;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PS VR2 meanwhile not only lets my face breathe more, but it also has a built-in fan that many people forget about because it&amp;#39;s whisper quiet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, for me at least, it seems that this makes a significant difference. With the PS VR2 I have not had this itching face issue at all, and I suspect it is directly a result of the different headset designs.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So!! In summary, the PS VR2 is significantly more comfortable for me, not just in terms of head pressure (where it falls slightly behind the G2 in its original form), but specifically and especially in terms of breathability. While most people probably won&amp;#39;t be as affected by that as me, I think it should be a consideration for anyone.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Use&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No surprises here, the PS VR2 is way easier for me to use.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think this goes for just about anyone comparing PCVR to PS VR2, but it&amp;#39;s especially true in my case... using the G2 is all kinds of messy, made even messier because of my unbending desire for high fidelity audio.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 does not have a headphone jack (grrrrrRRRRRR) so I run an ultra long headphone cable from my computer to use headphones. There are index-like ear speakers that come with the G2, but as mentioned, I don&amp;#39;t find them to be good enough quality (most people will be happy enough with them. They are probably a bit higher quality than the PS VR2 in-ear headphones, and more comfortable since they don&amp;#39;t even touch your ear, and you don&amp;#39;t have to put them on, but I think they don&amp;#39;t have as much bass as even the little in-ear headphones. Note that I haven&amp;#39;t done a direct comparison, just my impression from memory).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m used to the G2 wmr software back-end by now, but it&amp;#39;s still annoying and sometimes causes problems.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In general there&amp;#39;s a variety of problems that can crop up and require fixing from time to time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 has a heavier and messier cable setup. A single cable leaves the G2 but essentially splits to 3 cables. Two of these go into my computer, the third goes into a power outlet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 also must be powered on\/off from a little power brick in the middle of the cable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 controllers don&amp;#39;t track as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 has absolutely awful passthrough that sometimes I can&amp;#39;t even get to activate, and when it works it&amp;#39;s a low quality &amp;#39;flashlight&amp;#39; passthrough, where you see a small cone of space based on where you point your controller. It&amp;#39;s practically useless.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The G2 does have a nice flip-up design that makes it easy to flip it up and see the world around you without taking off the whole headset. However, with the high quality and easy to use passthrough on PS VR2, this feature on the G2 is essentially redundant and a disadvantage in comparison.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The steamVR interface has come a long way but it&amp;#39;s still much more annoying navigating your computer to access a game than it is to navigate the PS5 menu. When a VR game is on your SteamVR quickmenu it&amp;#39;s easy to open though. Also, obviously the ability to navigate your PC with a PCVR headset is a whole other feature that is not possible on PS VR2. There&amp;#39;s lots of issues with it but yes there are plenty of things you can do with a PCVR headset that you can&amp;#39;t with PS VR2, and that can be cool.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, PS VR2 is way easier to use.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controllers and other headset features&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another obvious one, I won&amp;#39;t spend long on it, but it must be mentioned - PS VR2 has way better controllers. They feel better, they have haptics that are a bajillion times better, adaptive triggers, capacitive touch (the G2 controllers cannot sense any button touching), better tracking, and cooler design! I also absolutely prefer the ring placement on the sense controllers at the back, rather than the traditional VR controller placement that has the ring at the front. Finally hands can be brought together!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, the PS VR2 has eye tracking and headset rumble to boot, which are wonderful features.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, although only rarely used, the PS VR2 is capable of native, full 120Hz gameplay. I believe this is used in a couple games like Thumper and Rez Infinite (I know it was on the original PS VR, it is my guess\/assumption that it is the same on PS VR2). The G2 is only capable of 90Hz max (and like the PS VR2, and any PCVR headset, you are often stuck with reprojection because of performance struggles. The reprojection algorithms differ though. The G2 algorithm I think is even worse than the PS VR2. But the Oculus and Index reprojection systems might be better).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The PS VR2 is not a strict upgrade to the Reverb G2 (and I never thought it was).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, for me, I prefer the PS VR2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the G2 has is the really crystal clear visual clarity. I think as a PC headset specifically, this is particularly valuable, because on PCVR I sometimes am using the headset to navigate my computer or watch movies and the crystal clear visual clarity is a particularly valuable asset in these areas.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do also think it&amp;#39;s particularly impactful in some specific games, like The Light Brigade with all the fog.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, overall and for games in particular, I absolutely prefer the vibrant colours, true blacks, and brightness of the PS VR2. While not as crystal clear, it&amp;#39;s still got good clarity to it and looks wonderful.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s so many other areas where the PS VR2 shines for me. The breathability, the ease of use, the feature set.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What PCVR has is what PCVR will always have, and will probably always have over console. On PCVR I can navigate my computer, watch movies, listen to music with a VR music visualizer,... Today I tried Realms of Flow which I&amp;#39;ve been excited to try (I want this on PS VR2!!!!!!!). It&amp;#39;s a beautiful meditation app. I was presented with absolutely gorgeous visuals, and one of the visual scenes I chose put me inside a kind of egg\/womb. Not many people are going to understand this, but I opened up an anime called Haibane Renmei while inside this space and played the first episode near the beginning so I could hear the sound while I was inside this egg. And for all you Haibane Renmei fans out there (probably none... BUT YOU ALL SHOULD BE HAIBANE RENMEI FANS), I basically got as close as I can to being Rakka as she first gains awareness in the world of the Haibane. It was a really beautiful thing to experience, from a really beautiful and emotional anime.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So yeah, can&amp;#39;t do that on PS VR2. And that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ll never regret having owned PCVR for a long time.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, PS VR2 is still where it&amp;#39;s at for me, and choosing one, I choose you PS VR2!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"5f5cdbfc-af4c-11eb-8b84-0e8f7403ec69","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"16hvhx6","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"hilightnotes","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/16hvhx6\/trying_a_ps_vr2_and_hp_reverb_g2_pcvr_side_by\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/16hvhx6\/trying_a_ps_vr2_and_hp_reverb_g2_pcvr_side_by\/","subreddit_subscribers":222950,"created_utc":1694631420.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"I've been playing VR for 5 years. I love when music and visual come together, and the game that sold me on VR was Thumper. I tried it on PSVR at an airport demo. Later during a June days of play sale I bought the headset. Thumper became one of my favourite and most played games\n\n[Thumper. Text added as part of a video, \\\\\"Spirit of the Beetle\\\\\"](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/ojs25f1kumnb1\/player)\n\nSince then I tried different rhythm games. Beat Saber on PSVR. On PCVR, an old version of Synth Riders. And Audica, OhShape, Pistol Whip. None of them stuck at the time. Only Thumper.\n\nWhen I bought PS VR2 some months ago I downloaded the upgraded version of Beat Saber. Gave it another shot and was pleasantly surprised that I liked it more. But... still it didn't stick.\n\n[Synth Riders \\\\\"Starlight\\\\\" experience](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s4rcgtovsmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fb8f45bc3977f664c3984a095ea7a98771dea64)\n\nI kept reading positive impressions of the 'Synth Riders experiences'. So many voices so eager to recommend it. I've always been interested in unique audio-visual experiences in VR, I've experienced all kinds of VR 'films' and audiovisual experiments. When Synth Riders went on sale I decided that even if I didn't end up liking the core game I would still be glad to play and support the experience tracks. I bought the game, and one experience track individually (Algorithm by Muse).\n\nIt was wonderful. I loved it! From there the purchases kept coming haha. I've spent way more money on Synth Riders DLC than I ever intended \ud83d\ude05 but it's been really valuable to me so I'm glad I went for it.\n\nHow different is playing Synth Riders on PS VR2 than what I tried on PCVR in the past? I'm not really sure. It might be very different, or not that different... But I do feel confident that the vibrant PS VR2 display and excellent haptics contribute. Aesthetic and 'feel' is important to my body.\n\nFast forward a few months, I have over 30 hours in Synth Riders and play it almost every day. The experience tracks are wonderful but it's great playing songs on regular stages too.\n\nIn Synth Riders your hands are orbs, differently coloured. Orbs move toward you corresponding to the two colours, and you have to touch them (no force necessary) with the respective hand. The mechanics are fantastic, allowing the mapping to really get your body into the flow of the song. It works well for all kinds of genres because it has such varied expressive capability. A mapping can get you to do all kinds of motions, tailored to specific rhythms, melodies, vibes...\n\nIt feels so good to play and it really gets my body moving. Tiring my body out in the best way.\n\n[Some mappings in particular are brilliant](https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/u8rddggfumnb1\/player)\n\nSometimes you'll see a funny meme post like \"how it feels to play X VR game\" contrasted with \"what it looks like\". I've seen one for Synth Riders specifically. The joke being that while playing you feel like a badass, but someone watching just sees arms flailing.\n\nIt's funny and of course there's truth to the ridiculousness of it.\n\nBut you know, it DOES feel cool and it IS cool. And, it can even look cool to someone watching!\n\nThe culmination of this post is an attempt at capturing Synth Riders in a way that conveys, visually, how I feel playing.\n\nI want it to look cool because it feels cool. And it IS cool.\n\nI have no green screen. I live in a small studio apartment with white walls. I used my phone camera and crappy webcam to capture two different angles. I spent hours and hours mixing them together with the Synth Riders capture to look good and retain visual clarity.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mgigojq2tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42108c1d069bc49bc43cd919b678cb87e355cc0c\n\n[Two camera angles like a mirror reflect](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gok3j726tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a651922e0b88efeff396a6ebd409515f70c12ca)\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/87kwaev7tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b6929f61e275bf9cd4d94269149d7776075f7350\n\nI hope the result is fun to watch, and encourages more people to pick up this game.\n\nIt's all about motion!!\n\n[excerpt from CURRICULUM OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MARXISM-LENINISM, proving that Synth Riders is a marxist video game \u2728 DISCLAIMER: this message has not been approved by the devs of Synth Riders.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/57stjkl9tmnb1.png?width=608&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc482ba1edab1804038386f1d83c18902bd727d6)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Video Excerpt:**\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/ymonh6i9umnb1\/player\n\nThe **full video, 5 songs**, can be found on my Youtube channel (same username). \n\n**Title:** Synth Riders mix - Madness \/\/ Voidwalkers \/\/ Behemoth \/\/ All Night \/\/ Sunset \/\/ Sleeping Powder\n\nIf I share the link the post is automatically removed.

SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing VR for 5 years. I love when music and visual come together, and the game that sold me on VR was Thumper. I tried it on PSVR at an airport demo. Later during a June days of play sale I bought the headset. Thumper became one of my favourite and most played games&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/ojs25f1kumnb1\/player\"&gt;Thumper. Text added as part of a video, \\&amp;quot;Spirit of the Beetle\\&amp;quot;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then I tried different rhythm games. Beat Saber on PSVR. On PCVR, an old version of Synth Riders. And Audica, OhShape, Pistol Whip. None of them stuck at the time. Only Thumper.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I bought PS VR2 some months ago I downloaded the upgraded version of Beat Saber. Gave it another shot and was pleasantly surprised that I liked it more. But... still it didn&amp;#39;t stick.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/s4rcgtovsmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5fb8f45bc3977f664c3984a095ea7a98771dea64\"&gt;Synth Riders \\&amp;quot;Starlight\\&amp;quot; experience&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept reading positive impressions of the &amp;#39;Synth Riders experiences&amp;#39;. So many voices so eager to recommend it. I&amp;#39;ve always been interested in unique audio-visual experiences in VR, I&amp;#39;ve experienced all kinds of VR &amp;#39;films&amp;#39; and audiovisual experiments. When Synth Riders went on sale I decided that even if I didn&amp;#39;t end up liking the core game I would still be glad to play and support the experience tracks. I bought the game, and one experience track individually (Algorithm by Muse).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful. I loved it! From there the purchases kept coming haha. I&amp;#39;ve spent way more money on Synth Riders DLC than I ever intended \ud83d\ude05 but it&amp;#39;s been really valuable to me so I&amp;#39;m glad I went for it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How different is playing Synth Riders on PS VR2 than what I tried on PCVR in the past? I&amp;#39;m not really sure. It might be very different, or not that different... But I do feel confident that the vibrant PS VR2 display and excellent haptics contribute. Aesthetic and &amp;#39;feel&amp;#39; is important to my body.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few months, I have over 30 hours in Synth Riders and play it almost every day. The experience tracks are wonderful but it&amp;#39;s great playing songs on regular stages too.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Synth Riders your hands are orbs, differently coloured. Orbs move toward you corresponding to the two colours, and you have to touch them (no force necessary) with the respective hand. The mechanics are fantastic, allowing the mapping to really get your body into the flow of the song. It works well for all kinds of genres because it has such varied expressive capability. A mapping can get you to do all kinds of motions, tailored to specific rhythms, melodies, vibes...&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels so good to play and it really gets my body moving. Tiring my body out in the best way.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/u8rddggfumnb1\/player\"&gt;Some mappings in particular are brilliant&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you&amp;#39;ll see a funny meme post like &amp;quot;how it feels to play X VR game&amp;quot; contrasted with &amp;quot;what it looks like&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve seen one for Synth Riders specifically. The joke being that while playing you feel like a badass, but someone watching just sees arms flailing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny and of course there&amp;#39;s truth to the ridiculousness of it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But you know, it DOES feel cool and it IS cool. And, it can even look cool to someone watching!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The culmination of this post is an attempt at capturing Synth Riders in a way that conveys, visually, how I feel playing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want it to look cool because it feels cool. And it IS cool.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have no green screen. I live in a small studio apartment with white walls. I used my phone camera and crappy webcam to capture two different angles. I spent hours and hours mixing them together with the Synth Riders capture to look good and retain visual clarity.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mgigojq2tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42108c1d069bc49bc43cd919b678cb87e355cc0c\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/mgigojq2tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42108c1d069bc49bc43cd919b678cb87e355cc0c&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/gok3j726tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4a651922e0b88efeff396a6ebd409515f70c12ca\"&gt;Two camera angles like a mirror reflect&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/87kwaev7tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b6929f61e275bf9cd4d94269149d7776075f7350\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/87kwaev7tmnb1.png?width=1920&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=b6929f61e275bf9cd4d94269149d7776075f7350&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hope the result is fun to watch, and encourages more people to pick up this game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s all about motion!!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/57stjkl9tmnb1.png?width=608&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bc482ba1edab1804038386f1d83c18902bd727d6\"&gt;excerpt from CURRICULUM OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MARXISM-LENINISM, proving that Synth Riders is a marxist video game \u2728 DISCLAIMER: this message has not been approved by the devs of Synth Riders.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_____________________________________________________&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Excerpt:&lt;\/strong&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/ymonh6i9umnb1\/player\"&gt;https:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/16fw5em\/video\/ymonh6i9umnb1\/player&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;full video, 5 songs&lt;\/strong&gt;, can be found on my Youtube channel (same username). &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title:&lt;\/strong&gt; Synth Riders mix - Madness \/\/ Voidwalkers \/\/ Behemoth \/\/ All Night \/\/ Sunset \/\/ Sleeping Powder&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I share the link the post is automatically removed.

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Crossfire: Sierra Squad on PSVR2, especially if you are looking for a Time Crisis style arcade action game with co-op.\n\nIt is a first-person shooter game that features 13 solo campaign missions with a story to tell, 50 squad campaign missions which can be played solo or 2P co-op, and a Horde Mode for up to 4P co-op with leaderboards. There is also expectation of DLC that will be adding more Horde Mode maps sometime in the future.\n\nThe game provides a number of settings to let you customize things according to your VR comfort &amp; gameplay preferences. The title screen doubles as the tutorial area letting you get comfortable with how the controls \/ weapons work. It is probably a good idea to spend a little bit of time with the 3 separate short overlay-instruction based tutorials the game provides to get comfortable with how to use weapons, special weapons, grenades, and health restore. While playing you have unlimited ammo for your primary weapon as well as grenades and health restore item, but the grenades and health restore item are on a cool down between uses. You can change weapon hands dynamically. You can pick up and drop weapons you find within missions. You can also store weapons by attaching them to your body (ex: storing sniper rifle you found over shoulder). Your primary weapon can't be dropped and auto-attaches to front of your body whenever you let go of it.\n\nI think the graphics are good and sound in particular is very good, but I don't think the game is using PSVR2 haptic feedback as well as it should. I can tell when I am taking hits, but I think it is from audio-visual feedback, not headset haptics. I can tell when I am firing weapon due to audio-visual feedback, but I can't specifically identify haptic feedback. Not even when using the health item or pulling grenade pin. The game is making use of resistive triggers and sniper in particular lets you stabilize your aim to make shots easier by partially holding trigger before fully depressing to take the shots.\n\nYou start the game in an arcade mode, but after completing the single player campaign, you will unlock realism mode which will make both you and all enemies have much less health which will drastically change the way you have to play to successfully complete the missions. The game features a progression system which allows players to earn XP and money by completing missions and objectives. You can use the earned money to purchase new weapons and add-ons to upgrade the weapons and modify your load-outs. As you complete missions, you always have to return to the title screen to choose what you will play next. Interestingly, as you do that the game will suggest or even bump up the difficulty for you for your next mission.\n\nThe missions themselves take you through both indoor and outdoor environments, and I think they generally get bigger \/ longer as you get further into the game. They all seem to feature small arenas from where you will fight (with sufficient cover) setting up set piece action moments before you can proceed to next area. The set piece moments will encourage use of sniper or rocket launchers and challenge you with a variety of different types of enemies including flying drones and helicopters. It also features boss enemies that are named. The story of the game is told using dialog over radio mostly while you are in combat. \n\nThe only bug I encountered is starting the first solo mission can sometimes jam on the theater mode text intro loading screen. If this happens, you can either restart the game or use the options button and try to use option to return to title screen (as covered in my gameplay video). The other missions didn't have this issue for me, so this is issue I encountered (multiple times) is specific to episode 1.\n\nThe game isn't what I imagined it would be based on it's trailers, but what it is (something much more like Time Crisis), is still a good time for me.

While playing you have unlimited ammo for your primary weapon as well as grenades and health restore item, but the grenades and health restore item are on a cool down between uses. You can change weapon hands dynamically. You can pick up and drop weapons you find within missions. You can also store weapons by attaching them to your body (ex: storing sniper rifle you found over shoulder). Your primary weapon can&amp;#39;t be dropped and auto-attaches to front of your body whenever you let go of it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the graphics are good and sound in particular is very good, but I don&amp;#39;t think the game is using PSVR2 haptic feedback as well as it should. I can tell when I am taking hits, but I think it is from audio-visual feedback, not headset haptics. I can tell when I am firing weapon due to audio-visual feedback, but I can&amp;#39;t specifically identify haptic feedback. Not even when using the health item or pulling grenade pin. The game is making use of resistive triggers and sniper in particular lets you stabilize your aim to make shots easier by partially holding trigger before fully depressing to take the shots.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You start the game in an arcade mode, but after completing the single player campaign, you will unlock realism mode which will make both you and all enemies have much less health which will drastically change the way you have to play to successfully complete the missions. The game features a progression system which allows players to earn XP and money by completing missions and objectives. You can use the earned money to purchase new weapons and add-ons to upgrade the weapons and modify your load-outs. As you complete missions, you always have to return to the title screen to choose what you will play next. Interestingly, as you do that the game will suggest or even bump up the difficulty for you for your next mission.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The missions themselves take you through both indoor and outdoor environments, and I think they generally get bigger \/ longer as you get further into the game. They all seem to feature small arenas from where you will fight (with sufficient cover) setting up set piece action moments before you can proceed to next area. The set piece moments will encourage use of sniper or rocket launchers and challenge you with a variety of different types of enemies including flying drones and helicopters. It also features boss enemies that are named. The story of the game is told using dialog over radio mostly while you are in combat. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only bug I encountered is starting the first solo mission can sometimes jam on the theater mode text intro loading screen. If this happens, you can either restart the game or use the options button and try to use option to return to title screen (as covered in my gameplay video). The other missions didn&amp;#39;t have this issue for me, so this is issue I encountered (multiple times) is specific to episode 1.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game isn&amp;#39;t what I imagined it would be based on it&amp;#39;s trailers, but what it is (something much more like Time Crisis), is still a good time for me. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/IObSa-M8Z9FBD-rqPOYmhh7PiqZO_af-DQINR8PFapQ.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ed193b2b6da3e7985f7450a42d722e8459e9976b","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/IObSa-M8Z9FBD-rqPOYmhh7PiqZO_af-DQINR8PFapQ.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b12c407c360d57f4185dcdc7777326dc8cef230e","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/IObSa-M8Z9FBD-rqPOYmhh7PiqZO_af-DQINR8PFapQ.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c9b2e4b92ad5673927a9c3561a720a30e42b2f9","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/IObSa-M8Z9FBD-rqPOYmhh7PiqZO_af-DQINR8PFapQ.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f122455240719a179f4fcdb014c362488e4ad095","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"fHZfqTK5iXb9oJl6Bai_RpXpS4ohWQ4MORS5kKx6moI"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"165ee6e","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/165ee6e\/crossfire_sierra_squad_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/165ee6e\/crossfire_sierra_squad_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":222548,"created_utc":1693401197.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"So only when I first put on vr (not in any app) it shows the room fine.

I\u2019m just genuinely looking for some insights before I make my decision. \n\nFor some context, I purchased the PS VR2 yesterday after hearing rave reviews of the No Man\u2019s Sky update. I used to play a ton of NMS from launch through many of the updates, but eventually phased out feeling like I either needed a fundamental change to the AI and\/or flight model, or to switch to VR to experience the game\u2019s scale in stereoscopic 3D to draw me back in. Most of my experience in VR is with my Quest 2 (not connected to a PC, as I don\u2019t have a gaming PC). \n\nAfter spending a day with the device and the game, I found it fell below my expectations. Here are my questions:\n\n- I heard that the clarity of the PS VR2 is incredible, and assumed it would be miles ahead of my Quest 2. Surprisingly, when in the PS menu screens it didn\u2019t seem significantly improved. I haven\u2019t done an A\/B comparison yet, but there was still haloing in areas of high contrast and generally blurriness anywhere but the small sweet spot. Is there some additional calibration or settings I should muck with? Currently it feels much more lateral than I expected (though obviously the horse power is much improved). \n\n- Related to my last question, the right lens is much clearer than the left. I would have thought maybe the dial that sets the distance between eyes would help with this, but that didn\u2019t fix it. Anyone else experience this? Does anything help resolve it? I did clean the lens so that shouldn\u2019t be the problem. It more feels like the left side sits just a bit too high or low, and the sweet spot is very finicky. I never experienced this with the Quest 2. \n\n- Specific to NMS, even though I trust there has been a noticeable improvement to the clarity of the image, there is a substantial hit to the overall image fidelity in the current VR mode on PS VR2, yeah? I feel silly asking this, because of course it\u2019s going to take a noticeable hit when having to render the game from two viewpoints simultaneously at a high frame rate, but my experience yesterday felt like rewinding time back to what the game looked like closer to launch. Ground textures were pixilated up close, ground draw distance was greatly reduced, pop-in was noticeably increased, etc. In the end, the difference between the VR mode and non-VR is a noticeable jump, correct? I find the fidelity hit kind of reduces the impact of the scale of everything in 3D, though it\u2019s very possible that I\u2019m on ugly planets. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be my favorites even on a TV screen. \n\n- What\u2019s the best game to get a sense of the real capabilities of the headset? Call do the Mountain seems like it comes up a lot. How about RE 8? I don\u2019t want to invest much more in something I might return, but maybe trying something out other than NMS would be a good idea. \n\nThose are all of questions for now. Apologies if this seemed negative.  There\u2019s a lot that I like about the device, and I\u2019ve always love NMS and greatly respect the devs. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if I can do more to improve my experience because it wasn\u2019t an inexpensive device. \n\nThanks in advance for the insights.","author_fullname":"t2_ta2j91","gilded":0,"title":"Considering returning my PS VR2.

You essentially spawn armies of robotic \"gardeners\" to mimic your actions to get certain tasks done, like harvest certain plants and throw the fruit into various contraptions in order to produce fuel or generate other items, which allow you to progress through the nonlinear series of rooms.  It's really a lot of fun, and for each room the bar to progress is pretty manageable but there are achievements for completing tasks very efficiently, so there's an incentive to using your noggin.  The gardeners repeat *everything* you do with your head and arms, so if you pump your fist into the air to celebrate a well-timed operation, the robot will also do that every time it repeats the action -- it can be pretty funny!\n\nThe setting is a kind of surrealistic science fiction universe, and the art direction is quite good.

It starts off silent whenever you enter a room, and ramps up as you add more and more gardeners to complete a task.  Really effective.

How Supermassive managed to fail in almost every aspect of a 'spiritual sequel' when they previously smashed it out of the park on their first try is beyond me. Here's every bit of feedback I have (long post incoming). Feel free to disagree.\n\nTHE GUN PLAY\n\nThe enemy encounters feel incredibly cheap, and sparingly placed. You're shooting static targets just as much as enemies along the areas of track where NOTHING happens. The pacing is consistently terrible, so terrible that you can easily predict when enemies are about to show up (or not). The bullet sponge enemies haven't been improved either, apparently they added some hit reactionson the last update, but I didn't notice any meaningful difference.\n\nTHE ROLLERCOASTER ELEMENT\n\nAll the fun things about a rollercoaster include the dips, twists, speed, height and drops - the anticipation and 'seeing' what's coming can also a thrill. Rush of Blood had many instances of this. Switchback? It's almost exclusively a ground level, slow, straight line (that occasionally bends). You enter an area, move slowly through it, and then go through a door to the next area. It has a couple of drops and speed moments. The rollercoaster element is so woefully under used.\n\nTHE HORROR\n\nRush of Blood had lots of scary or unexpected moments in pretty much every level, and it wasn't just jump scares. It built on anticipation and the unexpected and it had good creature design. A good example is the level with spiders, where all of a sudden they invaded your personal space in the cart. There's nothing even close to this in Switchback. It has a couple of moments throughout the entire game - but even these are heavily signposted (especially the moments is stupidly takes your guns away). This in part is due to....\n\nTHE ANIMATION\n\nIts bad, laughably so, but it's not just cheap, it takes away the element of ANY surprise. You can easily see what an enemy is about to do because the animation cycles are incredibly limited. If you see something that might be scary, or might do something, don't worry it won't - that would have meant they had to animate it, and they didn't.\n\nTHE BOSS FIGHTS\n\nI liked the boss fight with Du'Met! (Devil In Me level). Thats it. Everything else you've seen before, done much better. To be fair the boss fights in Rush of Blood weren't great either but they were executed much better.\n\nTHE 'PUZZLES' \/ CHARACTER 'SAVES'\n\nIn theory these are a great idea - its just not implemented very well and just add to the already terrible pacing. For example, its really not fun to (very) slowly move around a circular piece of track while looking for specific targets. In some cases, if you fail, its an insta death and you have to start moving around that very slow area again.\n\nGAME LENGTH\n\nThe general feedback from Rush of Blood is that people wanted more! It was a perfect party game that could be passed around and demo'd in short bursts and you can high score chase in 10 minute slots! It just needed more levels! Thats not how supermassive interpreted it for Switchback, instead they have artificially increased the playtime by stretching out each level length to half an hour of bad pacing. Its really boring to watch and demo if you have friends over while you wait (especially because it's not scary and has long lengths of nothing happening). It's one of the those instances where less it more.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nPainful, and the antagonist is like a children's pantomime villain. You'd think that Supermassive might want to promote the games the levels are based on, or at least give some context to the series. Nope. It was literally just so they could reuse the assets.\n\nSo, did I like anything about it? Yeah, it had some good ideas, its just that they were all underdeveloped or badly implemented. It also looks much better than the terrible state it launched in when they tried to say it was a 'bug'.

I do not want 500 messages of the \"check for that cord behind the left-eye panel\" we have already done that. Thank you!\n\n**The Start:** My stepdad was out in town the other day and while in Game Stop he bought a PSVR 2 (New, was sealed all over, and appeared unopened - It also said it was New on the shelf). He really wanted one for a long time as he loves racing games and Beatsaber and he's always wanted to play his games in VR. He's had a PS5 and has a lot of fun with it but he only really bought it in hopes that the VR would come out. So long as we can get things fixed and working he is looking into buying a driving set along with it. So far, however, we have been having frequent problems with Sony products and he is about done with Sony altogether.\n\n**The VR:** So we bought it and hooked it up. It was working great for a day and a half. We played Beatsaber then he played some of his racing games. Roughly the quality you'd expect for a VR that is about the same price as the entire console.\n\nHowever, a day and a half in he was playing some Beatsaber and it suddenly booted him out and his headset was unresponsive. We looked online and did plenty of troubleshooting (we are relatively competent with technology). We sadly could not solve the issue even through Sony's website directions or any other online post. We checked the power cord under the lens, it's plugged in and isn't an issue. We have done resets, the many different methods of \"turning it off and back on again,\" power cycling, etc. etc. The controllers turn on and connect to the console. The headset shows a red light at the power button. When the PS5 tells us to turn on the headset via the power button, it flashes white for a few seconds and suddenly goes back to red with no change on the screen. It is plugged in using the cords it came with and we plugged it in where the instructions directed.\n\nI will be going to my friend's house within the next 2 days to plug it into his PS5 and see if anything changes. If it does I'll bring it back home and see if it magically works again. If it proceeds to not work, I am either going to ask for a replacement if the wait time isn't too long or I am going to return it and buy it elsewhere if that ends up being quicker.\n\n**Extra Questions:** With all the information above, does anyone have any other suggestions or perhaps an idea as to why it does this as it seems pretty common and significant enough for Sony to not simply overlook it? Does it seem more like a software issue, hardware issue, or both?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n **UPDATE:**\n\nI tried the PSVR 2 at my buddy's place, it worked on his console. Went back home and hooked it up to my PS5, and it worked. I do not know why it stopped working at the time. My guess was that the internals were overheating or something and it was preventing itself from turning on because of it.\n\nWould be nice if at least the HUD had a warning when turning it on and THEN turn itself off instead of just shutting down without context or anything - it should've at least popped up on the TV Screen and the VR Headset HUD that it was overheated and to wait a period of time before launching it again if that was the issue.\n\nSONY - Get to work on making that a thing so that people don't think their PSVR 2 is faulty and return\/replace it. Make a pop-up notification on the headset and TV that it is overheated and needs to cool down (if that is the issue).

It's probably not comprehensive, but it's a long read regardless, let me know if you think of anything. \n\nBy the way, if anyone at Rockstar reads this and thinks \"Boy, that feller would sure make a good VR Mechanics Advisor\" then message me, and I'll send you my deets, though I'd also happily accept just scrubbing the floors of your Dundee office.\n\n# Intro\n\nRight now, there is a great big hole in the VR market where an old west game should be. Revolvers, Repeaters, Horses and Holdups, all in a big open world, with one of the best stories and soundtracks present in gaming. I believe, with just the right tweaking, RDR can made made into an incomparably great VR title, and I'm going to show you how each gameplay mechanic should be translated to VR.\n\n# Movement\n\nWhen playing first-person in GTA V and RDR, you'll notice that your head rotation is tied to what direction your moving, it takes some getting used to compared to most other FPS, where your character doesn't turn when moving left to right, but strafes. There's no way we can keep the same system when adapting the game to VR, so naturally strafe will always be on, so the player can only ever sprint in a straight line, which shouldn't be an issue as the player can't fire when sprinting anyway, or more specifically if the player fires when sprinting, they come out of sprint.\n\nA great deal of VR games tend to come with teleport options, which could theoretically be viable, but may add a not insignificant portion of development time as you map out everywhere the player can and cannot teleport. As with RE8 VR, it would be best to keep the game as Free Move. As for whether or not the player has a body, it seems best that they should have one, considering the game has unlockable outfits. However, an option to enable hands only for those that prefer it might be prudent. A lot of work will have to go into making sure animations work in VR, and for certain animations like skinning animals, like RE4 VR it might be best to view these from a 3rd person perspective. Other animations though might have to be dropped entirely. Kill animations, for one, when the in the base game a player runs up to an enemy and performs a special kill animation would have to be scrapped, as the player would simply do this themselves.\n\n# Horsin' Around\n\nNow, for the important part - horses. There should be a few accessibility options in regards to them, firstly being mounting the horse. With comfort options for the horse turned off, you would simply experience the animation for climbing onto the horse, and while the camera may vertically move, the player themselves should handle rotating to face the right direction. For controlling the horse, another few options could be available. There's the full immersion mode, where pulling the reign to the left goes left, and right goes right, and where snapping the reigns increases speed, and pulling them back decreases it, or have it be purely button and analogue based, with motion playing no part. While the motion can be done with two hands, and should also be doable with one, so the player can shoot their sidearm as well. However, the horse should begin to auto-run when a primary is pulled out, maintaining a middle speed. With full-body on, it's important that John's torso should pivot with the player as the turn to shoot enemies in the saddle, though the tricky part is how much to allow the player to rotate in the saddle. Perhaps adding a hard limit to how much John's body can turn in each direction is the solution, and not allowing the player to aim further than say, 190 degrees, with perhaps a red indicator where they're aiming showing the issue. Whether or not to implement this with the non-full body mode is debatable too, and it'd simply need to be tested first hand to see.\n\n# UI\n\nThe best way to do UI in VR games is to be as diegetic as is reasonable. As in, minimise the amount of floating menus. For example, instead of opening an inventory screen, it would be better to instead pull a satchel from your hip, and see your inventory physically in your satchel, similar to Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. For your map, it should also be a physical object you hold in your hands, and you can simply poke your finger at points on a map to set your waypoint. As for waypoint guidance, a compass should be in order. When on a horse or carriage, it should be attached to the saddle, or be able to be pulled out of John's breast pocket, and it would follow the pathing toward your waypoint. Perhaps with the pull of a trigger, you can have it switch between different waypoint targets, with a symbol on the compass indicating which one it's pointing too. Maybe you could have an option to have it permanently attached to your wrist in the options.\n\nOrdinarily, you can see how much ammo is in your weapon, though I feel as though this could be optional, being another part of the VR options. After all, if you can't keep track of six bullets in a revolver, maybe you were never cut out to be an outlaw. Still, it's important to have the option to turn on or off UI elements.\n\n# Controls\n\nWith VR controllers, there are at face value less options than even with a typical modern gamepad, due to the loss of the d-pad, which RDR makes use of. However, with motion controls you can have context-sensitive actions, most commonly being hovering your hand at your hip for a sidearm, and over the shoulder for your primary. This control scheme is commonly used simply because it is natural, and feels right, and can be applied to more than just weapons. Whistling for a horse, for example, wouldn't be a dedicated button, but instead raising a hand to your mouth and pressing the interact button. Still, radial menus are baked into RDR to begin with, and are a natural fit for VR, so the option to choose between them should be present.\n\n# Dead-Eye\n\nOne of the stand out features of RDR is also one of the features that fits most naturally for VR, and that's Dead Eye. Slo-mo is welcome in any VR game, due to they more physically demanding nature of VR. As for implementing it, it shouldn't be too difficult at all, and could even retain the manual\/automatic divide between the two modes. Activating Dead Eye would enable your shooting reticule (which you can turn on or off ordinarily) and, if you have it on automatic, functions just like the base game, marking targets on enemies bodies as the reticule hovers over it. Once you hit trigger, your hand automatically snaps to each target point and blasts it. Manual aiming may well be preferable for VR players, as they'll use the interact button to mark spots to shoot on an enemy, or can simply fire without marking points to shoot. To minimise the overpowered nature of being able to shoot freely in slow motion, having John's hand actually have to catch up with the players actual location would be a good way to balance it, otherwise John's final fight may have gone differently.\n\n# Duelling with Dual-ing\n\nNow for something trickier, and that's whether or not dual-wielding revolvers should be present in the game. While you can do so in RDR2, you could not in the original. However. It would feel like a massive missed opportunity to not add this feature, as it is a staple of the genre to have twin six-shooters, and it quite simply feels cool to do, and when a game can make you feel cool, it's done it's job. Now, for reloading, most games need you to holster a weapon to reload the other, but After The Fall and Blood &amp; Truth are both VR games that allow you to pick up ammo while you still have a gun in hand, which I believe helps keep up the momentum of combat much more so than having to holster your offhand weapon in the middle of a firefight. As for purchasing this second secondary, perhaps a discount could be added for the second one, a sort of 50% 2-for-1-and-a-half deal exclusive to the VR version. Those wishing to have the vanilla experience of one sidearm at a time can simply choose not to opt for two, so I believe it's an important feature to add. Speaking of reloading...\n\n# Reloading\n\nThere should be 2 options when it comes to reloading - automatic reloading, where John Marston does all the hard work, and manual, where you have to get ready to flick your wrist a lot to open your chamber. The most important change will be having actual weapon animations for reloading, as the original skips over that part for a number of weapons, which I can't blame them for, considering it's a third person title, however for VR it'd be an obvious oversight not to overhaul weapon animations. Importantly, since revolvers don't all reload the same way, the player suddenly has something else to consider when choosing their faithful sidearm - how efficiently they can reload it. In the base game, the Cattleman Revolver and the Shcofield have appropriately different animations, the first being cylinder-fed via a chamber, and the second being a break-action revolver, both of which function quite differently from the pistols in the game like the Volcanic and the High Power pistols. Instead of the player just looking at raw stats, now they have to contend with the feel of the gun, which is very important.\n\nIt's not just pistols, either, but a wide variety of repeaters, bolt actions, shotguns, and even the muzzle-fed blunderbuss. All of them will basically have to be remade from the ground up to fit into VR, but it will absolutely be worth it, as immersion is the name of the game. Repeaters especially should feel right to shoot, as there are 5 different repeaters in the game. Lever action rifles are a rare treat in VR games, so to have a veritable buffet of them is wonderful, but only if they are done correctly. Cocking the repeater has to feel right, and your aim down the sights should be minimally affected by the action, so that players can stay targeted on enemies while they fire. The left hand should be an important anchor point. However, if you want to add an extra cool feature, one-handed cocking of a lever action, a la Terminator 2 would be very welcome. If that feature is added, though, it will absolutely be mandatory to add a lever-action shotgun naturally modelled after the Winchester Model 1887 (shortened stock of course), and I will not allow the game to release until it has it.\n\n# ADS\n\nNaturally, the iron sights for weapons will be updated to be accurate seeing as the models for the weapons would be remade anyway, but more important is the scopes. VR games can go a few different routes with it, with vignettes and 2D video layering and whatever the hell Borderlands 2 VR was doing, but I believe Pavlov and Contractors have done sniper scopes quite well, and is a very natural and unobtrusive way, making it feel like you're simply looking through a real sniper scope. I'm sure a lot of hard work goes into making it feel natural, but it pays off. It may only be for two weapons, but it's important nonetheless.\n\n# Special Weapons\n\nIn John Marston's Arsenal you have some special weapons, primarily the Lasso and the Throwing Knives. These will be tricky to adapt to VR, but getting them right would be a big win. For the lasso, I feel the best way to have it work would be a soft-lock system using where the player is looking for who it targets. The player would whirl the lasso above their head to increase the distance they can throw it, and flick their arm forward to actually do so. Then, they could do pulling actions to drag the culprit toward them, and finally use the interact button to play the hogtieing animation. Or, if you want to go the extra mile, have a small motion-control minigame for tying up an enemy where you have to wrap the rope around their arms and legs.\n\nThen, there are the throwing knives. There are a few ways to handle it - first is no help whatsoever. Simply have all aiming and power be in the literal hands of the player. However, in the interest of feeling cool, I believe a soft-locking system should be in place. Again, it should use where the player is looking for it's target finding. However, the homing aspect of the knives should be fairly minimal, and the player should have to take into account whether or not the enemy is moving, and in which direction. If the enemy is running right, then they should still have to lead the shot. Basically, you shouldn't be able to throw the knife to your left and have it zoom into a cowpoke's skull, the player should still feel as though they did that, and that they're just that good.\n\nThe knives aren't the only throwing weapons, though, the player also has Dynamite and Fire Bottles. Pulling one of these out should not automatically light them, instead the left (or right hand, if player desires) should be holding a flip-lighter which they can use to light the fire bottle or dynamite with. Naturally, the player is going to want to throw the dynamite pretty soon, lest they explode. Now, I think these particular throwables should not have a soft-locking system, instead being entirely player-driven for where they are thrown. However, an option to have a fixed throw, with an arc indicator, should probably be in the options for those with a weak pitching arm. The player can still throw them without lighting them, and instead opt to ignite them by shooting them, which will admittedly feel cooler, Dead Eye being a big help on that front.\n\n# Melee\n\nAs for melee, the player has a few options, namely the Hunting Knife, and Fists. When it comes to the knife, RE4 VR for the Quest 2 applied the knife very well, having a soft cooldown for how fast the knife could be slashed, as well as a minimum speed the player had to reach with it before it actually did damage, which I believe should be applied to RDR VR. The game also has knife blocking built in, so the player simply making the motion of holding the knife close in front of them should put them in the blocking state. As for fists. I feel only minimal amount of overhaul is even necessary in regards to fist combat. Naturally, there would have to be a cooldown system in place to stop the player throwing hands too fast. Blocking would be as simply as raising your arms in front of yourself, though grappling is where it gets tricky. I believe there should be a visual indicator in the enemy's legs for the player to either physically grab, or press the Interact button to start the grab. Then, the player (for lack of a better word) mounts the enemy, and can wail on their face for a bit.\n\n# Player Ragdolling\n\nNow, one thing you definitely don't want to do to a player in VR is ragdoll them. If you do, you'll be getting a lot of angry, vomit-stained letters from players. However. Physics play an important part of the gameplay, and John is just as susceptible to falling on his ass as the enemies are. So, I believe in the VR Comfort options, the players ability to be ragdolled should be present. When it's off, the player is simply never ragdolled, though this might disable some animal mauling situations, but they can still attack the player til they die anyway. Now, with the ragdolling on, there should still be limitations on movement, namely, the camera movement. There should be no pitch and yaw, or even world rotation when the player is ragdolled, instead only vertical movement. A vignette should be present showing Marston is stunned, and can't take action until he gets back up. Perhaps, though, in the cheats section, you could add a spew-tastic full ragdoll mode, pitch-and-y-all.\n\n# Minigames\n\nRDR has no shortage of ways to while away time in the Old West, like five-finger fillet, horseshoes, and arm wrestling, and that's not to mention the gambling on games like Blackjack, Liars Dice, and good ol' fashion Poker. All of these should be adapted to fit VR uniquely, to feel like a complete port. The non-gambling games have the most work to do - Five Finger Fillet for example, should turn from a button-memorising game to a motion-and-timing game. Now, you'll actually have to do it yourself. Follow the same pattern as the opponent, and hit each mark before the time ends, or you stab your hand. As per the base game, 3 tries per round. Horseshoes is simpler, purely being a physics game of getting the horseshoes closest to the stake, though in VR it'll definitely feel more natural, probably easier too. Arm wrestling is tricky, however, you could theoretically go with button mashing and motion controls, but button mashing a one handed controller while trying precision movements might be a bit much. However, it could be made into a buzz-wire type of game, where you have to make your controller follow a precise path in order to progress. which increased difficulties reducing the size of the path while increasing it's erratic-ness.\n\nAs for the gambling games, keeping them as motion-controlled as possible would be ideal, to retain immersion. For poker, motion controls should work well, such as tapping the table for \"call\", or placing your cards face-up for folding. Hell, you could go one step further and have the player physically deal the cards when it's their turn. Perhaps add in a chastisement from the other players for messing around with the cards, or making a mistake, upon which the cards would reset back to the deck the player is holding. For calling or raising, the player would actually pick up the amount of chips they want to bet, with appropriate HUD indicators for where to put them, or how much is being picked up. Blackjack would use similar motion features, but you could perhaps go one step further by adding voice controls for \"hit\" and \"stand\". As for Liars Dice, you would naturally physically shake the cup yourself, but perhaps a new UI element would be needed for calling out how many dice there are, such as a piece of paper where the player touches it to control how many dice they're calling out, and what their number is. For calling out when someone is a \"liar\", perhaps slamming your fist on the table would be appropriate.\n\n# Online\n\nWhile having the online isn't entirely necessary, it would be very welcome, and naturally you'd only be playing with other VR players. Dead Eye would be similarly nerfed, as it is in base online, being used entirely for marking and auto-shooting, without slow motion. The game would naturally launch with the Online DLC expansions that released. Heck, if the game is successful enough, perhaps new content could be added, lord knows Take Two will take any opportunity the can get for further monetisation, but if it results in more content then it could well be worth it. Co-op missions especially will be a big draw, especially considering playing for short bursts is well suited to VR.\n\n# Graphics\/Platforms\n\nWith word of a Remaster for RDR floating around, it's tempting to use the remaster as a basis for a VR port. However there may come a benefit to going with the original - performance. Performance is king in VR, so using the original as a basis instead of the remaster may be preferable, though it will come down to what platforms the port is planning to release on. PC, obviously, and PSVR2 has the power as well, however the Quest 2 doesn't seem terribly viable, even though RDR is 13 years old at this point, it's still an open-world game with detailed physics in the form of the Euphoria System. However, the Quest 3 might just be able to handle the base game running in VR, especially if some optimisations are made. Regardless of whether or not the Remaster is used as a base, certain models will have to be upgraded. The player's weapons are the priority, of course, and should be - as mentioned prior - remade from the ground up, while maintaining the style of the original weapons of course. John Marston's player model should be upgraded as well, as polygonal, mid-textured hands aren't a great look in VR.\n\n# Cutscenes\n\nDue to the way most in-game cutscenes are handled in games like this, being able to see outside the field of vision you normally can in cutscenes can be quite immersion breaking, as you'll often see a lack of animations on characters where they didn't need to be animated, so the best option would be for a 3D theatre-mode cutscene. Heck, you could take the \"theatre mode\" part literally, and have the player actually sit in a theatre to watch the cutscene. Still, having other options may be possible, depending on how completely the scenes are animated, and players who don't play with full-body on will still get to see how John looks in his spiffy outfits, so they still have reason to unlock them.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo tl;dr it, with the right amount of elbow grease, RDR has the capacity to be one of the best VR games out there, with excellent depth, immersion, and accessibility that could absolutely be a system seller for whatever platforms it chooses to call home, and I wouldn't complain if I had to pay a full \u00a360 to play this title.","author_fullname":"t2_db3zd","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Theoretical Pitch for Red Dead Redemption VR Port","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Fluff"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":false,"name":"t3_152f2qu","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","upvote_ratio":0.43,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":0,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Fluff","can_mod_post":false,"score":0,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1689630368.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made a post a week or two ago about how great a VR port of RDR would be, so I went ahead and outlined how I believe each mechanic could be translated. It&amp;#39;s probably not comprehensive, but it&amp;#39;s a long read regardless, let me know if you think of anything. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, if anyone at Rockstar reads this and thinks &amp;quot;Boy, that feller would sure make a good VR Mechanics Advisor&amp;quot; then message me, and I&amp;#39;ll send you my deets, though I&amp;#39;d also happily accept just scrubbing the floors of your Dundee office.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Intro&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right now, there is a great big hole in the VR market where an old west game should be. Revolvers, Repeaters, Horses and Holdups, all in a big open world, with one of the best stories and soundtracks present in gaming. I believe, with just the right tweaking, RDR can made made into an incomparably great VR title, and I&amp;#39;m going to show you how each gameplay mechanic should be translated to VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Movement&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When playing first-person in GTA V and RDR, you&amp;#39;ll notice that your head rotation is tied to what direction your moving, it takes some getting used to compared to most other FPS, where your character doesn&amp;#39;t turn when moving left to right, but strafes. There&amp;#39;s no way we can keep the same system when adapting the game to VR, so naturally strafe will always be on, so the player can only ever sprint in a straight line, which shouldn&amp;#39;t be an issue as the player can&amp;#39;t fire when sprinting anyway, or more specifically if the player fires when sprinting, they come out of sprint.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great deal of VR games tend to come with teleport options, which could theoretically be viable, but may add a not insignificant portion of development time as you map out everywhere the player can and cannot teleport. As with RE8 VR, it would be best to keep the game as Free Move. As for whether or not the player has a body, it seems best that they should have one, considering the game has unlockable outfits. However, an option to enable hands only for those that prefer it might be prudent. A lot of work will have to go into making sure animations work in VR, and for certain animations like skinning animals, like RE4 VR it might be best to view these from a 3rd person perspective. Other animations though might have to be dropped entirely. Kill animations, for one, when the in the base game a player runs up to an enemy and performs a special kill animation would have to be scrapped, as the player would simply do this themselves.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Horsin&amp;#39; Around&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, for the important part - horses. There should be a few accessibility options in regards to them, firstly being mounting the horse. With comfort options for the horse turned off, you would simply experience the animation for climbing onto the horse, and while the camera may vertically move, the player themselves should handle rotating to face the right direction. For controlling the horse, another few options could be available. There&amp;#39;s the full immersion mode, where pulling the reign to the left goes left, and right goes right, and where snapping the reigns increases speed, and pulling them back decreases it, or have it be purely button and analogue based, with motion playing no part. While the motion can be done with two hands, and should also be doable with one, so the player can shoot their sidearm as well. However, the horse should begin to auto-run when a primary is pulled out, maintaining a middle speed. With full-body on, it&amp;#39;s important that John&amp;#39;s torso should pivot with the player as the turn to shoot enemies in the saddle, though the tricky part is how much to allow the player to rotate in the saddle. Perhaps adding a hard limit to how much John&amp;#39;s body can turn in each direction is the solution, and not allowing the player to aim further than say, 190 degrees, with perhaps a red indicator where they&amp;#39;re aiming showing the issue. Whether or not to implement this with the non-full body mode is debatable too, and it&amp;#39;d simply need to be tested first hand to see.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;UI&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to do UI in VR games is to be as diegetic as is reasonable. As in, minimise the amount of floating menus. For example, instead of opening an inventory screen, it would be better to instead pull a satchel from your hip, and see your inventory physically in your satchel, similar to Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners. For your map, it should also be a physical object you hold in your hands, and you can simply poke your finger at points on a map to set your waypoint. As for waypoint guidance, a compass should be in order. When on a horse or carriage, it should be attached to the saddle, or be able to be pulled out of John&amp;#39;s breast pocket, and it would follow the pathing toward your waypoint. Perhaps with the pull of a trigger, you can have it switch between different waypoint targets, with a symbol on the compass indicating which one it&amp;#39;s pointing too. Maybe you could have an option to have it permanently attached to your wrist in the options.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ordinarily, you can see how much ammo is in your weapon, though I feel as though this could be optional, being another part of the VR options. After all, if you can&amp;#39;t keep track of six bullets in a revolver, maybe you were never cut out to be an outlaw. Still, it&amp;#39;s important to have the option to turn on or off UI elements.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Controls&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With VR controllers, there are at face value less options than even with a typical modern gamepad, due to the loss of the d-pad, which RDR makes use of. However, with motion controls you can have context-sensitive actions, most commonly being hovering your hand at your hip for a sidearm, and over the shoulder for your primary. This control scheme is commonly used simply because it is natural, and feels right, and can be applied to more than just weapons. Whistling for a horse, for example, wouldn&amp;#39;t be a dedicated button, but instead raising a hand to your mouth and pressing the interact button. Still, radial menus are baked into RDR to begin with, and are a natural fit for VR, so the option to choose between them should be present.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Dead-Eye&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the stand out features of RDR is also one of the features that fits most naturally for VR, and that&amp;#39;s Dead Eye. Slo-mo is welcome in any VR game, due to they more physically demanding nature of VR. As for implementing it, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be too difficult at all, and could even retain the manual\/automatic divide between the two modes. Activating Dead Eye would enable your shooting reticule (which you can turn on or off ordinarily) and, if you have it on automatic, functions just like the base game, marking targets on enemies bodies as the reticule hovers over it. Once you hit trigger, your hand automatically snaps to each target point and blasts it. Manual aiming may well be preferable for VR players, as they&amp;#39;ll use the interact button to mark spots to shoot on an enemy, or can simply fire without marking points to shoot. To minimise the overpowered nature of being able to shoot freely in slow motion, having John&amp;#39;s hand actually have to catch up with the players actual location would be a good way to balance it, otherwise John&amp;#39;s final fight may have gone differently.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Duelling with Dual-ing&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for something trickier, and that&amp;#39;s whether or not dual-wielding revolvers should be present in the game. While you can do so in RDR2, you could not in the original. However. It would feel like a massive missed opportunity to not add this feature, as it is a staple of the genre to have twin six-shooters, and it quite simply feels cool to do, and when a game can make you feel cool, it&amp;#39;s done it&amp;#39;s job. Now, for reloading, most games need you to holster a weapon to reload the other, but After The Fall and Blood &amp;amp; Truth are both VR games that allow you to pick up ammo while you still have a gun in hand, which I believe helps keep up the momentum of combat much more so than having to holster your offhand weapon in the middle of a firefight. As for purchasing this second secondary, perhaps a discount could be added for the second one, a sort of 50% 2-for-1-and-a-half deal exclusive to the VR version. Those wishing to have the vanilla experience of one sidearm at a time can simply choose not to opt for two, so I believe it&amp;#39;s an important feature to add. Speaking of reloading...&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reloading&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There should be 2 options when it comes to reloading - automatic reloading, where John Marston does all the hard work, and manual, where you have to get ready to flick your wrist a lot to open your chamber. The most important change will be having actual weapon animations for reloading, as the original skips over that part for a number of weapons, which I can&amp;#39;t blame them for, considering it&amp;#39;s a third person title, however for VR it&amp;#39;d be an obvious oversight not to overhaul weapon animations.

Arm wrestling is tricky, however, you could theoretically go with button mashing and motion controls, but button mashing a one handed controller while trying precision movements might be a bit much. However, it could be made into a buzz-wire type of game, where you have to make your controller follow a precise path in order to progress. which increased difficulties reducing the size of the path while increasing it&amp;#39;s erratic-ness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the gambling games, keeping them as motion-controlled as possible would be ideal, to retain immersion. For poker, motion controls should work well, such as tapping the table for &amp;quot;call&amp;quot;, or placing your cards face-up for folding. Hell, you could go one step further and have the player physically deal the cards when it&amp;#39;s their turn. Perhaps add in a chastisement from the other players for messing around with the cards, or making a mistake, upon which the cards would reset back to the deck the player is holding. For calling or raising, the player would actually pick up the amount of chips they want to bet, with appropriate HUD indicators for where to put them, or how much is being picked up. Blackjack would use similar motion features, but you could perhaps go one step further by adding voice controls for &amp;quot;hit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;stand&amp;quot;. As for Liars Dice, you would naturally physically shake the cup yourself, but perhaps a new UI element would be needed for calling out how many dice there are, such as a piece of paper where the player touches it to control how many dice they&amp;#39;re calling out, and what their number is. For calling out when someone is a &amp;quot;liar&amp;quot;, perhaps slamming your fist on the table would be appropriate.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Online&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While having the online isn&amp;#39;t entirely necessary, it would be very welcome, and naturally you&amp;#39;d only be playing with other VR players. Dead Eye would be similarly nerfed, as it is in base online, being used entirely for marking and auto-shooting, without slow motion. The game would naturally launch with the Online DLC expansions that released. Heck, if the game is successful enough, perhaps new content could be added, lord knows Take Two will take any opportunity the can get for further monetisation, but if it results in more content then it could well be worth it. Co-op missions especially will be a big draw, especially considering playing for short bursts is well suited to VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Graphics\/Platforms&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With word of a Remaster for RDR floating around, it&amp;#39;s tempting to use the remaster as a basis for a VR port. However there may come a benefit to going with the original - performance. Performance is king in VR, so using the original as a basis instead of the remaster may be preferable, though it will come down to what platforms the port is planning to release on. PC, obviously, and PSVR2 has the power as well, however the Quest 2 doesn&amp;#39;t seem terribly viable, even though RDR is 13 years old at this point, it&amp;#39;s still an open-world game with detailed physics in the form of the Euphoria System. However, the Quest 3 might just be able to handle the base game running in VR, especially if some optimisations are made. Regardless of whether or not the Remaster is used as a base, certain models will have to be upgraded. The player&amp;#39;s weapons are the priority, of course, and should be - as mentioned prior - remade from the ground up, while maintaining the style of the original weapons of course. John Marston&amp;#39;s player model should be upgraded as well, as polygonal, mid-textured hands aren&amp;#39;t a great look in VR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Cutscenes&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the way most in-game cutscenes are handled in games like this, being able to see outside the field of vision you normally can in cutscenes can be quite immersion breaking, as you&amp;#39;ll often see a lack of animations on characters where they didn&amp;#39;t need to be animated, so the best option would be for a 3D theatre-mode cutscene. Heck, you could take the &amp;quot;theatre mode&amp;quot; part literally, and have the player actually sit in a theatre to watch the cutscene. Still, having other options may be possible, depending on how completely the scenes are animated, and players who don&amp;#39;t play with full-body on will still get to see how John looks in his spiffy outfits, so they still have reason to unlock them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;\/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To tl;dr it, with the right amount of elbow grease, RDR has the capacity to be one of the best VR games out there, with excellent depth, immersion, and accessibility that could absolutely be a system seller for whatever platforms it chooses to call home, and I wouldn&amp;#39;t complain if I had to pay a full \u00a360 to play this title.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"b879aeae-1525-11e9-9e0a-0efed9bf948e","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#ff66d1","id":"152f2qu","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"Grakniir","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":7,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/152f2qu\/theoretical_pitch_for_red_dead_redemption_vr_port\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/152f2qu\/theoretical_pitch_for_red_dead_redemption_vr_port\/","subreddit_subscribers":221418,"created_utc":1689630368.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":" \n\nI keep hearing the word ''Demo'' being thrown around whenever someone talks about HELL SWEEPER, like there is a demo out in the wild for everyone to play for free and enjoy the game and find out if it is good or not.\n\nBUT NO CONTEXT.\n\nThis weird thing is even on comments in youtube videos, with people telling others to try HELL SWEEPER demo and find out how good it is.\n\nDid i skip a page ?\n\nAlso if the demo is available on PCVR, shouldn't we PSVR 2 owners get a demo ?\n\nalso....what the heck is wrong with the demo scene on PSVR2 ?

The manual shows the install process quite well but it doesn\u2019t actually show the process for replacing the padding material so it is something you have to figure out but it\u2019s fairly easy to do. The original padding came with a sleeve to wrap around the plastic but the replacement pads use Velcro. \n\nSooo how does the contraption feel?\n\nTLDR - if the stock strap fits you perfectly and doesn\u2019t cause the front to droop, this mod is IMHO unnecessary. \n\nIf you can fashion a Velcro top strap and help balance the headset, this is also unnecessary. \n\nThis mod is really designed for those of us with head shapes that don\u2019t grip the back of stock headstrap well, and the back of the headset has a tendency to slip upwards and the headset droops down and you get a blurry view when your eyes aren\u2019t in the sweet spot. This mod grips the rear of head with a much wider\/larger cup and holds the headset securely preventing the dreaded droop. It also comes with a nice memory foam front pad which does make it more comfortable for long term use. \n\nLonger version. \n\nInstallation\n\nIt\u2019s a bit unnerving prying the stock pads out of the PSVR2 but if you watch Sony\u2019s own tear down video on YouTube, it might give you a bit of confidence. The guide does help - telling you where to start inserting the tool and I didn\u2019t break any plastic tabs in the process. \n\nClipping on the replacement pads is a lot easier and they click back in and fit tightly like the original. It looks like it came out of the factory like this. Much much better than my Frankenstein mod before. \n\nWearing \n\nWearing the unit with the mod keeps me in the sweet spot and the padding gives a tighter fit overall than my Frankenstein mod so I don\u2019t feel a pendulum effect in front when I rotate my head quickly. \n\nThe thicker back padding also has the benefit of placing my Rebuff Reality VR Ears closer to the ideal spot on my ears so the audio improved tremendously for me. I was now able to get deeper punchier bass and the overall volume was louder. The VR Ears are meant to be off ear so if they aren\u2019t pointed directly towards the ear canal, they do lose a lot of bass and volume. I thought I had it pretty much dialed in before this but the new thicker rear padding really brought things up a notch. The angle and length of the VR Ears is adjustable but only within a few preset rotation angles because it can only clip on at certain points of the head strap. Overall quite happy with this change. \n\n\nSweet Spot\nCompared to the stock headstrap, no contest. This is waaay waaaay better for me. Like I said, if you don\u2019t have any issues with the stock strap, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth spending this amount of money. And for some others, a top strap made from Velcro could also help alleviate balance. For me, it\u2019s the difference between not being able to use it at all since the text becomes blurry and everything is off focus off the sweet spot. \n\nNow compared to my Frankenstein mod, I still think my Frankenstein mod is sharper still. \n\nA brief description of the Frankenstein mod\u2026\n\nI use the StudioForm Creative counterweights (160g) on the back and I used Velcro to hold an AMVR back padding for the Quest 2 elastic strap to the back of my PSVR2 headstrap. I can adjust the position of the AMVR back padding so it allows me to pull the back strap all the way down the back of my head and the front strap sits just on my hairline - not touching the forehead. This results in the most razor sharp image sweet spot for me. And it\u2019s something I just barely miss out on with the Globular Cluster kit. The back padding plastic is bulkier and prevents me from pulling it all the way down like on my Franken mod. But the front padding with memory foam does feel more comfortable when I tighten the headset. I can drive for longer with the new set up. \n\nExercise\nI don\u2019t use the PSVR2 for heavy workouts - just for driving in GT7 so I can\u2019t attest to how the material handles sweat. \n\nMore testing ahead\n\nI might try some of the other padding material to see if I can lower the back further and maybe get into my perfect sweet spot a little more. One thing to bear in mind is that my Franken mod is great for my sweet spot but it wasn\u2019t for my friend. This mod should be more universal. \n\nOut of the box, though, it\u2019s already made the PSVR2 go from unusable to almost perfect FOR ME. As I\u2019ve discovered from other VR headsets, fitment can be very subjective. Some people rave about the comfort of a particular headset but you\u2019ll find a percentage who can\u2019t get it work.

The original padding came with a sleeve to wrap around the plastic but the replacement pads use Velcro. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sooo how does the contraption feel?&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR - if the stock strap fits you perfectly and doesn\u2019t cause the front to droop, this mod is IMHO unnecessary. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you can fashion a Velcro top strap and help balance the headset, this is also unnecessary. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mod is really designed for those of us with head shapes that don\u2019t grip the back of stock headstrap well, and the back of the headset has a tendency to slip upwards and the headset droops down and you get a blurry view when your eyes aren\u2019t in the sweet spot. This mod grips the rear of head with a much wider\/larger cup and holds the headset securely preventing the dreaded droop. It also comes with a nice memory foam front pad which does make it more comfortable for long term use. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Longer version. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s a bit unnerving prying the stock pads out of the PSVR2 but if you watch Sony\u2019s own tear down video on YouTube, it might give you a bit of confidence. The guide does help - telling you where to start inserting the tool and I didn\u2019t break any plastic tabs in the process. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clipping on the replacement pads is a lot easier and they click back in and fit tightly like the original. It looks like it came out of the factory like this. Much much better than my Frankenstein mod before. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wearing &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wearing the unit with the mod keeps me in the sweet spot and the padding gives a tighter fit overall than my Frankenstein mod so I don\u2019t feel a pendulum effect in front when I rotate my head quickly. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thicker back padding also has the benefit of placing my Rebuff Reality VR Ears closer to the ideal spot on my ears so the audio improved tremendously for me. I was now able to get deeper punchier bass and the overall volume was louder. The VR Ears are meant to be off ear so if they aren\u2019t pointed directly towards the ear canal, they do lose a lot of bass and volume. I thought I had it pretty much dialed in before this but the new thicker rear padding really brought things up a notch. The angle and length of the VR Ears is adjustable but only within a few preset rotation angles because it can only clip on at certain points of the head strap. Overall quite happy with this change. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sweet Spot\nCompared to the stock headstrap, no contest. This is waaay waaaay better for me. Like I said, if you don\u2019t have any issues with the stock strap, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth spending this amount of money. And for some others, a top strap made from Velcro could also help alleviate balance. For me, it\u2019s the difference between not being able to use it at all since the text becomes blurry and everything is off focus off the sweet spot. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now compared to my Frankenstein mod, I still think my Frankenstein mod is sharper still. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A brief description of the Frankenstein mod\u2026&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use the StudioForm Creative counterweights (160g) on the back and I used Velcro to hold an AMVR back padding for the Quest 2 elastic strap to the back of my PSVR2 headstrap. I can adjust the position of the AMVR back padding so it allows me to pull the back strap all the way down the back of my head and the front strap sits just on my hairline - not touching the forehead. This results in the most razor sharp image sweet spot for me. And it\u2019s something I just barely miss out on with the Globular Cluster kit. The back padding plastic is bulkier and prevents me from pulling it all the way down like on my Franken mod. But the front padding with memory foam does feel more comfortable when I tighten the headset. I can drive for longer with the new set up. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Exercise\nI don\u2019t use the PSVR2 for heavy workouts - just for driving in GT7 so I can\u2019t attest to how the material handles sweat. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More testing ahead&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I might try some of the other padding material to see if I can lower the back further and maybe get into my perfect sweet spot a little more. One thing to bear in mind is that my Franken mod is great for my sweet spot but it wasn\u2019t for my friend. This mod should be more universal. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, though, it\u2019s already made the PSVR2 go from unusable to almost perfect FOR ME. As I\u2019ve discovered from other VR headsets, fitment can be very subjective. Some people rave about the comfort of a particular headset but you\u2019ll find a percentage who can\u2019t get it work. And this kit does work for me.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"url_overridden_by_dest":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/14z2g15","view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"mod_note":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"num_reports":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"14z2g15","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"DoggieHowzer","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":18,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/14z2g15\/globular_cluster_headstrap_mod_kit_and_headphones\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/14z2g15","subreddit_subscribers":221419,"created_utc":1689297695.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"So I'm sure many people have probably discussed this ad nauseum but I'm looking for the most up to date opinions and providing context on why I'm asking this.\n\nI bought a VR1 at the height, move controllers, the works.
