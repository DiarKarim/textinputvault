After 10 hours, I am quite happy with my purchase.  Although a simple game in some respects, the gunplay feels great, the environments are interesting and varied, and the whole game is quite atmospheric.  I've only completed one full run as the starting Rifleman class and there are tons of other classes to experiment with, so as I understand it there could be tens of more hours of enjoyment ahead of me, and my impressions are necessarily limited.\n\n**Graphics:** I believe it runs at 90 Hz without reprojection.  The art direction is superb, and the intense contrasts between bright colors and pitch-black areas make good use of the PSVR2's HDR.  I noticed a little bit of aliasing on occasion, but it seems to be running close to native headset resolution.  Characters have a cartoony look but are nicely detailed, almost like a live-action comic book.\n\n**Gameplay:** The game seems to encourage play as a cover shooter: if you attract enemy fire while exposed, bullets and death will find you quickly. The guns are well-crafted, look and sound great, and feel good to shoot and reload (manually).  You can modify them with several different scopes, magical charms, and other mods to make them more powerful or perform special attacks.  Enemies are mostly humanoid but come in different classes, and there are also some animal enemy types.  The level designs are well done, providing many opportunities for interesting firefights.  Haptics and adaptive triggers are used well.  I play pretty cautiously, so I managed to complete a run on my second try (that first try was quite intense since I hadn't leveled up at all, so my gun was weak and I ran out of ammo a few times!), but that included about 9 hours of gameplay split across the two runs.  On the second run I was more strategic, making good use of sniping points that I hadn't noticed the first time.\n\n**Music:** Wonderfully atmospheric, and always fits the mood.  In friendly encampments there is a string-heavy tune that reminds me a lot of some of Jeremy Soule's work in Skyrim.\n\n**Overall:** Highly recommended, especially if you enjoy shooters with a lot of replayability.

So I tweaked my script a bit so it makes sense without the visuals and copied it below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTowers and Powers is a god like tower defense game and it\u2019s a pretty good one. It retails for $17, its available for PSVR 2, SteamVR, and for Quest you can buy it on Applab.\n\nVR tower defense is hard to get right, as they can feel a little spammy if the player is very hands on in the defense, or boring if you just sit back and watch events unfold.  I\u2019ve also seen other TD games that try to include motion controls, but they end up as frustrating gimmicks.   But Towers and Powers incorporates VR pretty well and it keeps you engaged. You're always busy managing something.  You\u2019re deploying barricades, moving tower pieces around or even plucking explosive elements out of the air, and bombing the monsters below.  \n\nThe core of Towers and Powers revolves around mixing and matching the 6 different unit types to build towers.  The units can stand and defend in person, but you\u2019ll want to keep them in a tower most of the time.  To build a tower, simply hire or grab a unit and drop them on one of the designated spots.  Each tower maxes out at 3 levels.   The unit on the top level of the tower dictates the type of attack the tower puts out.  However, the other units in the tower provide thematic upgrades.  Some upgrades are passive, like increasing damage or fire rate, but others cause secondary attacks that chain to other monsters.  The game encourages you to mix and match units to make the best possible tower.\n\nBut let's look at a few examples, Imagine a tower topped with a mage shooting out ice blasts that slow monsters. Below that is an engineer who adds chain lighting to the attacks every few seconds, and I wanted it to attack faster, so I tossed in a peasant on the bottom floor.  The order of the first and second floors don\u2019t matter, the benefits are just based on the unit type.  So a peasant not on the top floor will always provide the same attack speed bonus and so on.  But stacking multiple units of the same type in a tower upgrades their bonus effect.   Further up the lane, I had a Monk tower, whose AOE attack weakens monsters, The monk was paired with a Viking who every few seconds chucks an axe spiking a weakened enemy.  Now that's religious cooperation!  Or maybe you want to combine magic and science! Two frost mages could supercharge an Engineer\u2019s fiery explosions adding in a bunch of extra damage to the AOE.\n\nAnd the best part is that experimentation is encouraged because at any time you can pluck a unit out of a tower and put them atop a different one.  Or just build a new one entirely, if you have the units for it.  In fact, this is a skill you will need to master in the later stages of the game, as you need to shift around your defenses to different lanes, oftentimes during the assault.  \n\nHowever your units can do more than just construct towers, the arcane ones can occupy alters giving you stuff like throwable magic powers.  Your other units?  Have them labor away in the workshops building things like barricades, mines or spike traps depending on which unit you assign to the shop.  And then there is the upgrader, if you man it with viking,  they will upgrade that barricade so that it now reflects damage, but toss a monk in the upgrader, and suddenly attackers who dare touch it find themselves weakened! And to be successful in this game, I think you really need a balanced approach.  \n\nI often found myself thinking about this game and all the different ways to assign a unit when i wasn't even playing it.  Overall the unit system here works extremely well. On the surface, it seems like you have just 6 different types of towers, but then the uses for those units quickly multiply once you\u2019re introduced to all of this stuff.  It's intuitive, easy to grasp, and has a surprising amount of depth.  Managing the units, grabbing barricades, upgrading them and so on, keeps you busy and engaged but you don\u2019t feel overloaded or stressed out.  And every unit you hire is useful, even the cheap peasants.  Sometimes you just want it for its attack speed bonus in another tower, or maybe you find it's best to have them clog up the lanes with barricades.\n\nYou\u2019re also always listening and on the lookout for golden snitch-like flying orbs that you can Harry Potter out of mid-air. Some are just powerups, but others can be thrown for dramatic effect.   The orbs are nothing revolutionary, but they are fun, and it's an effective way to incorporate motion controls and it keeps you further engaged. In fact, one of the early levels had you catching cannon balls fired from an enemy Viking longboat and redirecting them towards the monsters.  But sadly this was a bit of an anomaly.  No other levels do this or anything like it, it feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  It would have been fun to have stuff like a volcano bursting out molten rocks or even something like a rock slide or a tsunami that would force you to redirect its path.  I mean you are a deity after all.  \n\nBut when shit really starts to get intense, channel your inner child and draw some shapes in the sky to activate one of your godlike powers to reign down death from above!  But they do take a long time to recharge, so pick the perfect moment.  And I never once miss cast a god power, I mean most of them are the easy shapes your kindergarten teacher had you drawing, but why overcomplicate something with intricate runes or extremely specific gestures that require a lot of practice to only frustrate more than help?  The god powers aren't wildly creative, I bet you can guess what most of them are, but it's certainly satisfying to watch a load of fireballs save your ass.\n\nAnd that's pretty much the core of Towers and Powers.  There are 15 stages in total and each one will take you somewhere between 20-30 minutes to complete.  For me, it took around 5 hours to get to the final stage.  So you\u2019re looking at anywhere from 4-7 hours of content for under 20 bucks.  And I think thats a fair price.  But right now I can\u2019t beat the last level, its kicking my ass.  I\u2019m not going to show it on screen here, but It might be a tad too punishing.   And its unfortunately that this game stumbled right at the finish line.  I even turned the difficulty down to easy, and I still got completely destroyed.   I cruised through the first 10 stages with moderate challenge  Stages 11-15 are when it starts to really get Olympic and demand that you multitask and shift units around on the fly. But the last stage is just an unfortunate outlier.   \n\nAnd it did reveal what I think is a flaw in managing your units.  You can only put a unit on top of a tower.  If you are quickly shifting stuff around, it can get a little messy.  As your towers can get scrambled. I wish there was a way you could grab a unit and insert them into the middle of a tower.  Most of the time I just want to upgrade what the unit on top is doing.  But to do that you have to remove the top layer, add the new unit, and then put the top layer back on. You can\u2019t even hold two units at once, despite having two hands.   It would also be nice if I could somehow pick up an entire tower and just relocate it without having to deconstruct it first.\n\nI also think the game could use a codex.  There are probably 5 or 6 different ways to use each unit, and it's just hard to remember all the different things they can do.  I also think there needs to be a codex page reminding you of all the gesture abilities.  I\u2019ve forgotten a few, and tend to just rely on my kindergarten shapes.  The only way to see the gestures again is to go back and play the levels where they were first introduced, and that doesn't help me in the heat of battle on wave 4 of 8.\n\nSo do I recommend the game?  If you\u2019re in the market for a tower defense game or you're looking for a good seated game yes I do recommend it.   I have enjoyed my time with it, its smooth, pretty well balanced, and Towers and Powers has a fair amount of depth.  Now I don\u2019t think too many people will really be spending hundreds of hours playing this game, but for $17 I think its worth a purchase, and definitely if you can catch it on a sale.   I always like having good seated games to change up the pace. And who knows maybe with more feedback the developers will tweak that final stage.","author_fullname":"t2_a7mpw","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Towers and Powers Review","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18sung6","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1703772267.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello All!&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM\"&gt;https:\/\/youtu.be\/doQ94TrHAcM&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate it if you would give my video a watch, I give some pretty good examples in it to help give you an idea of what this game is like.

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord on the PSVR2, but you should keep reading to decide for yourself.\n\nIt is a game designed with co-op for up to 4P set in a faithful recreation of the Ghostbusters universe, but the option to play co-op (including cross-play) doesn't open up until you complete the intro and one mandatory Infestation Mission ([18:05](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1085s)). Once you are past those, you can visit the main-menu ([24:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1440s)) and choose to host or join another player. The game supports standard Invite \/ Join system for your friends on the same VR platform and provides a lengthy 8-digit room code for friends on other VR platforms like Meta Quest ([24:58](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1498s)). The game also supports quick match to join you to those players that are playing as host and open to public.\n\nThe game is set in San Francisco and setup with a simple story setup that you will go through during the intro which also serves as your tutorial introducing you to familiar elements from Ghostbusters franchise such as PKE Meter, Ghost Trap, and Neutrono Wand (your proton stream weapon). Beyond the intro, where you are guided by female voice named Gabriela, she will continue to be your guide providing instructions and story context as you join the Ghostbusters. The central hub also has TV broadcast providing additional story context as the game continues.\n\nThe central hub is a Fire Station with stations for training ([24:14](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1454s)), upgrading equipment ([28:02](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1682s)), selecting player avatar and selecting missions. If playing co-op, especially once a cross-player is added (not sure why, but it seems to boost mic volumes), you will probably have to use settings to tweak audio so that VOIP is audible without being too loud ([29:10](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1750s)).  Once the game has given you ability to play co-op, you can continue solo or co-op by choosing from a number of different mission types across different locations, each time earning you currency you can use in the player hub area (fire station) to upgrade either your PKE Meter, Ghost Trap or Neutrono Wand.\n\nThe game original launched with 4 mission types, but 2 more were added post-launch:\n\n* Infestation ([30:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=1800s)) allows you to go through a location with some small ghost encounters, ending with a ghost boss encounter.\n* Exorcism involves closing a portal, but to do this you have to use your PKE Meter to find 3 particular items, attach them to generators and unleash Ghost Boss encounter.\n* On The Clock is a mode where you fight against waves of enemies to ensure you can clear area in time permitted.\n* Giga Trap Retrieval involves finding correct location of trap and carefully extracting it which can have variety of effects that made it exciting.\n* Harvester involves repairing a machine and capturing ghosts.\n* Heist &amp; Seek ([43:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4LI-nyNyREI&amp;t=2580s)) is a competitive mode where players go through multiple ghost encounters to catch golden ghosts while competing for who got the most gold.\n\nYou are expected to play these mission types repeatedly in the variety of locations for as long as you like. To complete the game, there are also story related missions involving additional characters and battle(s?) with Ghost Lord. We haven't played those yet. While playing co-op if any player is downed, they must high-five one of the remaining players to get revived. They are free to move around in their downed state.\n\nWhile playing you can encounter marshmallow packs which will attach a bunch of annoying mini-pufts to your body and Neutrono Wand. They have to be smacked (either by you or your allies) to resume ability for your weapon to work. At least one time in what we played (not covered in gameplay shared) my weapon wouldn't resume working even though we had gotten rid of all the mini-pufts. The game also hard crashed the time we tried playing Exorcism mid-mission so expect the possibility of some frustrating bugs that aren't patched way yet.\n\nIt looks like a simpler game than it is because there is skill involved in how you beam on to the tougher enemies where you first have have to take down their shield and then lasso-pull them to drain their health. While you are doing that, there is audio and even a visual temperature meter that displays on the ghost you are lasso-pulling and have to press X to give them a big hit or risk overheating your proton weapon. Then you have to place a trap and capture them before they recover. All while avoiding any area effect or projectile attacks that the ghosts are doing.\n\nWorth mentioning that the game defaults to smooth locomotion, but does offer option to change to teleport. It also offers blinders which are off by default. It defaults to a quick-turn option which is a happy medium between snap turn and smooth turn (both offered).\n\nI think it is much harder to play with teleport because you can't strafe out of the way of projectiles while maintaining fire, so if you would play with teleport (for VR comfort reasons), you should plan to be playing co-op rather than solo. Speaking of which, I actually wouldn't recommend this game for solo even if you can play with default of smooth locomotion because I think it is more fun co-op and also feels balanced for more players. I had to play on my wife's game just to help her get past the tutorial fights required solo so she could play co-op with us, and it wasn't as fun and I had to change to smooth locomotion to be able to complete it easier, then back to teleport for her VR comfort.\n\nThe game is using resistive triggers and haptic feedback in the controllers. I haven't felt any in haptics in the headset.

Movement is not entirely automatic because you have to slice \/ shoot enemies or destroy targets in the environment to make your hero proceed further. Other times Your off-hand is used to grapple you through the environments.\n\nThe enemies can be ranged or melee and display numbers to indicate how many hits they will take to dispatch and introduces new enemy types as you advance. The katana can also be used to deflect melee attacks or incoming bullets. Your off-hand grapple move can pull shields towards your off-hand. The shields you pick up also have a number displayed and can last until the number is depleted. You can try shooting at melee enemies but they are excellent at using their katanas to deflect all your bullets, so you have to close in and use your sword for those. For ranged enemies, you have to use combination of physical dodging and katana deflection whenever incoming bullets are highlighted red and otherwise focus on shooting them with your handgun. Boss enemies are bullet sponges where you have to learn right tactics for their fight to make it through.\n\nYou start with 10 health and once that is depleted you lose and respawn to recent checkpoint and get to try the section again. The game requires skill improvement to advance, but respawning from checkpoint restores your health so you have best chance of advancing to next checkpoint. Because of this, pretty much everyone playing the game should be able to make it through full campaign since it is designed to be fun, not frustrating. You will see many claims of how short the game is because of this.\n\nBeyond completing the 10 or so levels to get to ending, the game challenges players to complete each level within a time challenge, while finding and shooting 5 medals, and completing without dying for 3-star completions. This is where it will provide the best fun and replay value because the gameplay systems are very fluid and engaging. Trophy wise, the game also has challenges related to completing boss fights without taking damage or completing levels without using shield and other such challenges. A platinum trophy awaits anyone that can complete all the challenges and find \/ shoot all the collectible secrets. Although it features time trials, it doesn't seem to feature leaderboards for friends or otherwise which would have been nice to have.\n\nThe game is using haptic feedback and resistive triggers on the controllers. It is also using headset haptics when you get shot. The game uses snap-turns without any option to change to smooth turning but it is generally not needed (you can turn in real life for all your needs). The game looks better in headset as most VR games do, but the video capture I have provided is pretty representative of the colors, brightness and contrast within headset. The game is using a k-pop soundtrack that is very fitting for its style and progression through stages. The soundtrack seems to react to how you are doing in-game like mellowing out when you are low on health and pumping up otherwise. All sound effects are also fitting, and also get muffled when your health is low. There are settings related to adjusting audio volume more to your liking.\n\nThe story really isn't the draw, but is themed around Korean neo-noir action cinema tropes and has something to do with rescuing a tiger cub from rival gangs. There are minimal cutscenes like I remember from games like Streets of Rage.\n\nFor myself, I expect this will be a good VR party game like Zombieland: Headshot Fever because it is very intuitive to pick up and start having fun with short action filled levels.

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my time with it, I do recommend playing ForeVR Bowl on PSVR2, but you should probably read more below or check some or all of the linked video above before deciding for yourself.\n\nIt is an arcade bowling game with single player and multiplayer for up to 4 players. It can feel very unauthentic to bowling if you are expecting it to control something like Wii Sports Bowling, because how the ball goes down the aisle is based more on the properties of the ball which include Weight, Speed, Spin and Profile. The last one named Profile is sort of like a trait or special function like No Spin or Avoid Gutter.\n\nThe game has 150+ distinct balls with their own properties to set them apart. They can also have different visual effects and sounds as you bowl them down the aisle. The way you unlock balls is tied to your Player Level or finding hidden balls in each of the areas to unlock your ability to buy the ball by placing it into your selection of 5 active balls and paying the required coins. There seem to be 1-2 hidden balls in each area (most having 2). You can earn the coins by playing or using the spin wheel.  \n\nThe game offers three different throw styles that can be changed in options:\n\n* Optimized Throw (default): Recommended. Optimized for most throw types.\n* Default Throw (not the default): Core physics with release optimization.\n* Classic Throw: No added physics or optimizations.\n\nThe Dark Mage ball which costs 0 coins and is available to buy from the start is the easy-win ball, at least while your throwing style is set to Optimized or Default Throw. They might be even easier balls or just more fun balls as we progress further, but this one seems most capable from ball we tried of bowling closer to a perfect 300 game as expected by the game's trophy list (which does include Platinum).\n\nThere are a number of halls to select which are visually distinct from one another with new hidden balls to find. They also might have distinct oil patterns unique to them. When selecting a match, you have to select the hall and oil pattern. We tried some different combinations, and we can tell changing the oil pattern effects the gameplay, but don't have a good idea yet of how exactly. At least one hall include bumpers that can't be removed while most don't. There is an option to add bumpers for certain game modes (Free Play or Private Rooms) but we didn't try using it. Regardless, in what we played, the Dark Mage ball remained easiest way to get Strikes, Spares and Splits.\n\nWhile playing I observed following defects:\n\n* I spun the wheel in hub area to win 200 coins but didn't have 200 coins available when I went to the Pro Shop to buy a ball.\n* It can display a higher number of coins available before you try buying a ball then it shows when you are trying to buy ball.\n* The player avatar selection function isn't working reliably. You have to click on the left-right arrows using X button since grip buttons don't work reliably.\n* The Camera doesn't show what picture it took in-game (like ForeVR Pool), but it does save to your PS5 Media storage (unlike ForeVR Pool).\n* The Camera selfie option doesn't include your player avatar in the selfie picture that it saves to your PS5 Media storage.\n* The trophy rack doesn't update to include your unlocked trophies like ForeVR Pool.\n* During one match, we were both in party chat, but game said we have lost connection to something. Go to Lobby, try again.\n* During one match, the player turn wouldn't transition after strike. Reset Frame gave warning about stats won't be counted but didn't help us get past issue. Go to Lobby, try again.\n* At one-point, other player reported not seeing my ball, just the result, but this fixed itself within a couple of throws during that match. \n\nSome of the options are unclear about what they do. For instance, I tried disabling Show Throw Line hoping the graphic overlay that shows up with each throw to the right of the aisle and blocks view of the ball thrown for observing player but I think it just disables the line that shows up on the aisle. Didn't find a way to disable the graphic overlay that shows up.\n\nThe game is using haptic feedback. The graphics look much better within headset (vibrant) while the video capture looks washed out (bright &amp; faded). I think games that are using HDR to look vibrant in headset tend to have poorer video capture using native PS5 video capture options. The sound effects and background sound are fitting for any of the halls, but the hub area has the annoying Christmas Tree thing advertising other ForeVR games making too much noise like in ForeVR Pool. It is less loud and abrasive in ForeVR Bowl.\n\nThe movement controls are limited to teleports with snap turns, or move around in roomscale. I don't mind the teleport for this, but I would have liked smooth turn over snap turns it has. It does allow you to tweak how much each snap should turn you. I'm finding for any game that uses teleports &amp; snap-turns, I lose spacial awareness of where I am in real-world much easier. This makes it much easier to get closer to furniture that might be within your boundary or too close to your boundary. This is the first game where I have managed to hit something (other than two controller together or headset) while playing. I adapted after that to be more careful and didn't have further incident, but something worth mentioning.\n\nBasically, this game is less polished than ForeVR Pool (see defects observed above in just 1 hour of play) but is more intuitive to start and play effectively. Bowling is also more fun than Pool for us, but both are games we will be playing more of. It was initially disappointing that Bowling isn't as authentic as Pool and is more of an arcade game than a bowling simulation like Wii Sports Bowling, but we like the idea of trying lots of different balls that will be playing differently and maybe self-imposing on us to not use the Dark Mage ball, and maybe trying the game set to Classic Throw for less arcade experience. It also supports up to 4P online (ForeVR Pool is just 2P for now) and once we know it supports cross-play with Meta Quest, we expect to be playing up to 4P like we enjoy Walkabout Mini Golf together.

You can earn the coins by playing or using the spin wheel.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game offers three different throw styles that can be changed in options:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimized Throw (default): Recommended. Optimized for most throw types.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Default Throw (not the default): Core physics with release optimization.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Classic Throw: No added physics or optimizations.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dark Mage ball which costs 0 coins and is available to buy from the start is the easy-win ball, at least while your throwing style is set to Optimized or Default Throw. They might be even easier balls or just more fun balls as we progress further, but this one seems most capable from ball we tried of bowling closer to a perfect 300 game as expected by the game&amp;#39;s trophy list (which does include Platinum).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of halls to select which are visually distinct from one another with new hidden balls to find. They also might have distinct oil patterns unique to them. When selecting a match, you have to select the hall and oil pattern. We tried some different combinations, and we can tell changing the oil pattern effects the gameplay, but don&amp;#39;t have a good idea yet of how exactly. At least one hall include bumpers that can&amp;#39;t be removed while most don&amp;#39;t. There is an option to add bumpers for certain game modes (Free Play or Private Rooms) but we didn&amp;#39;t try using it. Regardless, in what we played, the Dark Mage ball remained easiest way to get Strikes, Spares and Splits.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While playing I observed following defects:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I spun the wheel in hub area to win 200 coins but didn&amp;#39;t have 200 coins available when I went to the Pro Shop to buy a ball.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It can display a higher number of coins available before you try buying a ball then it shows when you are trying to buy ball.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The player avatar selection function isn&amp;#39;t working reliably. You have to click on the left-right arrows using X button since grip buttons don&amp;#39;t work reliably.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Camera doesn&amp;#39;t show what picture it took in-game (like ForeVR Pool), but it does save to your PS5 Media storage (unlike ForeVR Pool).&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Camera selfie option doesn&amp;#39;t include your player avatar in the selfie picture that it saves to your PS5 Media storage.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The trophy rack doesn&amp;#39;t update to include your unlocked trophies like ForeVR Pool.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During one match, we were both in party chat, but game said we have lost connection to something. Go to Lobby, try again.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;During one match, the player turn wouldn&amp;#39;t transition after strike. Reset Frame gave warning about stats won&amp;#39;t be counted but didn&amp;#39;t help us get past issue. Go to Lobby, try again.&lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At one-point, other player reported not seeing my ball, just the result, but this fixed itself within a couple of throws during that match. &lt;\/li&gt;\n&lt;\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the options are unclear about what they do. For instance, I tried disabling Show Throw Line hoping the graphic overlay that shows up with each throw to the right of the aisle and blocks view of the ball thrown for observing player but I think it just disables the line that shows up on the aisle. Didn&amp;#39;t find a way to disable the graphic overlay that shows up.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game is using haptic feedback. The graphics look much better within headset (vibrant) while the video capture looks washed out (bright &amp;amp; faded). I think games that are using HDR to look vibrant in headset tend to have poorer video capture using native PS5 video capture options. The sound effects and background sound are fitting for any of the halls, but the hub area has the annoying Christmas Tree thing advertising other ForeVR games making too much noise like in ForeVR Pool. It is less loud and abrasive in ForeVR Bowl.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The movement controls are limited to teleports with snap turns, or move around in roomscale. I don&amp;#39;t mind the teleport for this, but I would have liked smooth turn over snap turns it has. It does allow you to tweak how much each snap should turn you. I&amp;#39;m finding for any game that uses teleports &amp;amp; snap-turns, I lose spacial awareness of where I am in real-world much easier. This makes it much easier to get closer to furniture that might be within your boundary or too close to your boundary. This is the first game where I have managed to hit something (other than two controller together or headset) while playing. I adapted after that to be more careful and didn&amp;#39;t have further incident, but something worth mentioning.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, this game is less polished than ForeVR Pool (see defects observed above in just 1 hour of play) but is more intuitive to start and play effectively. Bowling is also more fun than Pool for us, but both are games we will be playing more of. It was initially disappointing that Bowling isn&amp;#39;t as authentic as Pool and is more of an arcade game than a bowling simulation like Wii Sports Bowling, but we like the idea of trying lots of different balls that will be playing differently and maybe self-imposing on us to not use the Dark Mage ball, and maybe trying the game set to Classic Throw for less arcade experience. It also supports up to 4P online (ForeVR Pool is just 2P for now) and once we know it supports cross-play with Meta Quest, we expect to be playing up to 4P like we enjoy Walkabout Mini Golf together. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DpmCxXk-tRBaSvm7jRUuKx9BD9MytY3wYrr_jdHnbuc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=b5373f78f22011227c7278036e7629486f047ac0","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DpmCxXk-tRBaSvm7jRUuKx9BD9MytY3wYrr_jdHnbuc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c359b139a8417f21f396bb97703fe2c6f82947d0","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DpmCxXk-tRBaSvm7jRUuKx9BD9MytY3wYrr_jdHnbuc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f949811ae2ef59ab9bc83b5c64604743b095b026","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/DpmCxXk-tRBaSvm7jRUuKx9BD9MytY3wYrr_jdHnbuc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26e177c2880427d6db7a0df4205f06a79337481d","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"mNzVzjjppvvXfO-ApMAkH6WiCX5kGoyotvjgxATo8Co"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"18mxw9x","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18mxw9x\/forevr_bowl_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18mxw9x\/forevr_bowl_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":227867,"created_utc":1703087876.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"\u2026and now it\u2019s my favourite game of all time I think.

I think being in VR helps this type of gameplay feel fresh and more enjoyable. It is the depth perception that VR provides that make some simple tasks like dropping down or jumping up more thrilling. There are 3 types of collectibles in each level and I think saving all the Vex like smaller-character (10 in each level) grants you a collectible for the shelf on your ship that takes you between levels.

I tried both, and I think Fixed Camera suits the game better for its platforming and combat challenges, while Free Camera is good if you are trying to find collectibles in any area after clearing out the enemies. There isn't a way to quickly switch between Free and Fixed camera which would be a welcome use of one of the unused buttons.\n\nAs is normal for most PSVR2 games, it looks better in the headset than the video capture.

It feels like a Quest port much more than other Quest ports to PSVR2 I can think of. The soundtrack, sound effects and voice call outs are fitting.

So, let me quickly clarify a few things before I get into the meat and potatoes of this post. First off, I will be completely honest in saying that this review will be from a fairly biased perspective, as I am a big fan of this series, so that definitely factored into my opinion of the game. Secondly, I justify this as a full review, as I have completed all the levels in the game, and have unlocked both endings. Besides a few trophies left to get, I have seen practically everything in my time with the game. To be precise, I have spent about 10-12 hours with the game the past few days. Okay, now that that's clarified, let's move on with the review!\n\nOkay, so I'm going to do this in chunks:\n\nGraphics: So, I've heard different things from different people, as some really like the graphics, and others not as much. In my time with the game, I feel that the game looks spectacular, as the lighting looks great, and the game pops with color in many areas. There is some occasional shimmering on small objects, but for the most part, everything looks great in my opinion! The environments looks incredibly detailed and well-decorated. (As they should, FNAF is a very stylized franchise.) Black levels are spectacular as well, as I've had plenty of moments where dread and tension rise due to areas being dark. Overall, I think that the graphics look great! They're maybe not quite as high as games like horizon, but it makes sense as this game wasn't built exclusively for PSVR2, as it's on PC, and it's coming to quest in the spring.\n\nPerformance: I'm not great at determining what fps I'm playing at, but in my experience, the game has consistently and constantly run smoothly, with no frame drops. I haven't experienced any performance issues, so that's a bonus! Now, I don't think the game's fps quite matches that of the first Help Wanted on PSVR2, as that game was brought up to 120 fps, if I remember correctly. All I know is that for this game, performance has been superb on my end, and I haven't experienced any frame drops whatsoever.\n\nHeadset Features: This game utilizes the PSVR2 headset and sense controller features fairly well! Haptic feedback is utilized quite frequently in the sense controllers, and I feel that it's used well! For example, there's a whack-a-mole type minigame in which you whack little bots with mallets, and you can feel that sensation of that in the controllers. While headset rumble is utilized, it's definitely not used quite as much. I actually think that the first Help Wanted utilized headset rumble more, and somewhat more effectively. This doesn't really bother me though, as I've been having a lot of fun with the game.\n\nScare Factor: So, the way this game does scares is fairly similar to other fnaf games. It's not your typical blood-and-guts, heads-rolling type of horror. It's more about spooky background noises being sounded out your environment. Don't get me wrong though, there are plenty of moments in which characters will get up in your face and give you a good scare! And obviously, there are plenty of jumpscares. I know this style of horror isn't for everyone, but I myself can think of multiple moments in which I was pretty spooked! Also, this game is great at building tension and pressure! Many of the levels involve you completing tasks while under a time limit, which effectively build up pressure and tension! Personally, I love this feeling, as I get a thrill out of working on a time limit knowing that if I screw up, the closest-by animatronic is coming for me!\n\nGameplay: So, this is what I've been really excited to talk about!!! This game has so much variety, I am just completely blown away! While I love the first Help Wanted, half of that game was just levels from the old games converted into vr. While that stuff is still fun, it's obviously not original. This time around though, I would say that 80-90% of the game is original, made-for-vr levels! The variety this time around is nuts, and I couldn't be happier with it! Just to name a few different levels, you'll be mixing music beats with a giant DJ animatronic, you'll be giving makeovers, you'll be cooking food orders, you'll be fixing broken-down rides, making arts-and-crafts, and performing surgery! And in each of these levels, there's at least one animatronic, if not more, who'd like to have a word with you by jumpscaring the daylights out of you! I am blown away by the creativity and variety of this game, and I plan on wiping my save clean and doing another playthrough because I like the game so darn much!\n\nStory: So, for those of you who don't follow the story, you probably won't understand the endings very much. Don't let that deter you though, as this game isn't very story-oriented. You can just play the levels and enjoy them for what they are, as you don't need to have background knowledge to play any of the levels. Each level comes with a basic tutorial on the ins-and-outs of that particular level, so you'll be well-equipped on how to play! For those of you who follow fnaf like I do, there's plenty of references and easter eggs to find!\n\nWell, that about covers my thoughts on the game! I would give it a 9\/10, as I overall freakin' loved it! Feel free to ask me questions if you're on the fence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","author_fullname":"t2_348ecyr1","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 Full Review","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18kkci9","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1702828755.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 on the PSVR2, especially if you are into mini-game compilations or VR experience games. So far, I like it much better than first Help Wanted game and I don't think there is any need to play them in order.\n\nIt is considered a horror game because of its use of jump scares and its infamous cast of homicidal animatronics that are a mainstay in all FNaF games. In this one, you are a new employee of Fazbear Entertainment and your job is to maintain the pizzeria and interact with the animatronics through over 40 mini-game levels across a variety of locations and activities that you select using computer screen in the hub area.\n\n* Food Prep: 3 mini-games starting with El Chip's.

[21:38](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6yVNVAXOyss&amp;t=1298s)\n\nAs you complete mini-games successfully, you unlock additional mini-games and introduce changes to your hub area as well.\n\nThe graphics and sound are excellent, and the game is using controller haptics, but I haven't felt any headset haptics. I think most of the game can be played without needing to use thumbsticks to turn, but it does offer option to change from default of snap turns to smooth turning including settings for speed of turning. You don't really need to because the game teleports you to different mini-games and they are all played from stationary location and the best turning \/ movement is to use real-world movement within those stationary locations.\n\nThe best observation I have about the game is how polished all the VR grab\/interact controls are through all the mini-games. Some of the mini-games like El Chip's in Food Prep could be their own stand-alone game. If you like games like Vacation Simulator or Startenders or Prison Boss, then this is a more polished game for the type of VR interactive gameplay I have found enjoyable in those games.\n\nA neutral observation I have about the game is how ambiguous some of the mini-game expectations can be, so it can take some trial and error and figuring things out for yourself. I think it is an intentional design choice to give the game its horror vibe by keeping the player uncertain and unsettled in order to keep the tension on otherwise simple VR experience type gameplay.\n\nThe worst observation I have about the game was in Fazcade shooting mini-game Fazerblast where it requires holding of the grip trigger button to keep hold of the weapon. It would be better if it detected capacitative touch to keep hold of the weapon even if the grip button has to be pressed to grab it. I also want the ghost hand to wrap around the gun better when I use two hand to hold such a weapon. So very minor QOL complaints in just one part of the overall game.\n\nFor people concerned about horror of the game being too much, I think the Sister Location mini-game(s) may be most obscure and unnerving \/ frustrating because, judging from its first game (Ballora Gallery), it will certainly take trial and error like original FNaF games in Help Wanted to figure it out and get through. This means crawling around in the dark, listening for audio cues and repeating if you get jump scared until you make it through.\n\nI think FNaF fans will be happy with the quality and quantity of gameplay experiences and creepy animatronics that provide tension and punish the player with a jump scare whenever player fails which is a signature trope of the FNaF franchise.

If you like games like Vacation Simulator or Startenders or Prison Boss, then this is a more polished game for the type of VR interactive gameplay I have found enjoyable in those games.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A neutral observation I have about the game is how ambiguous some of the mini-game expectations can be, so it can take some trial and error and figuring things out for yourself. I think it is an intentional design choice to give the game its horror vibe by keeping the player uncertain and unsettled in order to keep the tension on otherwise simple VR experience type gameplay.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The worst observation I have about the game was in Fazcade shooting mini-game Fazerblast where it requires holding of the grip trigger button to keep hold of the weapon. It would be better if it detected capacitative touch to keep hold of the weapon even if the grip button has to be pressed to grab it. I also want the ghost hand to wrap around the gun better when I use two hand to hold such a weapon. So very minor QOL complaints in just one part of the overall game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For people concerned about horror of the game being too much, I think the Sister Location mini-game(s) may be most obscure and unnerving \/ frustrating because, judging from its first game (Ballora Gallery), it will certainly take trial and error like original FNaF games in Help Wanted to figure it out and get through. This means crawling around in the dark, listening for audio cues and repeating if you get jump scared until you make it through.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think FNaF fans will be happy with the quality and quantity of gameplay experiences and creepy animatronics that provide tension and punish the player with a jump scare whenever player fails which is a signature trope of the FNaF franchise. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/kdB7j52Ors5_MR8WmK7zgPYTR_pEAeoXAVY1yW7r154.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=45e4090b7a352fc177866df6c859c90553493476","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/kdB7j52Ors5_MR8WmK7zgPYTR_pEAeoXAVY1yW7r154.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2d003922966db1e683be4068df2ccd87338820","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/kdB7j52Ors5_MR8WmK7zgPYTR_pEAeoXAVY1yW7r154.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f80ac88210b766a1ac4335524520a21452ef398c","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/kdB7j52Ors5_MR8WmK7zgPYTR_pEAeoXAVY1yW7r154.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=92600987b363bb9a1398114a71b3a1d748610307","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"XL9heR6QnL9MGH-M_VmGNUQ-5OcJQczz81vYOI13bWw"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"18j07h8","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18j07h8\/five_nights_at_freddys_help_wanted_2_on_psvr2\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/18j07h8\/five_nights_at_freddys_help_wanted_2_on_psvr2\/","subreddit_subscribers":227466,"created_utc":1702647243.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"I played T&amp;P when it dropped and it's super short(15 levels).

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do not recommend playing Prison Boss VR on the PSVR2, unless you are specifically into VR Experience games like Job Simulator and starved for more.\n\nIt is a VR Experience game that lets you experience the life of a prisoner who crafts and sells items to earn money and reputation. You can only craft at night, but have to be mindful of the guard patrols or have all your resources that are not hidden be confiscated. You can use your earnings to buy new furniture, customize your cell, or buy resources to make all the items needed to complete jobs which are the primary way to advance progression in the game in a less repetitive way. As you complete jobs to increase your reputation, you receive reward boxes which can be opened to unlock new furniture or resource options as well as camera reels that will teach you new crafting items.\n\nThe game does not use thumbsticks for moving or turning, so all movement has to be done in real-life which makes this a very comfortable game for VR, but also requires more awareness and management of the PSVR2 headset wire. The game has very limited settings allowing you to choose between roomscale, standing and sitting. I played standing on the roomscale setting, but I think standing option would play the same except just has everything closer together. I assume sitting option would also work the same, so if planning to play sitting, you may need a swivel chair and you will also have to be mindful of how many circles you do while playing on a wired headset.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic is using your chunky three finger hands to grab and interact with crafting materials to create items or furniture to store and retrieve items. My greatest issue in the game was not having any precision of control on what you are trying to grab out of drawers because game has hard time figuring out if you are trying to grab the drawer or an item from within the drawer. It is much easier to work with items on top of desks or within safe. The game is using haptic feedback for any of the interactions where you have to hold either Circle \/ R3 while holding with right hand or Triangle \/ L3 while holding with left hand. Also, when you have to move the thumbstick in circular motion with offhand while holding item with primary hand (ex: to roll cigarette).\n\nThe graphics and art style are simple, and the game is focusing on humor, not immersion. The soundtrack is fitting, and sound effects serviceable.\n\nThe game has a Platinum trophy and reviewing the trophy list, I can see that there will be 4 different prisons and there are binary choices of how you will advance between prisons, so the game expects minimally two play-through for completionists. I can also see that each prison will have focus on different types of recipes and maybe even an overall simple story arc by end of fourth prison. The game will also award you Gold Medal or not on your performance of how you complete each of the four prisons in Story Mode, which means the game wants you to be more efficient with your days and not take it too slowly as you advance the calendar of your time in prison.\n\nAs you try to maximize your time each night, you end up having more than one prison guard, so managing getting things done while not getting caught is the most thrilling aspect of the game. I also noted that certain prison guards move faster than others, so you have to learn to recognize them and work accordingly.\n\nThere are also additional game modes such as Arcade and Boss Mode. It isn't covered in this gameplay video uploaded, but I did try Arcade Mode and I think it would be a real challenge to get the scores expected for the Arcade Mode trophies, at least with the recipes currently available for the points they earn so it may be best to wait until after Story Mode is completed and all crafting recipes are available. I presume Boss Mode would also unlock after completing the Story Mode at least once.\n\nI think this is a chunky game that could give many hours of play, but you have to be into this type of VR Experience \/ Simulation gameplay to get the most out of it. I do like the game design idea, but it would be easier for me to recommend if I didn't find the controls clunky and unintuitive. The worst part is how the placing or grabbing of items within drawer with precision can be frustrating especially if you are trying to play more efficiently. If the controls precision could be improved, it would make a big difference for this game.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Prison Boss VR on PSVR2 - First Impressions","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_18cxq82","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1701962042.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded gameplay from my fresh experience with the game &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/D81N_JR3bwM\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt; if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with it, I recommend playing Arizona Sunshine 2 on the PSVR2, especially if you have a friend you can play with on either PSVR2 or Meta Quest since the game supports cross-play.\n\nIt is a sequel to the 2016 original Arizona Sunshine which was a popular post-apocalypse setting zombie shooter in VR with co-op for up to 4 players. The new game adds an AI companion dog named Buddy that helps with puzzles and combat, and features a story campaign that can be played with up to 2 players or a horde mode that supports up to 4 players.\n\nThe game features a dark-humored protagonist who narrates the adventure who has gone a little crazy from lack of companionship leading up to meeting Buddy in the opening chapter, and I think it is both a great gameplay and storytelling mechanic because he isn't talking to himself only, but to Buddy when basically providing player clues or context through well acted voiced dialog. The games trailer had me concerned the protagonist would be too crass or annoying, but he is not.\n\nThe graphics in the game are among the best I have seen on the PSVR2. There is a good mix of being out in the bright and beautiful vistas of the Arizona desert and being in dark dank places as you progress through the campaign. I especially appreciate how the game has been designed to provide set-piece moments that only campaign games can provide while so many action games nowadays go the roguelite route for higher replay value, but don't have as memorable set-piece moments or campaign progression. The sound effects of zombie snarls, gun fire, explosions, etc are top notch. The game is using haptic feedback in the controllers including when petting Buddy, but I didn't feel any haptic feedback in the headset, like when taking damage from zombies.\n\nThe biggest issue I have with the game is how long the loading is. There is really long loading every time you boot up the game. There is also some loading to restore to checkpoint if you died or between chapters which have the potential to drop your co-op partner and make all network functions of the game wonky requiring a reboot of game (starting [18:00](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_jNiuQyGjuE&amp;t=1080s)). This was a one time issue in my time playing so far, but worth noting.\n\nSince I played co-op with random public matchmaking, I was able to observe some issues specific to co-op to be aware of. The items available are not instanced for each player, so it is possible for player to take both hand guns at the start and then their co-op partner has no gun until they find another much further in the game. Similarly, if one player picked up the lighter, then it isn't available for other player. Aside issues like that, which can be managed with communication, I think it is a benefit to play with another player since one of you is allowed to die and you can still progress if the other makes it through, plus I personally favor playing co-op over single player. Another issue playing co-op is the pause menu doesn't show you your next objective or stats related to collectibles etc for the level like it does when playing single player. You are also more likely to see zombies blink out of existence while playing co-op especially when you are more spread apart because presumably the game has limited memory for all the zombies it is spawning \/ despawning as needed.\n\nInterestingly, none of the people I matched with were using their microphones to communicate. I know they could hear me, and at least one of them had their mic on because I could hear myself back from their TV speaker (not part of this gameplay video), but they stayed silent for their reasons (maybe language differences? maybe just shy?). On plus side, you can see player arm, hand and finger gestures as a way to communicate so voice-chat isn't essential, but I think would be better experience for all involved.\n\nThe game is tutorial light and unobtrusive about how it tries to hint the players progression. It will provide tool tips to help you learn how to use Buddy, but aside that it expects you to figure things out for yourself. Taking things slower and exploring is rewarded with finding different hats, more ammo, different possibly better weapons (ranged or melee), and materials that can be used to craft explosives like grenades or molotov cocktails. The inventory system is not explained well, but you can basically stow two ranged weapons on either holster, different types of ammunition to your chest, and use your two wrist slots to hold 1 item each (either melee or explosives). Just like the first game, you can wear any of the hats you find which is the main form of customizing how you look to your co-op partner. You can also stick a cigar in your mouth which can be lit with a lighter (by you or your partner). I think health regeneration is tied to surviving encounters or eating food items that can be found. There are collectibles that can be found, but I either found none or am not sure how they are supposed to be collected to count.\n\nHow good the replay value is probably depends on how much better it is to play on higher difficulty after players already know how to play the game better. I also haven't tried the 4P horde mode which may be different kind of fun. But, I am happy already with having a quality single player campaign game (playable 2P co-op) that is keeping me engaged.

My first impressions are shared below:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my limited time with it, I recommend playing Arizona Sunshine 2 on the PSVR2, especially if you have a friend you can play with on either PSVR2 or Meta Quest since the game supports cross-play.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a sequel to the 2016 original Arizona Sunshine which was a popular post-apocalypse setting zombie shooter in VR with co-op for up to 4 players. The new game adds an AI companion dog named Buddy that helps with puzzles and combat, and features a story campaign that can be played with up to 2 players or a horde mode that supports up to 4 players.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The game features a dark-humored protagonist who narrates the adventure who has gone a little crazy from lack of companionship leading up to meeting Buddy in the opening chapter, and I think it is both a great gameplay and storytelling mechanic because he isn&amp;#39;t talking to himself only, but to Buddy when basically providing player clues or context through well acted voiced dialog. The games trailer had me concerned the protagonist would be too crass or annoying, but he is not.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The graphics in the game are among the best I have seen on the PSVR2. There is a good mix of being out in the bright and beautiful vistas of the Arizona desert and being in dark dank places as you progress through the campaign. I especially appreciate how the game has been designed to provide set-piece moments that only campaign games can provide while so many action games nowadays go the roguelite route for higher replay value, but don&amp;#39;t have as memorable set-piece moments or campaign progression. The sound effects of zombie snarls, gun fire, explosions, etc are top notch. The game is using haptic feedback in the controllers including when petting Buddy, but I didn&amp;#39;t feel any haptic feedback in the headset, like when taking damage from zombies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue I have with the game is how long the loading is. There is really long loading every time you boot up the game. There is also some loading to restore to checkpoint if you died or between chapters which have the potential to drop your co-op partner and make all network functions of the game wonky requiring a reboot of game (starting &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_jNiuQyGjuE&amp;amp;t=1080s\"&gt;18:00&lt;\/a&gt;).

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I recommend playing TOSS! on PSVR2, but I think fair to caution this game has potentially a steep learning curve for completionists with physically demanding gameplay that could get tiring over long enough play sessions and can be dangerous for anyone that would lose their lunch or footing in real world because of the type of VR gameplay involved.\n\nIt is a difficult game to classify because it has the feel, personality and creativity of a mascot platformer, but the gameplay of a sports game. The basic gameplay remains the same through all levels, where you can use either hand to grab surfaces and then toss \/ hurl yourself to next grab point, or jungle-gym \/ climb your way through level more cautiously.\n\nThe game doesn't require anything other than pressing green button at the end of each level to unlock next level and progress through, but for each level there are three challenges. These are Time, Grabs, and Banana (1 or more pieces) and you don't have to complete all in the same run, so you could potentially complete all three challenges over 3 different completions. Generally speaking, if you can figure out how to complete level within Grabs limit and do it without wasting time, you will get the Time challenge as well. The only challenge you can take your time with is the Banana. The only way to complete the Grabs challenges is to learn to toss \/ hurl yourself higher, faster, further which takes a physically intense motion of your arm. It would be very helpful in this game to have good power and control in both arms to grab and toss yourself around accurately.\n\nThe most thrilling part of the game is tossing yourself with intensity (and hopefully accuracy), grabbing next point, and then tossing yourself further to the green button at end of level. I didn't have any feeling of VR discomfort or vertigo or any such, but tossing yourself around fast is still dangerous with potential to hurt yourself in real life. I once slammed my controller into the ground trying to reach a green button that I was going to fly over. I also nearly lost my footing couple of times trying to stretch my arms to grab something a couple of times.\n\nAlthough basic gameplay remains same, it is a game with 8 areas (plus final bonus area) that will continually introduce new area mechanics and level challenges through the many levels included in each area \/ world so I think it has plenty of content to play through and from what I have seen, doing a good job of introducing new area mechanics and then raising complexity of the level challenge before moving on to next area \/ world.\n\nThe game features leaderboards including using PlayStation Challenge leaderboards so your friends with same game will see notifications whenever you have beat their time (similar to Sackboy: A Big Adventure). The game also shows you ghost replay of your prior completion so you can use that to compete against yourself to improve your completion time. These are not endurance races with faster completion times (at least in earlier areas I have played) all being within a minute.\n\nThe settings allow you to change from snap turning to smooth although neither are really needed as level progression is typically moving forward or up \/ down. It also lets you choose which trigger buttons are used for grabbing or allow both (R1\/R2 &amp; L1\/L2) which I think is best option. There are cosmetic unlocks that change color of your monkey hand cuffs. There is also a modifier menu in Extras that I didn't explore yet.\n\nI don't specifically remember if the game is using any haptic feedback in the controllers, so if there is any, it is very subtle. Nothing for the headset but I don't think any would be appropriate for this game either (nothing hits you). The visuals are crisp and clear and there is no loading. The soundtrack \/ effects are appropriate for the mascot platformer feel that it has.\n\nIt is fun to play, but can also be frustrating to complete challenges in the harder levels as you go through the tossing controls learning curve, so I recommend you move along and plan to come back for any challenges missed using level select at a later time.

The soundtrack \/ effects are appropriate for the mascot platformer feel that it has.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is fun to play, but can also be frustrating to complete challenges in the harder levels as you go through the tossing controls learning curve, so I recommend you move along and plan to come back for any challenges missed using level select at a later time. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":false,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/2oG4-1vgC0_RRdG2EqebZJRXAQanJxYYqJiGpvKDA2M.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=1d768793ea15f44d1d6becbd14cf7e1eed3dc335","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/2oG4-1vgC0_RRdG2EqebZJRXAQanJxYYqJiGpvKDA2M.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f9ecd2a96bdc2cba6de80b506856456c55f12ee","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/2oG4-1vgC0_RRdG2EqebZJRXAQanJxYYqJiGpvKDA2M.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38274a28b58bf63a85e48d27b1dc4f711ca72b78","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/2oG4-1vgC0_RRdG2EqebZJRXAQanJxYYqJiGpvKDA2M.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b937bfbcb03cba1db20a5e1f81cb03c8d5abe518","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"UOND9pYjEwHXoaoHt9XXbUI2UYM3piLwjb6ikzvZi-c"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"1855b1b","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1855b1b\/toss_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1855b1b\/toss_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":226391,"created_utc":1701098297.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"Hi , I am getting the Vr2 over Christmas , my mum loved the VR games on the first PlayStation Vr similar to PlayStation worlds.

I know how much better a game can be from the benefit of community feedback in that type of game development roadmap. A great example of that is how Hades became undisputed GOTY for so many in the year it left Early Access (after \\~2 years improving via community feedback) and then got stellar reviews leading to wider release beyond Steam.\n\nPlayStation really should have Early Access designation so that PSVR2 developers that want to develop their game idea with community feedback central to their roadmap (like Galaxy Kart) can use PSVR2 same way they do Steam without misunderstanding with the players served. They are doing that on Steam, so their intent is clear, but PlayStation players don't have benefit of being accustomed to or knowing that, and may purchase game initially with retail ready expectations and then be disappointed.

Many that are still working on those post-release fixes, having already earned poor reviews and disappointed early adopters.\n\nAnyway, I think any developer that wants to do post-release community feedback based development should petition and seek an Early Access designation from PlayStation for how their games release, and otherwise hold on their product until it is ready for review and retail consumer expectations because those first impressions are very important.\n\nI think vast majority of us would be fine and accepting of both type of release models. It is when a game is released with retail expectations and then has significant issues (graphics or otherwise) that we get most disappointed with games where we were otherwise on board with the game idea.\n\nMajority of PSVR2 games are coming from Independent Studios, but so was Valve Corporation when it was making Half-Life \\~25 years ago and made difficulty decision to delay rather than release a product that they believed in but was still at the suck state and not ready for retail consumers.\n\nValve wouldn't be what it is today if they weren't willing to take that long-view on the relationship they want to have with their customers.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"\"Late is just for a little while.

It is when a game is released with retail expectations and then has significant issues (graphics or otherwise) that we get most disappointed with games where we were otherwise on board with the game idea.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Majority of PSVR2 games are coming from Independent Studios, but so was Valve Corporation when it was making Half-Life ~25 years ago and made difficulty decision to delay rather than release a product that they believed in but was still at the suck state and not ready for retail consumers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Valve wouldn&amp;#39;t be what it is today if they weren&amp;#39;t willing to take that long-view on the relationship they want to have with their customers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/u4sY8gbHTAax7v7DRLek-Vu8KTpX2ipfeilSRuBVrTU.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=9bbb49bad75cd5460e45287f1ce4e88a95b00120","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/u4sY8gbHTAax7v7DRLek-Vu8KTpX2ipfeilSRuBVrTU.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74a663ea83ff08343dd9306d924e4f776748315b","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/u4sY8gbHTAax7v7DRLek-Vu8KTpX2ipfeilSRuBVrTU.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25bed6d91623bebf411f8e886d6684b0dabac7b","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/u4sY8gbHTAax7v7DRLek-Vu8KTpX2ipfeilSRuBVrTU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25198816eaa732b82ef1bc5d4b96de514b816989","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"GNObrGOrR8pnl0CJdaiUKSKOUgeYebH9Nz4Tf4CrYvI"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"de9f963c-af3a-11eb-b9d0-0e16d83a5a19","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"180k4hu","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/180k4hu\/late_is_just_for_a_little_while_suck_is_forever\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/180k4hu\/late_is_just_for_a_little_while_suck_is_forever\/","subreddit_subscribers":225978,"created_utc":1700581950.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"So I have the PSVR2 since launch - it's my first VR headset, before that I just tried it once or twice at a friend's place.

I think it is one of those games that is easy to get into, and have a long road of making the best base or taking on the best bases successfully which is why it reminds me of Guns Up! which similarly was very simple and easy to get into, but I spent 100s of hours enjoying the increasingly challenging user-created bases as I leveled up to face better invested and designed bases.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expectation of how this will continue to keep me engaged and having fun for long time is why I am highly recommending it.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/9sRZaz6-R8-FFlDTPyWZRgrxZ6LZnPJmNtb5QSDczyc.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=30a2fda72738a17ddea590871ac04951de36d8d4","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/9sRZaz6-R8-FFlDTPyWZRgrxZ6LZnPJmNtb5QSDczyc.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a8d176b8333dffaeb9bb4801aaf7e008b8b35acb","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/9sRZaz6-R8-FFlDTPyWZRgrxZ6LZnPJmNtb5QSDczyc.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=086d55e02e1bc5bf52f3471df72f8098c7cf38a0","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/9sRZaz6-R8-FFlDTPyWZRgrxZ6LZnPJmNtb5QSDczyc.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=063e17f90612355861eeed2935e500fc3709a195","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"ih8fiwXrsUIA9Jbz0IN0GQgBVUf-kox-oU5Iqi2uUgw"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"17suxq9","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17suxq9\/barbaria_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17suxq9\/barbaria_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":225484,"created_utc":1699711138.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"Judging by the score (3.92 I think) the game is obviously not everyone's cup of tea but if you are artsy type and enjoy emotional flicks this just may be the biggest emotional release game you might experience in VR - it certainly was for me.\n\nIt's under 2 hours for a playthrough so it's best experienced in one sitting.\n\nThere is some replay value since it can spun out in two ways, and there is also a rather easy platinum if you're into trophies.\n\nAnyone played it?

My first impressions are shared below:\n\nBased on my limited time with the game, I do recommend playing The Foglands on PSVR2, because I want to play more, but I have a number of precautions from my gameplay observations already to share with anyone else interested.\n\nIt is an action-adventure roguelike \/ roguelite where your task is to try and go deeper underground to take out a giant worm creature that is causing seismic activity for the underground human habitat you are part of. It appears to have a higher emphasis on NPC characters with dialog and story than typical roguelite, but I think a lower emphasis on what makes roguelite games more replayable because its combat mechanics are centered around shooting, punching, and throwing but from what I have played, it favors shooting and the starting pistol weapon which is offered every time at no scrap cost is perfectly adequate without any upgrades for all the combat required leading up to the 1st boss and I think for the boss as well. This leaves the punching and throwing unnecessary which is strange, but more on that below.\n\nThe roguelike aspect of the game involves finding purple chests that give you a choice of 3 cards that can boost various stats. Nothing that I found in what I played was particularly useful, but part of a roguelite game is improving game knowledge of possible upgrades that can influence your play style. For instance improving your melee attack knockbacks could make punching play style more useful combat option.\n\nSpeaking of punching, I found it useful to use one hand to punch any enemies that get too close while using my handgun for doing most damage, but when I tried to use both hands for punching, I found that to be a losing strategy because you can't use the thumbstick to move while you are making fists with both hands. It is more practical to shoot an enemy which staggers them, and then get close to punch them with your off hand. So I don't think a pugilist focused play style is viable here like you might expect in a roguelite that has punching as one of the combat pillars (per upgrade tree). Trying to use melee combat also makes the games enemy movement jankyness stand out.\n\nOn to throwing, the way it is implemented here has both things I liked and things that make it problematic. The way aiming and throwing works is using eye-tracking to select target and then you do throwing gesture to see the thrown object reliably find its target. It seems to only be using eye-tracking to select target for certain types of targets and there is a UI indication that remains active whether you are looking to throw something or not (maybe because you can always throw gun as well). I think this part is working well. There are also plenty of objects in all areas that can be picked up and thrown and weapons like knives can be reused after each throw by going and picking them up again. The main problem I encountered is around picking up objects quickly consistently. The game isn't using any jedi-pull to hand functionality, so you have to virtually touch to grab items (physical bending down required). But if you close your fist too early you might punch the thing you are trying to grab and break it instead of picking it up. Aside that, it doesn't separate settings for toggle holding gun vs items that may be thrown. Ideally, it should allow toggle to hold gun separate from how items (including ammunition) are grabbed and thrown (holding and releasing grip trigger instead of toggle). In Crossfire: Sierra Squad, the settings allow you to toggle hold on just gun, but lets grenades be grabbed and thrown more naturally. Something like that would be better for The Foglands as well. Lastly, you can't carry a lot of items that you can throw (with 4 inventory slots and 2 hands with 1 being used by your handgun), so this feature is good for when you are exploring or for puzzle doors \/ ramps, but not applicable to boss fights, so again, no roguelite play style focused around throwing even though your permanent upgrade tree has just three pillars (health, punching and throwing).\n\nOn to shooting, what is available from the start works well, but it can feel janky because of how weirdly the enemies move and react to being shot. There is also a slow-motion black-and-white moment that triggers but I don't understand how that benefits the player. I did find other weapons that can be picked up and used for a few shots and then with no way to reload them they have to be discarded. There are also weapons available from in-run vendor that offers to sell weapons that might be better than starting pistol. I don't know what I don't know, but I think each run will be starting with pistol and you won't get better \/ different weapons until you replay past earlier areas leading to first boss and only if you scavenged enough scrap. It seems the game lets you bank scrap instead of spending so you can use accumulation of banked scrap on subsequent run if no scavenging enough during current run. Unless you like scavenging and re-checking all the rooms each re-run, just so you will have the resources to get upgrades before boss fights, I think this could feel tedious over re-runs.\n\nAnother gameplay component worth noting are the traps like explosive barrels and oxygen canisters that can be triggered to explode. I like using such things in game, but they weren't impressing me in what I tried. If you manage to trigger an explosion near an enemy, you should be rewarded with their spectacular destruction. The explosions are happening, but don't seem to effect the enemies much. They seem to take more damage from a punch than an explosive barrel.\n\nI can't help but think this game would have been better if it wasn't a roguelite and just focused on being a single player action-adventure set in sci-fi-western-horror setting with interesting lore, characters and story with some choices provided and encouraged replay more similar to the Cave Digger games with multiple endings. I mean the type of game where you have checkpoints, like before boss fight and can retry until you succeed and then go further. In that type of game, you wouldn't have to replay a part of game that doesn't really change much on each re-run just to get to newer content. I say that because this game is fine to explore and scavenge an area the first time, but I don't think it will be fun to go through it multiple times on your way to the boss fights. Good roguelite games are ones where from start to end, there is always challenging \/ engaging gameplay (not just bosses) and choices that help shape the play style you will use for rest of your run. While they provide less content to progress through, they offer more gameplay systems and options to replay that content with. I don't think The Foglands s doing that when my next run would be starting exactly the same as my first run (with starting Pistol) and the purple chests (cards) are optional to find as you progress unlike in other roguelite where each area forces choices.\n\nAll that covered and something I hope developers can take note of to make improvements where possible, here are some positives. The game has generally higher production value than most PSVR2 games. It is built on Unreal Engine and definitely using Dynamic Foveated Rendering, although not consistently because sometimes the dialog text can be harder to read before it realizes what I am trying to look at. The soundtrack &amp; sound effects in particular are very good. The audio volume on the voice dialog could use some tuning (our character speaks too loudly), but dialog and voice acting are pretty good. I like the visual aesthetic and environmental story telling and I like the variety of rooms and sense of mystery I felt, at least first time playing through any area. The game doesn't have long \/ annoying loading screens, but there is minor frame stutter as you pass through the obvious smaller loading rooms or have to wait an extra second for a door to open if you sprinted to it too fast. If anything, it has too abrupt transition in some cases, like when taking elevator ride where the loading is to fast. Comparing to other game releases that have clear need of post-release patches, I think The Foglands has more minor issues on polish that could be fixed with patches, and potentially a bigger issues of game design (not being a good roguelite) that probably won't have any fix, but it can still be a decent action-adventure-horror game ignoring the roguelite expectation shortcomings.\n\nAnyway, these are early impressions. I realize most of it has critiques, but that is how the game was experienced today. It has possibly fundamental flaw of being a bad roguelite, and otherwise minor polish issues that add-up while also getting many things right like a game story I am interested in seeing through, graphics \/ aesthetic that is appealing, and soundtrack in particular that works exceptionally well.\n\nHappy Halloween!","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"The Foglands on PSVR2 - First Impressions","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_17ksdqg","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1698778439.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded early gameplay of the game &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7KqLgpTggME\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt; if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.

I don&amp;#39;t think The Foglands s doing that when my next run would be starting exactly the same as my first run (with starting Pistol) and the purple chests (cards) are optional to find as you progress unlike in other roguelite where each area forces choices.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All that covered and something I hope developers can take note of to make improvements where possible, here are some positives. The game has generally higher production value than most PSVR2 games. It is built on Unreal Engine and definitely using Dynamic Foveated Rendering, although not consistently because sometimes the dialog text can be harder to read before it realizes what I am trying to look at. The soundtrack &amp;amp; sound effects in particular are very good. The audio volume on the voice dialog could use some tuning (our character speaks too loudly), but dialog and voice acting are pretty good. I like the visual aesthetic and environmental story telling and I like the variety of rooms and sense of mystery I felt, at least first time playing through any area. The game doesn&amp;#39;t have long \/ annoying loading screens, but there is minor frame stutter as you pass through the obvious smaller loading rooms or have to wait an extra second for a door to open if you sprinted to it too fast. If anything, it has too abrupt transition in some cases, like when taking elevator ride where the loading is to fast. Comparing to other game releases that have clear need of post-release patches, I think The Foglands has more minor issues on polish that could be fixed with patches, and potentially a bigger issues of game design (not being a good roguelite) that probably won&amp;#39;t have any fix, but it can still be a decent action-adventure-horror game ignoring the roguelite expectation shortcomings.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these are early impressions. I realize most of it has critiques, but that is how the game was experienced today. It has possibly fundamental flaw of being a bad roguelite, and otherwise minor polish issues that add-up while also getting many things right like a game story I am interested in seeing through, graphics \/ aesthetic that is appealing, and soundtrack in particular that works exceptionally well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy Halloween!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Ux42ZpuiYmNIuSudN16lAcNmfOC_ihPeeDTscSM0pYk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=24898280bb79b8fe43e9aa7c269819864c5c584c","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Ux42ZpuiYmNIuSudN16lAcNmfOC_ihPeeDTscSM0pYk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcd34e14fbe883a94750d39e76f77799c23d93fc","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Ux42ZpuiYmNIuSudN16lAcNmfOC_ihPeeDTscSM0pYk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=395f9b185e423ee8f6867bf62bddcd90681792f9","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/Ux42ZpuiYmNIuSudN16lAcNmfOC_ihPeeDTscSM0pYk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26d283c853ff4fdee8642e47dca1777eea513503","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"wAxPlCM1H8bDE1J3CiGZEk0pipIskkj5NGZfi0-Wu2o"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"17ksdqg","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17ksdqg\/the_foglands_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/17ksdqg\/the_foglands_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":225082,"created_utc":1698778439.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"There was a lot of hype for Crossfire, it was the FPS arcade COD style(or at least, that is how it was been market).

That being said, I never had PSVR1 or bought this game.  It is worth $30 to me for its replay value.  I see this as a new part of my regular gamer dad rotation .. \n\nJust bought it today and I\u2019ve already dropped 3 hours into it - it feels like you\u2019re down at the pool hall or dorm room or friends garage or wherever u associate with playing ping pong and laughing and having a good time with friends.  I literally found myself smiling with the robot slammed it on me and I said out loud (to no one in particular) \u201cnice one buddy\u201d.  This type of experience is what VR is all about.  I have no interest in finding real life ping pong games to play as a 41 yo dad with a new baby at home, but to be able to get the fun thrill of scraping a win against increasingly difficult AI in a crazy realistic simulation of my\nFavorite sport .. it\u2019s frigging awesome.  Don\u2019t let the extra $10\u20135 throw u off.  If you love ping pong, you\u2019ll love this game.\n\nAnd for the record, I find this game much better value than C-SMASH which has amazing atmosphere and vibe and music, but just isn\u2019t nearly as much fun as good old simple ping pong.  \n\nFor extra vibe, put on a good Spotify playlist in the background.

I see this as a new part of my regular gamer dad rotation .. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just bought it today and I\u2019ve already dropped 3 hours into it - it feels like you\u2019re down at the pool hall or dorm room or friends garage or wherever u associate with playing ping pong and laughing and having a good time with friends.  I literally found myself smiling with the robot slammed it on me and I said out loud (to no one in particular) \u201cnice one buddy\u201d.  This type of experience is what VR is all about.  I have no interest in finding real life ping pong games to play as a 41 yo dad with a new baby at home, but to be able to get the fun thrill of scraping a win against increasingly difficult AI in a crazy realistic simulation of my\nFavorite sport .. it\u2019s frigging awesome.

My **second impressions** are shared below:\n\nBased on my **still** limited time with the game, for this second impression ([see first impression](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1768b35\/cosmodread_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/)), I now recommend playing Cosmodread on the PSVR2, but only if you like idea of roguelike \/ roguelite horror game set in space.\n\nThe way this game works is you start each run by landing on a space ship where the rooms are randomly generated. To clear the game, you have to complete a series of tasks to escape to Earth. Your starting area can provide you a different weapon each time, and you may find audio recordings that help complete the full narrative of the game. You may also find data discs that either contain more narrative or provide blueprints that can be used with 3D printer in a central hub area that is present in each iteration of the randomly generated ship layout.\n\nMost of the game is scavenging as you go room-to-room looking to complete the main tasks that will help you escape to Earth. Your inventory is limited, so you have to make choices on whether to carry survival essentials like extra oxygen or ammunition for your weapons, quest items that will help you complete tasks required to escape to Earth, batteries that can be used to light up areas making them safer from enemies, storage discs that you need to get to computer terminals to unlock permanent 3D printer blueprint options, or materials to feed the 3D printer to get upgrades or items to use during the current run.\n\nYou are able to carry two weapons by stowing at the holster position for either hand. I've encountered weapons ranging from sort-of-crossbow to shotgun that are single shot before requiring manual reload, and a rail gun that does a charged shot without requiring manual reload. I have also encountered ammunition for a hand-gun and possibly different type of ammo (blue vs red arrows). The game also has items like Flare Grenade that can be thrown to light up an area. These may be useful to go through a dark room without needing to use up battery for safety. One thing you may not like is how the game handles audio for weapons fire. All weapons fire sound feels muffled, and I think this is keeping with the space aesthetic, but you do hear all the creepy sounds of the creatures clearly, so it is inconsistent to me why you hear some things and not weapons.\n\nYou find plenty of batteries because all of the lighted rooms have one that you can take with consequence of making that room dark. Each battery you find may start with 1-3 chargers, but every time you move one and use in new location, it uses 1 charge, so it is a depleting resource and should be treated like the oxygen resupply. Enemies seem to only be present in dark rooms, so if you use up batteries and end up making more of the ship rooms darker, I think those areas will become more dangerous to traverse through.\n\nAs for enemies, it looks like there are 7 types based on the Hunter trophy description, and I have encountered and killed 6 of them so far. Most are alien creatures, but there is also one robot sentry enemy. I noticed that alien creature bodies will decompose if they are killed in lighted room, but if you down them in dark areas, their bodies stay, so I think they will regenerate over time in the dark rooms. Speaking of trophies, this game does not have a Platinum. There are 11 total with 4 related to main tasks, 4 that are completionist with tracking (like 6\/7 for Hunter), and rest for doing certain actions (craft item, use explosive to kill enemy, or explore 100% rooms).\n\nThis is a Unity game, so it probably isn't taking advantage of PSVR2 features like Dynamic Foveated Rendering, but I think because of how dark the game is, and you really only see what your hand affixed flashlight is pointing at, they may be using that to keep picture quality decent.\n\nThe game does use headset haptics which is most noticeable when you start a run and approach the derelict space ship. I don't think it is using that during the run when you take damage, and I don't recall noticing any haptics on the controllers when firing weapons or interacting with objects.\n\nI did not encounter hand tracking issues or controller thumbsticks not working correctly as I did during my [first impression](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1768b35\/cosmodread_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/). I still think grabbing and using items is finicky. Maybe changing settings to toggle grab \/ release instead of holding grab button will work better. The game provides good range of options for VR comfort and preferences.

You do this by mixing 3 different types of ingredients in 12 possible combinations. You can place your hand on a space to clear magic to proceed to next. The types of magic range from making things big or small, turning things into butterflies or frogs, making things weightless or magnetized, casting fireballs or making things explode into fireworks, and even giving you ability to draw anything you want in thin air, and then you can grab and use whatever you drew. One of the abilities even lets you record what the thing will do for a few seconds, so very similar to central puzzle solving mechanic in **The Last Clockwinder**, but here, at least in this learning stage, your reason to do any of these is to try them out, use your own creativity and enjoy the spectacle.\n\nThe graphics and physics simulation \/ interactions are very good. This is not a game that isn't using full potential of PS5 and PSVR2.\n\nIn the same room, you can physically interact with a xylophone musical instrument which if you play certain song will transport you to a short scene, which upon completion returns you to the room. There is also a crossbow and target practice mini-game. This room has number of secrets to uncover which generally awards trophies.\n\nThe 2nd room is where the game will introduce you to voice commands for casting spells, and give you mini-quests before you can proceed to next area.\n\nThe game is very good at recognizing voice commands, showing you text of what it thinks you are saying, and the system is intuitive and I think a good way to be able to cast so many different spells. The spells aren't limited to the 12 you learned in the 1st room. There is a broader vocabulary of possible spells and how to apply them to different objects that are available or that you cast out of thin air.\n\nWithin settings, you can also enhance the way your own voice casting sounds. The soundtrack, effects, voice dialog, your own voice commands and options to enhance your immersion is the full package here.\n\nThe 3rd room is where the game provides a wider area and it is essentially a playground where you can throw darts, shoot hoops, etc. The most important part is a wall with posters that show you a broad vocabulary of different voice commands you can use.\n\nThe 4th room is where the game wants you to learn a few more concepts and then it opens up the Observer Fortress which is where you will use everything you have learned (and more?) in whatever way makes sense to you to complete the game. I haven't gone deep into that yet, but there is a story with antagonists and combat and puzzles.\n\n**So how does local co-op work?**\n\nThe VR player has to first enable co-op mode in settings, and then another player using DualSense controller can join\/leave co-op at any time using the Options button (with DualSense controller powered and signed-in).

I also think that starting area is a good showcase for the PSVR2 for new VR players. The game has options to enable smooth movement and smooth turning, so defaults to VR safe options for new players.

My first impressions are shared below: \n\nBased on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Gazzlers on the PSVR2, but with some cautions.\n\nIt is a roguelike \/ roguelite on-rails shooter with gameplay that reminds me most of Transformers Beyond Reality that came out for PSVR2 a few months ago. Instead of moving forward, you move backwards but on similar platform from which you can physically dodge incoming projectiles, block with your shield, and otherwise focus on shooting enemies.\n\nGameplay wise, this is better than Transformers Beyond Reality because the enemies keep up the chase, and it isn't a bunch of insecticons, but Transformers Beyond Reality has better spectacle and more epic boss fights and if it matters, more of a story based progression. Being a roguelike game, Gazzlers is all about personality, not story and each time you play will also be more varied with the different types of power-ups that might be available and influence your playstyle for rest of run. The game features leaderboards and the scrap you walk away with after each run can be used for permanent upgrades like more health, shield, damage, etc.\n\nI didn't notice use of haptics when taking hits (on headset), but I think there is subtle haptic feedback when using the shield to block projectiles, and the weapon charging \/ shooting depending on mods slotted felt different (which is good). The game looks &amp; feels better in the headset than it does in the video capture.\n\nThe cautions are that I had one instance where game wouldn't proceed from game over screen where I assume it was waiting to load the leaderboard. It was a one-time problem, but only path forward was to restart the game and replay the intro mission. I think the game could use a laser pointer to make aiming traps, balloons, etc easier. Without that, you have to waste shots getting bearing and adjusting aim in a fast moving game, which leads to certain weapon mods being less viable, like I won't want to pick the power that changes weapon into a charge-up weapon.\n\nLast thing worth mentioning, someone has forgotten to publish the Trophy list, so although Trophies are unlocking, you can't see why, and you can't see what else is left on the Trophy list.

My first impressions are shared below: &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on my limited time with it, I do recommend playing Gazzlers on the PSVR2, but with some cautions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is a roguelike \/ roguelite on-rails shooter with gameplay that reminds me most of Transformers Beyond Reality that came out for PSVR2 a few months ago. Instead of moving forward, you move backwards but on similar platform from which you can physically dodge incoming projectiles, block with your shield, and otherwise focus on shooting enemies.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gameplay wise, this is better than Transformers Beyond Reality because the enemies keep up the chase, and it isn&amp;#39;t a bunch of insecticons, but Transformers Beyond Reality has better spectacle and more epic boss fights and if it matters, more of a story based progression. Being a roguelike game, Gazzlers is all about personality, not story and each time you play will also be more varied with the different types of power-ups that might be available and influence your playstyle for rest of run. The game features leaderboards and the scrap you walk away with after each run can be used for permanent upgrades like more health, shield, damage, etc.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t notice use of haptics when taking hits (on headset), but I think there is subtle haptic feedback when using the shield to block projectiles, and the weapon charging \/ shooting depending on mods slotted felt different (which is good). The game looks &amp;amp; feels better in the headset than it does in the video capture.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cautions are that I had one instance where game wouldn&amp;#39;t proceed from game over screen where I assume it was waiting to load the leaderboard. It was a one-time problem, but only path forward was to restart the game and replay the intro mission. I think the game could use a laser pointer to make aiming traps, balloons, etc easier. Without that, you have to waste shots getting bearing and adjusting aim in a fast moving game, which leads to certain weapon mods being less viable, like I won&amp;#39;t want to pick the power that changes weapon into a charge-up weapon.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last thing worth mentioning, someone has forgotten to publish the Trophy list, so although Trophies are unlocking, you can&amp;#39;t see why, and you can&amp;#39;t see what else is left on the Trophy list. This also happened to Transformers Beyond Reality and got fixed in a few days and no trophies had to be re-earned. It also happened more recently to Red Matter, but they fixed issue within 24 hours. I have also let Gazzler developers know of the issue (same way I did Red Matter developers), and they haven&amp;#39;t been as responsive about acknowledging or fixing the issue (yet). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","likes":null,"suggested_sort":null,"banned_at_utc":null,"view_count":null,"archived":false,"no_follow":true,"is_crosspostable":false,"pinned":false,"over_18":false,"preview":{"images":[{"source":{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/fTGqtIYfOyqCttGilzH5dzm_bX7v1Lc6d-PXcvDsQN4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=feab9a7343e92280f58e8184a9aa25cf2d6d73f1","width":480,"height":360},"resolutions":[{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/fTGqtIYfOyqCttGilzH5dzm_bX7v1Lc6d-PXcvDsQN4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=911d60cccdc2480f4983b35c1f1ec2618be0764c","width":108,"height":81},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/fTGqtIYfOyqCttGilzH5dzm_bX7v1Lc6d-PXcvDsQN4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64ad9fa2b8309c2075599a860d720490d5d98f4f","width":216,"height":162},{"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/fTGqtIYfOyqCttGilzH5dzm_bX7v1Lc6d-PXcvDsQN4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f8b770691119ddd2d4b233c1055c3809704132ff","width":320,"height":240}],"variants":{},"id":"BRb3zFGUX4odt2yE1UhU2EdqX7CTmz_4fVxS7c2ko4Y"}],"enabled":false},"all_awardings":[],"awarders":[],"media_only":false,"link_flair_template_id":"1222fcee-ae42-11ed-9f17-aa3eaa745a7a","can_gild":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"author_flair_text":null,"treatment_tags":[],"visited":false,"removed_by":null,"num_reports":null,"distinguished":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","author_is_blocked":false,"mod_reason_by":null,"removal_reason":null,"link_flair_background_color":"#3a88fe","id":"1726ilm","is_robot_indexable":true,"report_reasons":null,"author":"cusman78","discussion_type":null,"num_comments":0,"send_replies":true,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","contest_mode":false,"mod_reports":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"author_flair_text_color":null,"permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1726ilm\/gazzlers_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","stickied":false,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/1726ilm\/gazzlers_on_psvr2_first_impressions\/","subreddit_subscribers":223874,"created_utc":1696685636.0,"num_crossposts":0,"media":null,"is_video":false},{"approved_at_utc":null,"subreddit":"PSVR","selftext":"I have uploaded early gameplay of the game [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yu9ZkMxFj_0) if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.

There is also a Conquest Mode. Based on the trophies, the game has a little over 20 missions in total and based on PS Blog article, 6 of those missions are part of Frontline-59 Campaign.\n\n1. Mission - Take off to beat back rabid mercenary pilots from pouncing on retreating allied force.\n2. Mission - Provider aerial support to naval coastal defenses as enemy Marines make landfall.\n3. Mission - Break the enemy by clear the way for heavy hitting firepower.\n4. Mission - Using an unconventional flight plan, surprise the enemy headquarters and destroy them.\n5. Mission - Destroy the enemy invasion at its root, and send them back to where they came from.\n6. Mission - Duke it out over the Arctic Circle in an intense dogfight to put a stop to insanity.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Aerial Combat in VR is certainly a unique experience.\n* Radio chatter is decent. Soundtrack suits the game.\n* Mission variety appears to be decent.\n* At least on Easy, the first mission was Easy to make it through, even though I have no experience with aerial combat games.\n* Gun ammo is limited, but missiles are unlimited (with some cooldown mechanic in place).\n* Controls are intuitive enough that I didn't need any Tutorial (game didn't offer or force either).\n* Headset haptics are cool.\n\n**Cons**\n\n* Mission quantity is limited to 6 missions. Full game (\\~15 missions?) not playable on PSVR2.\n* Conquest Mode not playable on PSVR2.\n* It does not look as good in the PSVR2 headset as it does in the video capture.\n* Mission length may be too long and overstay welcome.\n\n**Neutral**\n\n* Doesn't use PS VR2 Sense Controllers, but DualSense is working fine for it.\n* More arcade than simulation.\n\nI liked the experience more than the gameplay. However, even within the course of playing 1 mission, I was ready for it to be over but I am also not into aerial combat games. I am glad to have tried it, hoping the mission variety in remaining 5 missions holds my attention to make this overall worth playing for me. I don't expect to want to play it beyond Easy on harder difficulties for replay value at this time. I also don't have any desire to play any of the game that isn't supported on PSVR2.

My Mini-Review of the game is shared below:\n\nBased on my time with it, I highly recommend playing C-Smash VRS on the PSVR2, especially if you like racket sports and have a friend that you can play this with.\n\nIt is a Racket Sport game probably closest to something like Racketball in real-life due to the shape of your racket and length of your handle as well as the type of enclosed arenas you play in. The game includes many modes covering an extensive single player campaign, four versus modes that can be played against bots of three different difficulties, and a co-op supporting mode called Infinity.\n\nInfinity mode can be played solo or co-op, and is a little like Tetris and Brick Breaker combined with blocks moving towards you faster with each lightyear (level) that you complete. These blocks can be destroyed by impacting with your ball. To avoid losing, you have to both physically dodge the blocks that made it to you with some mistakes allowed that distort your screen, and prevent the colored panels behind you from being destroyed by any ball that gets past you. If you take too many consecutive hits by the approaching blocks you didn't break in time, that can also lead to game over.\n\nThe four versus modes include Head-to-Head, Quickshot, Bodyshot, and Firewall. I highly recommend you set timer from default of Unlimited to 120 seconds for Firewall because it has the potential to go on for too long. My favorite among these is Bodyshot which reminds me of Sparc on the PSVR1.\n\nThe single player campaign is structured as orbital journeys where play levels and choose a path on map which informs you whether it will be more challenging or easier. I haven't spent that much time in this, but there seems to be a lot of content. Per the trophy list, there are at least 5 separate Orbit Journeys across 50 stages of content. Speaking of trophies, while some trophies can unlock while playing online multiplayer mode, 100% of the trophies can be earned solo. Most of the trophies can only be earned playing solo.\n\nThis is a highly polished game within AR, with great soundtrack &amp; style, solid gameplay mechanics that you get better at as you play), full suite of options that let you customize for VR comfort, and a history of adding meaningful free content post-release. The AI Bot you can play against while waiting for verses mode matchmaking was added. The replays at end of verses matches were added. I noticed stat tracking has been added, but only from the time that feature got added, so doesn't include your stats from before. I believe additional music tracks also got added. Last and most meaningful for me, the Infinity mode supporting co-op also got added.\n\nAside getting more modes, my only want would be to let multiplayer session move between versus and cooperative modes without having to leave and do new invites. I would also like a jump button added that make it more practical to hit the high balls.","author_fullname":"t2_nl82f","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"C-Smash VRS - Infinity on PSVR2 - Mini-Review","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Review"}],"subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","hidden":false,"pwls":6,"link_flair_css_class":"","downs":0,"thumbnail_height":null,"top_awarded_type":null,"hide_score":true,"name":"t3_16lw54e","quarantine":false,"link_flair_text_color":"light","upvote_ratio":1.0,"author_flair_background_color":null,"subreddit_type":"public","ups":1,"total_awards_received":0,"media_embed":{},"thumbnail_width":null,"author_flair_template_id":null,"is_original_content":false,"user_reports":[],"secure_media":null,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_meta":false,"category":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"link_flair_text":"Review","can_mod_post":false,"score":1,"approved_by":null,"is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"author_premium":false,"thumbnail":"self","edited":false,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"gildings":{},"post_hint":"self","content_categories":null,"is_self":true,"mod_note":null,"created":1695045075.0,"link_flair_type":"richtext","wls":6,"removed_by_category":null,"banned_by":null,"author_flair_type":"text","domain":"self.PSVR","allow_live_comments":false,"selftext_html":"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have uploaded gameplay of all the multiplayer modes in the game &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0C5hS-mWNY8\"&gt;here&lt;\/a&gt; with majority of time spent playing Infinity mode in co-op if you want to see how it looks \/ plays.
