The game looks and runs great on my Radeon 6900XT, but my headset, which is by far the easiest and most straightforward to use on PC, doesn't have the best screen nor the best sound, and has no IPD adjustment.\n\nThe experience on PS5:\nI turn the PS5 on, put the VR and Pulse headsets on my head while the console boots and I power everything on. Once in, I can grab my controllers that I can see with the passthrough and log in. I launch the game, my play space is confirmed, and I'm in.\nThe game looks pretty much as good on PS5 because it's well optimised, plus here the headset has good screens, IPD adjustment and much better audio. Another interesting thing: on PS5, loading into your save from the main menu is near instant.\n\nSo, yeah, you might hear from the PC snobs that PCVR is the best experience out there. It's not.

Previous titles include VEV, the 2MD: VR Football series (on PSVR, PC, Quest, and now PSVR2), an otome visual novel called Akash: Path of the Five on PS4, PC, and Switch, more PS4 dynamic themes than I can count (which included work for over 70 studios both large and small along with nearly a hundred or so independent theme projects), contractual work for other developers, and more recently our game RUNNER for PSVR2 \/ Quest 2 and Quest Pro:\n\n[RUNNER PSVR Trailer](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JHvovSg85ZY)\n\n**RUNNER** started development in mid 2019.  We had just finished our work on 2MD: VR Football Unleashed for Quest, and had wanted to try something novel in the VR space that was a little more action oriented and a little more fast paced.  After discussing what kind of approach we'd like to take, we settled on the idea of a driving \/ shooting game.  At the time, games like GTA offered the ability to drive \/ ride a motorcycle without the ability to precisely aim and shoot a weapon; this seemed a great fit for VR, as that offered the possibility of more granular control than the standard flatscreen + dpad or mouse+keyboard interface. \n\n I had a draft plot and some earl concept art for an action game set in a Neo-Tokyo style off-world dystopia that fit the bill in terms of setting, and quickly went to work prototyping the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The earliest concept art for the game.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jqk22yxg891b1.jpg?width=778&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d7ee48c4f5ff264d81624630c72efced05a3c4b)\n\nWe soon realized that, if we wanted to do the setting justice (being huge fans of Akira and similar prestige anime of the late 80's and early 90's) we would need some extremely efficient engine implementations to be able to do crowded cityscapes at high speeds in VR.  No smoke and mirrors, no stationary gameplay.\n\nOur programmer came up with (what I still think) is a brilliant design we dubbed the 'Road As You Go' system;  it's designed to efficiently use as little of the limited available memory as possible by generating the road and nearby terrain in real-time as the player progresses through the stage.  Building placement is procedural, based on a number of factors including the curve \/ elevation of the road, the proximity to structures like bridges and overpasses, and the player's current progress through the level, and a number of other important criteria tied to the current performance of the game:  \n\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oc2r153h291b1.jpg?width=949&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=902c8ec7469de22d5db425b398c6e044aeb0db17\n\nWe also needed a way to actually create the stages themselves:  At first, we wrestled with ways to do sprawling layouts that were both sensible but unique; we quickly ran into bottlenecks in terms of memory, however, and subsequently decided on a system that generates the road upon a dynamically predetermined path using waypoints and a pathing system; The fun aspect here being the level layout could be completely unique EVERY time the level was loaded, promising something slightly different each time.  It allowed us to develop static elements (like certain superstructures) that players might not see the first or even second time they play, allowing them to potentially discover something new with each playthrough.\n\nWe finally had a working prototype in the closing months of 2020, that looked a little something like this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This bike went through A LOT of design iterations!](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vpctlnxk281b1.png?width=2031&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42e98574b0c76095a1d1663537fbe8b51e0c9efc)\n\nThe early months of 2020 were...not great.  let's leave it at that.  But one benefit of everyone being stuck at home, was we could continue to iterate the look of the experience as well as the gameplay.\n\nEventually, I settled on pursing the old-school anime look, out of both an overwhelming sense of nostalgia for series like Cowboy Bebop, Bubblegum Crisis, Trigun, Evangelion, and the like, as well as a need to take advantage of a visual style that would be performant at 200 MPH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The look starts to take shape](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5fb94zpa381b1.jpg?width=1339&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4f7a4caa44397caeed30c6a5ab26bb1d7ef731d)\n\nConcurrent to the visual and gameplay design, sound design also got a great deal of attention early on.  We partnered with Fat Bard, an incredible duo responsible for some incredible soundtracks for indie and larger releases alike, to find the right kind of Neo-80's music feel without eschewing TOO much into synthwave.  The goal was to fuse 80's metal \/ rock, with a healthy dose of J-pop as well as Japanese city pop and even a little 90's game music thrown in for good measure.  Once the main '[theme](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B5C-FsqK5EI&amp;t=8s)' was nailed down, that easily informed the rest of the soundtrack, with pieces that were themed more closely to the stages themselves.  All of this was tied together to a dynamic music system that actually changes during the course of play (nothing exactly new, I know, but still fun nonetheless).\n\nAt this point, we had a working product and had iterated both the visual, audio, and gameplay enough to where we could announce the game.   Repurposing some concept art I'd worked on a while ago, we came up with a visual design guide and story:\n\n[Early artwork still used the old bike design, but you can see where this is headed.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yz4udlz7781b1.jpg?width=1291&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae165a9fba727a6f32835a7ef8fc2650f560ad4c)\n\nOur announcement would serve two purposes:  one, we wanted to let people know what we were working on, and two, we wanted to pitch the game.  In particular, we were hoping for a partnership with Sony, and expressed a desire to develop the game for the PSVR successor.  We'd heard the same rumors as everyone else with regards to what the hardware might entail, and the possibility of advanced controller haptics and HMD vibration were tantalizing.  We also had had a great experience working with Meta on the Quest, and wanted to see if we could adapt the game to the Quest 2 as well.\n\nOur pitch 'deck' utilized further iterations of our artwork, coupled with some impressive work by a very skilled artist named Shea who, despite never having drawn in the '80's' style, quickly adapted and helped give our protagonist her identity.  In order to really capture the feel of the era, we dressed up our entire pitch deck as a feature in a fictional game magazine circa 1990...\n\n[I had to dig out an old EGM to get the formatting just right...](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/09qcup1o781b1.jpg?width=1477&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0fd76fbca326a220c137fde94172f33e2237f23c)\n\nAfter out announcement, development continued;  Now, one thing that really stands out to me in terms of then vs now, is how the gameplay interface changed when expectation met reality:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Stared at this alot, let me tell you...](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hnjlusdh881b1.jpg?width=1137&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd9fd95433869430086a5c23e1bb809c52558e44)\n\nSo initially, we had a '**natural**' grab-and-use style interface.  The pistols were always integrated into the control system of the bike, and players would use the grip button of their VR controller to hold on and steer, or detach and shoot.  similarly, players would also have to let go of the handleguns (as we called them) to grab grenades from the center console.  We became very proficient at this over the initial 2 years of development, and thus, were incredibly dismayed to see that, when placed in test players' hands, it wasn't working.\n\nPlayers constantly **dropped** the guns, or **missed** the handles when reaching out to grab them.  players would often spend agonizing seconds trying to find the handles or grenades, having to resort to taking their **eyes off the road and look around** the center console to locate them, which resulted in more traffic **collisions**, more **disorientation**, and even more **motion sickness**. Interestingly, this issue was actually worse for some players otherwise experienced in VR first person shooters, in part because the fast paced nature of the game heightened the urgency to complete these tasks. Yeah, it was a total surprise, but the proof, as they say, was in the pudding.\n\nFor this reason, we went back to the drawing board.\n\nWe realized that while 'natural' motions made sense in theory, and worked well in stationary or slower-paced experiences, they definitely did not translate into effective or fun gameplay when players were tasked with doing things at high speed; This is essentially why people are warned against distracted driving in real life: *your effectiveness at performing multiple tasks drops dramatically when you have to divide your attention between them.* \n\nfor that reason, we settled on a '**hybrid**' system that used button presses to quickly switch between driving, shooting, and grabbing grenades.  And players adapted to it quickly, resulting in much better performance across the board when compared to the old control system: as in, even players that excelled in terms of score with the old system absolutely dominated with the new one, it was no contest.  We did consider, for a moment, creating the option of switching between systems, however it became a major concern that people would opt for the familiar rather than the effective, so we focused our resources on perfecting the new system since it worked far better in the long run.  (Additionally, trying to shoehorn a second system in there now would, to put it bluntly, be a total nightmare.)\n\nPart and parcel with this, was how we wanted to approach motion sickness:  We'd long ago learned the do's and don't 's of VR for stationary experiences, but up to that point fast paced or mobile ones proved to be a challenge.  We subsequently focused on developing a philosophy of minimizing those elements that most often resulted in discomfort.  Here are a couple of screenshots from our pitch deck that summarized the approach:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o8nzm0iea81b1.jpg?width=784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67a2570e4fe4abda40ac0d362cef65b69a8e4ad6\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xwcaesjfa81b1.jpg?width=928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be768e2e7eff6d18fc707501048342ca537bf504\n\nOnce these elements were well in place, we spent the rest of the development cycle further iterating the look and feel of the game.  We gave each level its own visual character, and created enemy types and boss battles that took advantage of those themes. \n\nFor those of you who've stayed with me this far (or at least browsed the pretty pictures), here's another chance at a free copy of the game! \n\n&gt;!US: 94NH-Q5N7-METK!&lt;\n\n&gt;!US: P4R2-QDN8-C9RA!&lt;\n\n&gt;!EU: T3HM-P9NQ-CL92!&lt;\n\n&gt;!EU: XFGN-N3NM-R7A6!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/5y0rcj9qq81b1.gif\n\n We also got to live the dream of working with some of the voice actors that actually worked on those anime that INSPIRED the look of the game in the first place, like **Steve Blum, Richard Epcar**, and some incredible contemporary talent like **Sandra Saad**.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/up7yxsu4t81b1.gif\n\nI believe it was around this time the PSVR2 was formally announced, and we were subsequently onboarded for development. We had originally planned a simultaneous release in October of 2022 for PSVR2 and Quest, however as yall know that didn't really play out.  The game was released on Quest first, and thankfully had a very good response.  We did get some important feedback with regards to the difficulty, however, and quickly set about tweaking that aspect of the game while incorporating those changes into the PSVR2 code.  One thing we did was create a **'Free Play' mode**, that essentially suspends the failstate, so folks could experience the entirety of the main game without dying, and unlock stages for re-play with free play mode disabled.  We did this in lieu of 'easy,' 'normal' or 'hard' modes as we quickly learned that difficulty is extremely granular and extremely divisive; indeed, there weren't necessarily common denominators in terms of what certain players found to be difficult during gameplay: for some folks, it was the controls; for others, the encounters were too fast. So, we made a number of major tweaks to all of these things, added more contextual hints throughout the game, decreased enemy difficulty across the board, until the general consensus was the game offered a reasonable challenge.  **This evolution is still ongoing even now, as we just pushed an update a few days ago that further added contextual hints for various encounters.** Difficulty is probably the hardest aspect of the gameplay to get perfect, ironically, rather than the technology itself.  \n\nAmong other things, PSVR2 allowed for a much higher visual fidelity (native panel resolution at 90 hz without reprojection**)** , and more importantly we were finally able to implement weapon and HMD haptics that we'd been dreaming about.  \n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ispvhqwvb81b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c9531756abdcd31c62a07d91f9ac5edbe56cbf1\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6meewaga991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=354ef27a324aa38fdf7026a6ac1ce4693a067345\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4x127q08991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e7ec179fdda912735e95d1cf852c6b7e2145272\n\nWe also got to take advantage of the PS5 social screen, creating a couch-co-op 2 player mode that I'm really proud of.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0wx5mat4991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=623b6dc85a9aa47c791c63e07cdf3803e6b07340\n\nIn the end, we lucky enough to create a largely bug free and stable experience, despite all the procedural systems at play.\n\n[The final piece](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ga1bpxos891b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d90c56c3f654eb502b78681a7f2aa588fb9e6a4)\n\nI'm gonna yadda yadda a few things since this post is already getting waaaay too long and I'm pretty sure I've lost some folks.  At the moment, we're working on some additional updates and new content for the game, once all of the quality of life improvements are out of the way.  in a way, the staggered nature of the PSVR2 retail launch has helped, as we've been able to improve the pain-points of the game by leaps and bounds.  In addition to the improvements in difficulty, we've buffed the saber (the melee weapon in the game) to be a more effective combat option, tweaked a bunch of the powerups, added a huge compendium of enemies and boss hints to give players a leg up before each encounter, to name a few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/mlxfhkh1t81b1.gif\n\nSo that's the bulk of it.  there's reams of more boring stuff I could mention, but this covers the main points.  So, if you have questions, feel free to ask, I'll answer when I can!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\\\\\"Nice Catch!\\\\\"](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/pwduleeov81b1.gif)","author_fullname":"t2_1cdo3f28","saved":false,"mod_reason_title":null,"gilded":0,"clicked":false,"title":"Hi Reddit!

&lt;strong&gt;Hello&lt;\/strong&gt; once again everyone...it seems this is becoming a bit of a &lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/9ncw9g\/ama_were_truant_pixel_creators_of_2md_vr_football\/\"&gt;tradition&lt;\/a&gt; for us, we&amp;#39;re now in the post launch period of our game RUNNER for PSVR2 (and previously Meta Quest 2).  We did request an AMA slot, however there wasn&amp;#39;t any response on that end, so we&amp;#39;re going to frame this as both an AMA but also a post-mortem of our latest game \/ obsession for the newly minted PSVR2.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will start by talking about the development of the game, and answering some of the more commonly asked questions that have come up since launch.  This subreddit has always been a nice opportunity to pull back the curtain on occasion to make sense of the sometimes perplexing choices we as developers have to make in the course of creating our games, and perhaps get some helpful feedback in how we can improve on our future endeavors!  This is by no means comprehensive (that would fill up a book) but I did want to talk about some key points in the dev process.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before we start, here are some free keys for the game (first come, first serve!)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;US: PJ55-JBNN-9FDL&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;US: 8RCJ-3ANX-QTEA&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;EU: H54T-G9N2-3TTX&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;EU: P4NX-82NC-FP5B&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with us, Truant Pixel is a small 3 person team dedicated to making videogames that fit our diverse and divergent interests.  Previous titles include VEV, the 2MD: VR Football series (on PSVR, PC, Quest, and now PSVR2), an otome visual novel called Akash: Path of the Five on PS4, PC, and Switch, more PS4 dynamic themes than I can count (which included work for over 70 studios both large and small along with nearly a hundred or so independent theme projects), contractual work for other developers, and more recently our game RUNNER for PSVR2 \/ Quest 2 and Quest Pro:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JHvovSg85ZY\"&gt;RUNNER PSVR Trailer&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RUNNER&lt;\/strong&gt; started development in mid 2019.  We had just finished our work on 2MD: VR Football Unleashed for Quest, and had wanted to try something novel in the VR space that was a little more action oriented and a little more fast paced.  After discussing what kind of approach we&amp;#39;d like to take, we settled on the idea of a driving \/ shooting game.  At the time, games like GTA offered the ability to drive \/ ride a motorcycle without the ability to precisely aim and shoot a weapon; this seemed a great fit for VR, as that offered the possibility of more granular control than the standard flatscreen + dpad or mouse+keyboard interface. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a draft plot and some earl concept art for an action game set in a Neo-Tokyo style off-world dystopia that fit the bill in terms of setting, and quickly went to work prototyping the game.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/jqk22yxg891b1.jpg?width=778&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=4d7ee48c4f5ff264d81624630c72efced05a3c4b\"&gt;The earliest concept art for the game.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We soon realized that, if we wanted to do the setting justice (being huge fans of Akira and similar prestige anime of the late 80&amp;#39;s and early 90&amp;#39;s) we would need some extremely efficient engine implementations to be able to do crowded cityscapes at high speeds in VR.  No smoke and mirrors, no stationary gameplay.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our programmer came up with (what I still think) is a brilliant design we dubbed the &amp;#39;Road As You Go&amp;#39; system;  it&amp;#39;s designed to efficiently use as little of the limited available memory as possible by generating the road and nearby terrain in real-time as the player progresses through the stage.  Building placement is procedural, based on a number of factors including the curve \/ elevation of the road, the proximity to structures like bridges and overpasses, and the player&amp;#39;s current progress through the level, and a number of other important criteria tied to the current performance of the game:  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oc2r153h291b1.jpg?width=949&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=902c8ec7469de22d5db425b398c6e044aeb0db17\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oc2r153h291b1.jpg?width=949&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=902c8ec7469de22d5db425b398c6e044aeb0db17&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also needed a way to actually create the stages themselves:  At first, we wrestled with ways to do sprawling layouts that were both sensible but unique; we quickly ran into bottlenecks in terms of memory, however, and subsequently decided on a system that generates the road upon a dynamically predetermined path using waypoints and a pathing system; The fun aspect here being the level layout could be completely unique EVERY time the level was loaded, promising something slightly different each time.  It allowed us to develop static elements (like certain superstructures) that players might not see the first or even second time they play, allowing them to potentially discover something new with each playthrough.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We finally had a working prototype in the closing months of 2020, that looked a little something like this:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vpctlnxk281b1.png?width=2031&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=42e98574b0c76095a1d1663537fbe8b51e0c9efc\"&gt;This bike went through A LOT of design iterations!&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The early months of 2020 were...not great.  let&amp;#39;s leave it at that.  But one benefit of everyone being stuck at home, was we could continue to iterate the look of the experience as well as the gameplay.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I settled on pursing the old-school anime look, out of both an overwhelming sense of nostalgia for series like Cowboy Bebop, Bubblegum Crisis, Trigun, Evangelion, and the like, as well as a need to take advantage of a visual style that would be performant at 200 MPH.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5fb94zpa381b1.jpg?width=1339&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=d4f7a4caa44397caeed30c6a5ab26bb1d7ef731d\"&gt;The look starts to take shape&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Concurrent to the visual and gameplay design, sound design also got a great deal of attention early on.  We partnered with Fat Bard, an incredible duo responsible for some incredible soundtracks for indie and larger releases alike, to find the right kind of Neo-80&amp;#39;s music feel without eschewing TOO much into synthwave.  The goal was to fuse 80&amp;#39;s metal \/ rock, with a healthy dose of J-pop as well as Japanese city pop and even a little 90&amp;#39;s game music thrown in for good measure.  Once the main &amp;#39;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=B5C-FsqK5EI&amp;amp;t=8s\"&gt;theme&lt;\/a&gt;&amp;#39; was nailed down, that easily informed the rest of the soundtrack, with pieces that were themed more closely to the stages themselves.  All of this was tied together to a dynamic music system that actually changes during the course of play (nothing exactly new, I know, but still fun nonetheless).&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, we had a working product and had iterated both the visual, audio, and gameplay enough to where we could announce the game.   Repurposing some concept art I&amp;#39;d worked on a while ago, we came up with a visual design guide and story:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yz4udlz7781b1.jpg?width=1291&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ae165a9fba727a6f32835a7ef8fc2650f560ad4c\"&gt;Early artwork still used the old bike design, but you can see where this is headed.&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our announcement would serve two purposes:  one, we wanted to let people know what we were working on, and two, we wanted to pitch the game.  In particular, we were hoping for a partnership with Sony, and expressed a desire to develop the game for the PSVR successor.  We&amp;#39;d heard the same rumors as everyone else with regards to what the hardware might entail, and the possibility of advanced controller haptics and HMD vibration were tantalizing.  We also had had a great experience working with Meta on the Quest, and wanted to see if we could adapt the game to the Quest 2 as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our pitch &amp;#39;deck&amp;#39; utilized further iterations of our artwork, coupled with some impressive work by a very skilled artist named Shea who, despite never having drawn in the &amp;#39;80&amp;#39;s&amp;#39; style, quickly adapted and helped give our protagonist her identity.  In order to really capture the feel of the era, we dressed up our entire pitch deck as a feature in a fictional game magazine circa 1990...&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/09qcup1o781b1.jpg?width=1477&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0fd76fbca326a220c137fde94172f33e2237f23c\"&gt;I had to dig out an old EGM to get the formatting just right...&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After out announcement, development continued;  Now, one thing that really stands out to me in terms of then vs now, is how the gameplay interface changed when expectation met reality:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hnjlusdh881b1.jpg?width=1137&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=dd9fd95433869430086a5c23e1bb809c52558e44\"&gt;Stared at this alot, let me tell you...&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So initially, we had a &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;natural&lt;\/strong&gt;&amp;#39; grab-and-use style interface.  The pistols were always integrated into the control system of the bike, and players would use the grip button of their VR controller to hold on and steer, or detach and shoot.  similarly, players would also have to let go of the handleguns (as we called them) to grab grenades from the center console.  We became very proficient at this over the initial 2 years of development, and thus, were incredibly dismayed to see that, when placed in test players&amp;#39; hands, it wasn&amp;#39;t working.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Players constantly &lt;strong&gt;dropped&lt;\/strong&gt; the guns, or &lt;strong&gt;missed&lt;\/strong&gt; the handles when reaching out to grab them.  players would often spend agonizing seconds trying to find the handles or grenades, having to resort to taking their &lt;strong&gt;eyes off the road and look around&lt;\/strong&gt; the center console to locate them, which resulted in more traffic &lt;strong&gt;collisions&lt;\/strong&gt;, more &lt;strong&gt;disorientation&lt;\/strong&gt;, and even more &lt;strong&gt;motion sickness&lt;\/strong&gt;. Interestingly, this issue was actually worse for some players otherwise experienced in VR first person shooters, in part because the fast paced nature of the game heightened the urgency to complete these tasks. Yeah, it was a total surprise, but the proof, as they say, was in the pudding.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this reason, we went back to the drawing board.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realized that while &amp;#39;natural&amp;#39; motions made sense in theory, and worked well in stationary or slower-paced experiences, they definitely did not translate into effective or fun gameplay when players were tasked with doing things at high speed; This is essentially why people are warned against distracted driving in real life: &lt;em&gt;your effectiveness at performing multiple tasks drops dramatically when you have to divide your attention between them.&lt;\/em&gt; &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;for that reason, we settled on a &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;hybrid&lt;\/strong&gt;&amp;#39; system that used button presses to quickly switch between driving, shooting, and grabbing grenades.  And players adapted to it quickly, resulting in much better performance across the board when compared to the old control system: as in, even players that excelled in terms of score with the old system absolutely dominated with the new one, it was no contest.  We did consider, for a moment, creating the option of switching between systems, however it became a major concern that people would opt for the familiar rather than the effective, so we focused our resources on perfecting the new system since it worked far better in the long run.  (Additionally, trying to shoehorn a second system in there now would, to put it bluntly, be a total nightmare.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part and parcel with this, was how we wanted to approach motion sickness:  We&amp;#39;d long ago learned the do&amp;#39;s and don&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;s of VR for stationary experiences, but up to that point fast paced or mobile ones proved to be a challenge.  We subsequently focused on developing a philosophy of minimizing those elements that most often resulted in discomfort.  Here are a couple of screenshots from our pitch deck that summarized the approach:&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o8nzm0iea81b1.jpg?width=784&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=67a2570e4fe4abda40ac0d362cef65b69a8e4ad6\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/o8nzm0iea81b1.jpg?width=784&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=67a2570e4fe4abda40ac0d362cef65b69a8e4ad6&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xwcaesjfa81b1.jpg?width=928&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be768e2e7eff6d18fc707501048342ca537bf504\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/xwcaesjfa81b1.jpg?width=928&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=be768e2e7eff6d18fc707501048342ca537bf504&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once these elements were well in place, we spent the rest of the development cycle further iterating the look and feel of the game.  We gave each level its own visual character, and created enemy types and boss battles that took advantage of those themes. &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those of you who&amp;#39;ve stayed with me this far (or at least browsed the pretty pictures), here&amp;#39;s another chance at a free copy of the game! &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;US: 94NH-Q5N7-METK&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;US: P4R2-QDN8-C9RA&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;EU: T3HM-P9NQ-CL92&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;EU: XFGN-N3NM-R7A6&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/5y0rcj9qq81b1.gif\"&gt;https:\/\/i.redd.it\/5y0rcj9qq81b1.gif&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also got to live the dream of working with some of the voice actors that actually worked on those anime that INSPIRED the look of the game in the first place, like &lt;strong&gt;Steve Blum, Richard Epcar&lt;\/strong&gt;, and some incredible contemporary talent like &lt;strong&gt;Sandra Saad&lt;\/strong&gt;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/up7yxsu4t81b1.gif\"&gt;https:\/\/i.redd.it\/up7yxsu4t81b1.gif&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe it was around this time the PSVR2 was formally announced, and we were subsequently onboarded for development. We had originally planned a simultaneous release in October of 2022 for PSVR2 and Quest, however as yall know that didn&amp;#39;t really play out.  The game was released on Quest first, and thankfully had a very good response.  We did get some important feedback with regards to the difficulty, however, and quickly set about tweaking that aspect of the game while incorporating those changes into the PSVR2 code.  One thing we did was create a &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;Free Play&amp;#39; mode&lt;\/strong&gt;, that essentially suspends the failstate, so folks could experience the entirety of the main game without dying, and unlock stages for re-play with free play mode disabled.  We did this in lieu of &amp;#39;easy,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;hard&amp;#39; modes as we quickly learned that difficulty is extremely granular and extremely divisive; indeed, there weren&amp;#39;t necessarily common denominators in terms of what certain players found to be difficult during gameplay: for some folks, it was the controls; for others, the encounters were too fast. So, we made a number of major tweaks to all of these things, added more contextual hints throughout the game, decreased enemy difficulty across the board, until the general consensus was the game offered a reasonable challenge.  &lt;strong&gt;This evolution is still ongoing even now, as we just pushed an update a few days ago that further added contextual hints for various encounters.&lt;\/strong&gt; Difficulty is probably the hardest aspect of the gameplay to get perfect, ironically, rather than the technology itself.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among other things, PSVR2 allowed for a much higher visual fidelity (native panel resolution at 90 hz without reprojection&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;\/strong&gt; , and more importantly we were finally able to implement weapon and HMD haptics that we&amp;#39;d been dreaming about.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ispvhqwvb81b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c9531756abdcd31c62a07d91f9ac5edbe56cbf1\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ispvhqwvb81b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8c9531756abdcd31c62a07d91f9ac5edbe56cbf1&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6meewaga991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=354ef27a324aa38fdf7026a6ac1ce4693a067345\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6meewaga991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=354ef27a324aa38fdf7026a6ac1ce4693a067345&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4x127q08991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3e7ec179fdda912735e95d1cf852c6b7e2145272\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4x127q08991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=3e7ec179fdda912735e95d1cf852c6b7e2145272&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also got to take advantage of the PS5 social screen, creating a couch-co-op 2 player mode that I&amp;#39;m really proud of.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0wx5mat4991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=623b6dc85a9aa47c791c63e07cdf3803e6b07340\"&gt;https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0wx5mat4991b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=623b6dc85a9aa47c791c63e07cdf3803e6b07340&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the end, we lucky enough to create a largely bug free and stable experience, despite all the procedural systems at play.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ga1bpxos891b1.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2d90c56c3f654eb502b78681a7f2aa588fb9e6a4\"&gt;The final piece&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m gonna yadda yadda a few things since this post is already getting waaaay too long and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I&amp;#39;ve lost some folks.  At the moment, we&amp;#39;re working on some additional updates and new content for the game, once all of the quality of life improvements are out of the way.  in a way, the staggered nature of the PSVR2 retail launch has helped, as we&amp;#39;ve been able to improve the pain-points of the game by leaps and bounds.  In addition to the improvements in difficulty, we&amp;#39;ve buffed the saber (the melee weapon in the game) to be a more effective combat option, tweaked a bunch of the powerups, added a huge compendium of enemies and boss hints to give players a leg up before each encounter, to name a few.&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/mlxfhkh1t81b1.gif\"&gt;https:\/\/i.redd.it\/mlxfhkh1t81b1.gif&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#39;s the bulk of it.  there&amp;#39;s reams of more boring stuff I could mention, but this covers the main points.

I figured I'd just copy and paste my response to him here because I'm curious to know what your initial reactions have been. Sorry for the formatting, but I didn't feel like going through and cleaning this up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n i haven't spent a ton of time with it yet, but my initial reaction to the psvr2 is that it's a little underwhelming. the construction feels pretty cheap. i'm not a big fan of the rubber around the headset itself that is supposed to block out light. it isn't snug and lets in light no matter how i position the headset. it kind of reminds me of a crappy version of the nintendo virtural boy design. you cannot adjust the vertical tilt,  which i think is ridiculous. feels nowhere near as comfortable as the quest 2 imo. there are a lot of UI things that are lacking in my opinion. there is no \"home\" environment like with the quest. when you put the headset on you end up looking at kind of a janky version of the home screen. the system menu feels clunky when you are in a game. they don't render the controllers when you are in menus outside of games unless you are in the boundary set up, which is surprisingly annoying,  especially if you need to adjust them. this also means that if you are typing stuff on the keyboard, you have to select the letters just like you would with a normal gaming controller instead of having the ability to aim and select. they didn't end up adding any kind of web browser, which is super lame. they also made the stupid decision to split the scrolling and selection buttons on the controllers, which means that you really need both of them all the time to navigate through menus, instead of being able to navigate around with just one like you can with the quest 2. the graphics are decent, but there is definitely still a slight screen door effect from the fresnel lenses, and even with the brightness at 50%, there is a ton of glare in lighter scenes. i feel like the fanboys were really overblowing their reviews in pretty much every aspect including immersion. it feels no different than the quest 2 in terms of that. like i say, i haven't done a ton of actual gaming with it yet, so hopefully, my opinion will change in that regard. i had time to do some of the resident evil demo before the controllers needed to be charged. the graphics on that were noticeably better than anything that i  have played on the quest 2, which is cool, but the way the ring controllers are designed, it kind of makes it feel weird when you are trying to do stuff like 2 hand weapons. probably just me not being used to them yet. based on my very limited experience so far, i'm questioning my purchase a little bit. if it was in the $300 range, that would be one thing, but this just doesn't have the quality and feel of something that cost just as much as the console itself. i'm hoping that it is going to grow on me over time and I'm looking forward to giving it another shot when i get home today.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","subreddit_subscribers":205995,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PSVR2

Will I fall in love and unlock my inner Vin Disel Or should I just Kayak my way through the vR world? \n\nAlso any recommendations for accessories in general? I wear glasses so for sure getting the lens adapters that work with prescriptions. I\u2019m not too worried about dust, I have 4 pets, my ps5 gets dusty all the time, I just use my handheld keyboard vacuum to get the corners my duster can\u2019t.. \n\nAnyways just good vibes all around! I\u2019m happy to find this subreddit with just as excited people! To end with another question: If you had to pick ANY game to have a vr adaptation (no matter if the mechanics wouldn\u2019t make sense) what would you pick? I would chose the ENTIRE Bioshock series. I\u2019d love to experience Rapture as well as Colombia (though being a poc, Colombia may be my worst choice.) \n\nCheers &lt;3\n\nEdits for spell correction","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","subreddit_subscribers":206051,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The pressure is getting worse","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.82,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/110kawd\/the_pressure_is_getting_worse\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":false,"author":"TheCruelGruul","author_created_utc":1402513161,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_gxx88","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"banned_by":null,"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1656015183,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"vj5ys6","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"#edeff1","link_flair_css_class":"","link_flair_richtext":[{"e":"text","t":"Question"}],"link_flair_template_id":"090fc818-af4c-11eb-ada4-0e6fd107f82b","link_flair_text":"Question","link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"richtext","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_vj5ys6","no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/vj5ys6\/any_suggestions_using_radtv_without_a_controller\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1657098119,"retrieved_utc":1657098119,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","subreddit_subscribers":182382,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Any suggestions using rad.tv without a controller?

I figured I'd give it a try and 20 minutes later it actually worked.\n\nMy source was 4K video, and while the PSVR doesn't display that high due to encoding this guaranteed I wasn't going to see any artifacts (i.e. even to play on 1080P, a 4K encoding is simply better due to compression). The setup is I connect my PSVR box to my PC HDMI, the USB to my PC&lt; and then Trinus mirrors my desktop and automatically sets the resolution to 1920 x 1080. I am using VLC and mouse and keyboard to navigate, only the PSVR to display.\n\nThe results were amazing and beyond expectations. Video quality was way better than even PS4 VR games, since the videos were often close ups with a lot of detail to enjoy. I spent weeks enjoying this and glad I could dust off my old device and put it to use.\n\nI couldn't get Trinus to connect with Steam, and I also couldn't get it to play top\/down VR videos. So I figured, I liked the experience, why not get a newer PC device like Vive or Oculus Rift? Browsing through my options, I bought the Oculus Quest 2 - btw if you do this, buy directly from them - way cheaper than through Amazon ($300 plus tax vs $500+ on Amazon).\n\nAccording to research, the Quest 2 should be almost 2x the resolution wide, 2x the resolution high. Plus it lets me browse VR, play VR games (apart from Steam), and presumably connect to Steam. It took 40 minutes to setup, considerably longer than the PSVR due to updates and apps I needed just to make the device to PC connection (long explanation I'll skip).\n\nUnfortunately, while I'm sure it does all of that extremely well, it does not do 3D video nearly as well as the PSVR. Long story short, while having a higher resolution, the screen and FOV is way bigger. It is also very inconvenient, even after installing multiple apps.\n\nWorst of all, the video decoder simply sucks compared to VLC. 4K video looks like 1080p on the PSVR. On the 4K Quest 2, it literally looks between 480p and 360p due to all the artifacts. I believe this is either a decoding issue or bandwidth issue (the same happens when you play a 4K video on a bad video player or a hard drive that can't stream fast enough).\n\nThe problem mostly goes away when I play games or browse and stream video, so it looks to be a decoding issue. I could 'replicate' the issue on the PSVR by dropping my 4K video onto a slow hard drive, or playing it on a bad video player. I'm going to try 1080p and 720p VR and see if that helps with Oculus, but what's the point of even using it for that then! It's very clear from to bottom that Quest 2 was not designed for decoding local files like I've been doing with the PSVR.\n\nApart from the over-the-top decoding artifacts, again the super wide view stretches out the video too much. I know there are other views I can use, but that has the extreme opposite problem. I can go 2x stretched or 1\/2x zoomed in, but literally not in-between. I've tried multiple players and the better ones give only those options, most don't even. I'll be fiddling around for a while more before asking the forums if there's a way around this, but google doesn't show any hints of a solution (people post this issue but the answers are worthless including 'check your IPD' which is certainly not going to fix a super-stretched view problem.\n\nThat said, I think the kids are going to love the Oculus Quest 2 for gaming and nature shows.\n\n*Edit: At some point I might write a review of the Quest 2 after putting a lot more hours into it, but the tldr is it has a lot of features, content, and potential, but is incredibly frustrating to use and set up. My first 3 minutes I ran into a 'well known' issue where it literally won't connect to wifi -* [*Oculus.com*](https:\/\/Oculus.com) *literally says the fix is to download the app to your phone, pair it, reboot the phone, reboot oculus. I've had to use a dozen hacks in the first hour just to get it to play a single

is a bit of a TIFU kind of post. I've always been one to enhance my gaming experiences with a little weed. I've also always been a bit of a lightweight when it comes to weed tolerance, and usually stick to micro doses, slowly building myself up to a giggly state. But I've been building up my tolerance over several months and yesterday I thought, \"ok child's play is over, I can handle my shit now let's get nice and melted\". So I pack the bong and let it rip a few times. I was really pumped as I just bought like 8 new games from the sale. So I was really excited to discover them for the first time in this extra \"woh, look at my hands\" kind of state. \n\nIt did not take my long to realize I had gone too far with the green stuff. The first game I loaded up was I Expect You to Die.  For those who don't know, it's sort of a puzzle game where you have to find ways to complete pretty simple objectives without dying. And every time you fuck up, you die somehow (so far it's always been by poisonous gas). The particular level I was playing has me starting outside a high-rise as a window washer (disguised). Guys... I WAS the window washer. There was a bottle of fuckin windex and everything and a sponge and you could actually clean the windows and it got visibly cleaner. There was even a lunch box with a sandwich in it. I was so impressed by all this. This wasn't even really part of the game, these were just fun little extra immersion features. But it became more than that for me. I had to figure out a way to get inside the building's window to stop some kind of super virus from getting created or something. There was a pistol there on my scaffold as well. I used it to shoot the glass window but kept dying as there were laser traps inside which kept getting triggered and sending out poisonous gas as a defense mechanism. I died a few times that way; always looping back to my window washer start with my windex and my sponge. I started to think this was my life. I'm a window washer. It became way too much for me to handle, I had to change games.\n*close application. \"get it together man\". \n\nJob simulator was next on my list. That'll save me from this state of mind that's been slowly creeping up on me. I had always heard this game was hilarious so the mood should be a bit lighter too. \n\nI only last about 5 minutes. The floating office worker robots were making me uneasy. What the hell did they want? I was new at this job and I was worried I wouldn't be doing it properly and they would realize I was an imposter. Then the \"boss bot\" came over to check on me and mentioned the promotion I've been waiting for. He told me \"if you don't screw up in the next 10 seconds, it's yours\". I've never felt so observed in my life. That 10 seconds was intense. Picking up the phone, pretending make a call, pushing random buttons on my keyboard. It was all a joke in the end, of course. The gag was that no matter what I did, he would be pleased, and he was. But, once again, it felt too real for me. \n\n*close application. \n\"maybe I should stop playing?\" And just be alone with my thoughts and nothing to distract me? Hell no. I really had to chill though. Hopefully my high would level off. \n\nSo anyways this cycle went on and on for a little bit more with different games. Ghost Giant seemed like a good idea as well. But when you're literally a Giant Ghost watching over a little cat friend, it's a lot of responsibility. It didn't really make me feel any better. The mood wasn't right for this. I thought Pistol Whip might be good. But it was way too intense, I couldn't even finish one song, it's like I was way over stimulated. \n\nThe game that finally did the trick was Espire 1: VR Operative. Maybe my high had leveled off a bit, but I also been playing this for the past week or so, so I knew it was just a game to have fun with and not take too seriously. I think that helped. The other games were maybe too new to me in the fried state I was in. \n\nThe first thing I tried was a climbing challenge I had been trying to beat for about an hour earlier in the day (when I was sober). It was the one with the zip line at the end for anyone who's played it. I must have lost in the level about 30 times previously. I loaded it up and smashed it. First try. My heart was beating through my chest, it was exhilarating. Getting to the finish using a zip line was one of the most intense VR experiences I've had. Keep in mind it's only because of my special context here. Don't expect to try this climbing challenge and be as excited as I was lol. \n\n\nNow for some actual missions. Let me tell you, I never snuck so well in my life. Crawling up on people, holding them up, knocking them out with my fist, dragging their bodies to better hiding places. I felt like a stealth master. The slow motion feature is a lot of fun too. I think there was still a part of me taking the game way too seriously, which made me extra focused on not being stupid. It was really rewarding to beat a mission this way. \n\nSo that's my story. Even though I ended up having a lot of fun, I think it's back to micro dosing for me. I'm not trying to encourage people to smoke, but some of the best gaming moments have been assisted by weed (Trover was an insane example of this). I just want to make sure the less experienced people out there take it easy because VR is so immersive it can really take over lol. This is also why I love VR though and I wouldn't have had it any other way. Just play responsibly. \n\nThanks for reading! \n\nAnyone have any similar stories to share?","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_subscribers":167990,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"PSA: Do not smoke too much weed and play VR","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.38,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/jqghsr\/psa_do_not_smoke_too_much_weed_and_play_vr\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":false,"archived":true,"author":"MR_KILL777","author_created_utc":1515798843,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_qojmfiy","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"can_gild":true,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1604801632,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":1604801812.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"jq3j2l","is_created_from_ads_ui":false,"is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"name":"t3_jq3j2l","no_follow":true,"num_comments":5,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/jq3j2l\/any_recommendations_for_a_good_mouse_and_keyboard\/","pinned":false,"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_utc":1623061503,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hey there!

are some of the things we can expect for the PSVR2, based on patents that have been disclosed so far, Sony related articles and my expectations for the technology by 2021\/2022. This of course does not mean they are guaranteed to happen, just that it is a possibility.\n\n**Gaze\/Eye tracking**\n\n-How it works: \n\nJust like the name says Gaze\/Eye tracking allows the headset to know where you are looking at on the screen. The biggest limitation of adding eye tracking to VR headsets is cost, but the price of adding this should be greatly [reduced](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2020\/03\/24\/nvidia-develops-lightweight-vr-gaze-tracking-system-using-led-sensors\/) by 2021\/2022.\n\n-What it will allow:\n\nFoveated rendering: Is a technique that allows to reduce graphical detail on the parts of the screen you are not focusing on. You won't notice any image degradation because everything you are not looking at is out of focus and it's not reaching the part of the retina that captures more detail (fovea).\n\nExample of how foveated rendering increases performance on the [Vive Pro Eye](https:\/\/blog.tobii.com\/realistic-virtual-vision-with-dynamic-foveated-rendering-135cbee59ee7). It can help to reduce graphics load by up to 70.75%. The Vive Pro Eye tracks the eyes at [120hz](https:\/\/imotions.com\/hardware\/tobii-htc-vive-vr-headset\/), but it is likely this will be increased on the PSVR2, to allow even more aggressive performance savings.\n\n [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NyMxwch\\_00E](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NyMxwch_00E) \n\n [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvBlXho4RhA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DvBlXho4RhA) \n\n-PlayStation\u2019s Dominic Mallinson: \u201cI think that the gaze tracking is the most exciting change that we\u2019ll see in next-gen VR,\u201d Mallinson declared. \u201cSo really, if you look at the history of user input, starting off with keyboards, and then the mouse, and recently touchscreen interfaces, I seriously think that having gaze as a user input is going to be as fundamental as each of those changes we\u2019ve had in the past. That\u2019s my number one point about next-generation VR: Gaze will allow much, much richer user interaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore pixels needs more rendering performance,\u201d Mallinson explained. \u201cIf you just brute force it, it requires a lot of extra rendering performance. The human eye has a part in the retina called the fovea, which is responsible for our super-sharp vision. We don\u2019t see very much in the peripheral vision. So if we can match our rendering performance to the fovea, we can deliver higher effective resolutions, and also better quality images. So gaze tracking is a win-win in this respect.\u201d\n\n[Sony patent link](https:\/\/vrgear.com\/news\/sony-finalizes-patent-for-prescription-eye-tracking-glasses-to-use-with-vr-headset\/)\n\nIris login: Your Iris is unique so it can be used for the headset to identify who is putting it on and automatically log you in to your account or game save file. This can also be used for parental control.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.eff.org\/es\/pages\/iris-recognition)\n\n**Hand tracking**\n\n-How it works: By using multiple capacitive sensors on the controller it is possible to track every single finger in your hand.\n\n-What it will allow: A greater level of expression and interaction in VR.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vro2w7zj4yy41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a3cd2b353155bebd1d2aceacc5e8aa3b9109fe7\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IZpgjymt9Xc](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IZpgjymt9Xc) \n\n[Sony patent link](https:\/\/www.thesixthaxis.com\/2020\/02\/20\/psvr-ps5-finger-tracking-controller-psvr2\/)\n\n**Facial Tracking**\n\n-How it works: Dedicated sensors to track eye and mouth movements.\n\n-What it will allow: For you to express better what you feel in a virtual environment. This will greatly enhance the experience on VR social interactions and can even be used for NPCs in a game to have a better idea of what are you feeling and where are you focusing your attention.\n\n [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v3XcQtoja\\_Y](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v3XcQtoja_Y) \n\n [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xMgoypPBEgw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xMgoypPBEgw) \n\n[Sony patent link](https:\/\/mp1st.com\/news\/playstation-vr-facial-tracking-patent-aims-to-deliver-more-realistic-experiences)\n\n**Wireless**\n\n-How it works: Just like the name implies, it means sending a wireless signal from the processing device to the VR headset. Having a wired connection to the PC\/gaming console is still a major factor that takes you out of being immersed, so I think we can be pretty sure that by 2021 the PSVR2 will be wireless.\n\n-What it will allow: Greater immersion and quality of life improvement in VR.\n\n-PlayStation\u2019s Dominic Mallinson: \u201cUser comfort is incredibly important in order to widen the adoption of virtual reality,\u201d Mallinson emphasized. \u201cThere are many aspects to user comfort. I\u2019m just going to touch on one here. And that is the cable. Being tethered to this cable is inconvenient. And it\u2019s not just about getting tangled up in the cable. It\u2019s not just about the restriction in your motion. It\u2019s also about how you set things up, how you configure the system, where you store it. Let\u2019s face it, having a mess of cables in your living space is just not attractive. So this is something that we have to solve in order to get wider adoption.\u201d\n\n[Sony patent link](https:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2019\/10\/09\/playstation-vr-2-wireless-headset-revealed-new-sony-patent-10889803\/)\n\n**Inside out tracking**\n\n-How it works: The headsets does its own positional tracking, instead of depending on external sensors to track the headset movements.\n\n-What it will allow: Makes the setup process a lot easier to do, as you don't need to dedicate space or time to setup the external sensors.\n\n**New Sony Patent Points To Inside-Out Tracking For VR Headsets**\n\n\"Many people in the virtual reality (VR) industry believe that inside-out tracking is the future of consumer-grade HMDs. We\u2019ve seen prototypes from Oculus with Santa Cruz and Intel\u2019s Project Alloy-powered devices and now Sony is dipping their toes into the inside-out tracking race. Today we caught wind of a new Utility Patent Application from Sony Interactive Entertainment that would allow for inside-out tracking of interactive VR devices.\n\nThe full patent application was originally filed back on December 6th, 2016, just two months after Oculus\u2019 Santa Cruz prototype was announced. The patent application\u2019s Abstract is difficult to parse, but what\u2019s being described sounds similar to existing prototypes and methods of using an inside-out tracked VR headset.\"\n\n[Sony patent link](https:\/\/uploadvr.com\/new-sony-patent-filed-inside-out-vr-tracking\/)\n\n**Higher resolution panel**\n\n-How it works: A higher resolution panel compared to the 1920 x 1080 one on the PSVR, means a higher concentration of pixels.\n\n-What it will allow: Greater definition on whatever you see on your headset.\n\nPlayStation\u2019s Dominic Mallinson: \u201cThis is more pixels per degree. It\u2019s about the sharpness and the clarity of the display. And you have to be able to match what people expect to see today with high definition. I would expect the resolution to roughly double in the next set of VR products.\u201d\n\n**Sony-backed Japan Display launches new high-end VR screens that could power PSVR 2**\n\n\"Japan Display, a joint venture between Sony, Hitachi, and Toshiba, today announced separate 1,001-pixel-per-inch (PPI) and 803PPI displays specifically designed for VR use. While the new screens boast visual improvements that set the stage for a second-generation PlayStation VR, they also hint at a future market trend in VR design: lower-size, lower-weight headsets.\"\n\nJapan Display claims that as \u201ceven more compact-size LCDs and higher magnification lenses are required to decrease the size and weight of HMD devices,\u201d only \u201cover 1000PPI\u201d options will be sufficient to actually shrink headsets. So it appears that the joint venture\u2019s 803PPI screens are intended for headsets roughly as large as current options, while the 1,001PPI screens will go into smaller, lighter units.\n\nUnlike the current PSVR screen \u2014 a single 5.7-inch, 1,920 by 1,080 panel that uses OLED technology \u2014 both of the new screens are eye-specific LTPS TFT-LCDs, featuring \u201cIPS designed for VR.\u201d Notably, only the higher-end 1,001PPI screen can match the current PSVR\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate, as the lower-end 803PPI screen has a maximum 90Hz refresh rate \u2014 enough for most VR apps, but with higher system latency.\"\n\n[Source](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2018\/05\/10\/sony-backed-japan-display-launches-new-high-end-vr-screens-that-could-power-psvr-2\/)\n\n**HDR**\n\n-How it works: It allows a panel to display a higher contrast or color range between the lightest and darkest tones in an image.\n\n-What it will allow: More believable and color rich worlds in VR.\n\nPlayStation\u2019s Dominic Mallinson:  In the TV industry, HDR is already incredibly important to creating the best experiences. The human eye sees an enormous range of light from bright sunlight to deep shadow. Today\u2019s VR panels only capture a tiny fraction of that. So in order to increase the sense of presence, I do expect to see HDR adopted in the near future.\u201d\n\n[Source](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/05\/23\/playstations-dominic-mallinson-on-next-gen-vr-wireless-gaze-tracking-foveated-rendering-and-ar\/amp\/)\n\n**Wider field of view**\n\n-How it works: Most current VR headsets have a 100 to 110 degrees of horizontal field of view, the normal human vision has a range of around 180\/220 degrees. This is the main reason why it can feel like you a wearing a scuba mask when using a VR headset.\n\n-What it will allow: Allow you to view VR worlds in a way that takes more advantage of your full field of view.\n\nPlayStation\u2019s Dominic Mallinson: \u201cwe also need a greater field of view,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe human visual system is out to about 180 degrees. Most VR headsets today are about 100 degrees. There are diminishing returns to get wider. But I would expect the next set of products to be roughly 120 degrees in terms of field of view.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2019\/05\/23\/playstations-dominic-mallinson-on-next-gen-vr-wireless-gaze-tracking-foveated-rendering-and-ar\/amp\/)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_subscribers":167919,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/b.thumbs.redditmedia.com\/aKd8PQ92OSlOHR2cFOUl_sVOnYqH788KErdiXLdSEOc.jpg","thumbnail_height":78,"thumbnail_width":140,"title":"Reasonable expectations for the PSVR2","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.64,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/gkb27r\/reasonable_expectations_for_the_psvr2\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6},{"all_awardings":[],"allow_live_comments":true,"archived":false,"author":"laviddang","author_created_utc":1412353149,"author_flair_background_color":null,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_flair_template_id":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author_flair_text_color":null,"author_flair_type":"text","author_fullname":"t2_iotwu","author_patreon_flair":false,"author_premium":false,"awarders":[],"can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"category":null,"content_categories":null,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1582091635,"discussion_type":null,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"hidden":false,"id":"f66ap4","is_crosspostable":true,"is_meta":false,"is_original_content":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_robot_indexable":true,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_background_color":"","link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_richtext":[],"link_flair_text":null,"link_flair_text_color":"dark","link_flair_type":"text","locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"media_only":false,"no_follow":true,"num_comments":1,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/f66ap4\/anyone_ever_use_a_reasnow_crosshair\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"-2iL06TGUx9Pp6ctwDIcjzux9_P9xbA7fCqMSF7wfQ4","resolutions":[{"height":117,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/j4s6AYIHCpfNKIJN6s_ab__38qY1qLP04zBxVtBu_D4.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6f977cf1ad1306497ac3e66a12b0bba5c09d66c5","width":108},{"height":234,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/j4s6AYIHCpfNKIJN6s_ab__38qY1qLP04zBxVtBu_D4.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ad440786ecca0c74b169a1213fe2bc9d04c2935","width":216},{"height":347,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/j4s6AYIHCpfNKIJN6s_ab__38qY1qLP04zBxVtBu_D4.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=256861bc36ff504929a5f778ce968f7f1c4313fe","width":320}],"source":{"height":380,"url":"https:\/\/external-preview.redd.it\/j4s6AYIHCpfNKIJN6s_ab__38qY1qLP04zBxVtBu_D4.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=4b0c52a71a78388a4222e058dc07461331955ce7","width":350},"variants":{}}]},"pwls":6,"quarantine":false,"removal_reason":null,"removed_by":null,"removed_by_category":null,"retrieved_on":1587426767,"score":3,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"It's a device used to convert different controllers for different games like using a mouse and keyboard on PS4.

So I posted a very short video of a 6 yr old playing beat saber. And holy shit... you would\u2019ve thought I was gouging his eyes out myself the way you all responded. So here\u2019s the backstory no one fucking asked for but you\u2019re getting it anyway because this is the dumbest shit I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nSo, to start our journey let me introduce you to the family! The child playing is the youngest of 3, his 2 older sisters are 12 and 15. Also present are his dad and stepmom, then my girlfriend and I. (My girlfriend being his step sister) \n\nNow, they live 4 hours away in BFE and we\u2019re here for the night visiting. The event they were here for wasn\u2019t at my house, my gf had told the kids about my VR and they asked if they could come play for a bit before they drove home that night. So when they came over and I was setting it up his parents told him \u201cno, you\u2019re too small to play.\u201d Obviously him being 6 and watching everyone else have a blast, he lost his shit. So after about 20 minutes of crying they said fuck it and let him have a turn right before they left. He played one song twice, failed both times, and only had the damn thing on for a total of maybe 90 seconds. He was satisfied, said he was too short to play but can\u2019t wait to come back when he\u2019s taller because \u201cTHAT WAS THE COOLEST THING EVER!\u201d\n\nTHAT WAS FUCKING IT! I fail tremendously to see how that\u2019s \u201chorrible parenting\u201d. A minute and a half won\u2019t make the kid blind assholes.

Also I can get GZDoomOpenVR and QuakeSpasmOpenVR to load up fine too. But it seems each game has its peculiar issues which makes it a bit buggy to play for me. I was wondering if anyone has tried these out?  \n\n\nI am using GZDoom Open VR [(https:\/\/github.com\/Fishbiter\/gz3doom\/releases)](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/(https:\/\/github.com\/Fishbiter\/gz3doom\/releases)) for Doom, and it seems to have missing weapon sprites (I recorded a little video of it  [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fFDhx8j3l1U](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fFDhx8j3l1U) ). Perhaps it thinks my head position is too far forward and is putting the sprites behind my head?  \n\n\nThen I am using QuakeSpasm Open VR [(https:\/\/github.com\/Fishbiter\/Quakespasm-OpenVR\/releases)](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/(https:\/\/github.com\/Fishbiter\/Quakespasm-OpenVR\/releases)) for Quake. But QuakeSpasm Open VR seems to have weird issues with turning on the xbox controller. I heard it works better with mouse and keyboard, but the aiming is still off center. Maybe there is some way to do a manual recentering, and run the controller through a mouse and keyboard configuration it will work better. I will try that soon.  \n\n\nI tried older and different forks of VR in GZDoom and Quakespasm, which I had a hard time to even get to open. If I make any more progress I'lll keep the topic updated.

Already at this early stage, we have been keeping a close eye on your impressions and feedback, for which we are very grateful. We are taking your feedback on board and intend to address as much of it as possible as we continue to support the game with regular updates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that in mind, we are very pleased to share with you some updates on the game\u2019s post-launch development, both in the short and the long term!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**April 2019 Updates**\n\nEarly next week, we will be deploying a patch which includes some minor bug fixes and balancing adjustments. More detailed patch notes can be found on the forums [here](https:\/\/forums.ubi.com\/showthread.php\/2029723). This patch will be followed by a free content update in the middle of the month. Please be aware that you will be required to install these updates as they become available in order to continue playing online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Features in development**\n\nThe development team in Montpellier is hard at work to bring the following to the game later on in the year:\n\n* New game modes\n* New maps\n* New characters\n* And more!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019re also very happy to confirm that **PS Move support is in the works**!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Known technical issues**\n\nWe are aware that some of you are using keyboard LED controller software that is being flagged by Easy Anti-Cheat, leading to issues when attempting to launch the game. Rest assured that this issue is already under investigation, and we hope to address it soon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In-game currency clarification**\n\nWe thought we\u2019d clarify the game\u2019s currency system to avoid any confusion.Let us be very clear off the bat: Space Junkies has no microtransactions!

It's now possible to interact using a touch bar with commands and\/or using the normal menu pointer. Choose your preferred way in the settings menu.\n* Improved Free Locomotion: It's now possible to use the head direction to control where to go. Choose HMD from the settings menu.\n* Improved Free Locomotion: Default walk &amp; sprint speeds have been raised. \n* Smooth Turning: Max speed has been raised.\n* Improved Battle Experience: Changed toggle arrow to cycle arrows meaning it's now possible to cycle all arrows without having to use the inventory.\n* Added Comfort Options: It's now possible to disable \"blinking\" when teleporting\/rotating.\n* Improved Hand Interactions: Hand movement when hands are clenched or holding items is much smoother.\n* Level Design Tweaks &amp; Balancing Fixes: For instance, the mission called \u201cThe Device\u201d is a little easier now!\n* Bug Fix: Fixed potential tech hang when using sliders in the menus.\n\nThanks for all the feedback you have provided!

It's a free to play Moba\/rts game in VR and it has endless replay value if you are into competitive multiplayer, this game will keep you hooked. And its free! There is literally no reason not to download it and give it a try when the barrier to entry is free and not pay to win either! However you can choose to pay to progress and get the heroes faster if you wish. If you have ever liked any moba or rts game before then you will be happy to know that it blends both genres together to make a top down hero focused moba and real time strategy game at the same time.\n\nThink Warcraft 3, but way more hero focused like a moba instead while also keeping some simplified rts elements such as base\/army building with a variety of different towers and different minion upgrading trees.\n\nThese type of games rarely get released on console to begin with cause they always go to PC instead. But Sunsoft has made a way to bridge the gap between mouse and keyboard and controller by using the PS moves and they work flawlessly here for this type of moba\/real time strategy game and its the first of its kind in VR! Don't sleep on this gem it has potential to be an esport! just like dota 2, league of legends, or even how Warcraft 3 was in the past.\n\nGive it a shot, even if you did not like moba\/strategy games on flatscreen, then VR may be what finally converts you over to it. There are people online playing every day......because its free and fun! Let me know what you think! I'm open to discussion and I will answer any questions you have about the game that may be stopping you from playing.\n\nDark Eclipse Game - [https:\/\/www.playstation.com\/en-us\/games\/dark-eclipse-ps4\/](https:\/\/www.playstation.com\/en-us\/games\/dark-eclipse-ps4\/)\n\nUser Guide - [https:\/\/userguides.eu.playstation.com\/en\/dark-eclipse\/](https:\/\/userguides.eu.playstation.com\/en\/dark-eclipse\/)\n\nOfficial Discord - [https:\/\/discord.gg\/aFVweU](https:\/\/discord.gg\/aFVweU)","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/PSVR","subreddit_subscribers":79689,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Don't Sleep On Dark Eclipse!!!

For example, the default view will always stay upright on the track, instead of rolling with ship. Using the \"Pilot View\" let me experience barrel rolls in all of their 360 degree-flipping-upside-down glory! And of course, the view will roll on turns as you would expect. I never once felt sick (but then I never do).\n\nIt's amazing how much detail can be seen just sitting at the starting grid; the pilot's hand on the control stick, the HUD info, and even small streaks of dirt on the glass above you. Looking around, I noticed the spectating crowds and the buildings, and small details that I would've never notice before, like the futuristic floating 3D exit sign in the crowd stands. Once I started moving, the sense of speed is exhilarating and no compromises have been made to the graphics. I can hear weapons firing from behind, or the rockets launch from the ship next to me. The framerate never dropped. It really is one of the best looking and sounding VR games to date!\n\nBut Wipeout's VR isn't just great for it's immersion and experience. VR actually gives me a significant gameplay advantage. I can't exactly put my finger on what it is; maybe it's the ability to peer further around corners to anticipate obstacles more easily, or perhaps it's having a better sense of distance between the environment and my ship. Whatever it is, the advantage is so massive that I was literally able to finish off the HD campaign, getting Gold in every single event, without even one failure; a feat that I previous thought was far beyond my ability.\n\nI've been doing perfect laps in Phantom class. I've heard more \"New Lap Record\" announcements tonight than I can count (at least 20 times I think).\n\nIf my experience tonight is any indication, online play is going to be severely unbalanced in favour of VR players from now on. I think the difference will be as big as that between FPS players using keyboard and mouse vs. those using controllers. Maybe even bigger.

I've played alot of PSVR,and don't get nauseous or motion sickness usually at all.Played through Skyrim, RE7,Solus Project,etc, and have always went with smooth turning,but for some reason the smooth turning in this game gives me a headache and makes me a little nauseous.Skyrim,and Solus Project turning are abit faster or smoother or something,so it doesn't give me any issues,but this game does.The slow smooth turning seems like its not slow enough and seems to stutter when turning,and the medium and fast smooth turn options seems like its not smooth and fast enough,which results in abit of motion sickness (and this coming from someone who never or very rarely gets motion sickness in VR).\n\n\n-Click Turning\/Rotation- So you'd think that rotation and click turning would work fine,but nope.Instead of just putting the left and right click bottons on the X and O buttons on one hand like Skyrim and Solus Project did,you have to hold the triangle button while flicking your hand in the motion you want to turn in.This is annoying enough,but if it worked correctly,then I wouldn't mind so much,but it doesn't work either.Most times when you flick it in the direction you want to move,it will do a 180 flip turn instead.\n\n\n-LeftHanded Mode- (EDIT: This issue seems to be completely fixed in the latest patch 1.02.Seems to work perfectly now) Okay,I'm lefthanded,so I really appreciate it when VR games add the option of swapping hands and\/or having a lefthanded mode (so kudos to the developers for at least trying to add in a lefthanded mode and giving us the option to swap hands). Exploring and managing your inventory that I had the most problems with,so much so that I would say lefthanded mode is broken outside of combat really.For starters sometimes the game will revert you back to righthanded mode\/right handed pointer when you go back to the house and main menu.\n\nThe main issue, however, is the frustrating inventory system that is completely broken for lefthanded players.Usually when you pick up a keycard or item,you can bring up your menu on the other hand,and put it in a slot in your inventory.In lefthanded mode,the inventory menu is on the right hand,and you point and pick up things with your left hand.But if you pick up anything you want to put in your inventory (like a keycard), it will NOT open.I'll be holding the keycard or item in my lefthand,and trying to open up the inventory on my right hand by pressing the appropiate button to place it in an empty slot,but no matter how many times I press it,it just makes a sound and doesn't open.Instead,I have to switch hands,holding the item in my right hand,then have to open the inventory menu with my right hand by pressing the button,then once the inventory menu opens,I'll have to grab the keycard\/item with my left hand again, hope the inventory doesn't close and use my left hand to put it in the inventory slot.This is so ridiculous,and I literally have to do it every single time I pick up an item that I want to put into my inventory.It would be nice if it actually worked like it was supposed to,and let me pick up the item with my left hand,open my right hand inventory menu with the button on my right hand,and just put it in the inventory slot,but the inventory just will not open in my right hand while holding the item in my left hand.\n\n\n-Health Cans-EDIT:I found out that you have to hold the move button and keep having it tilted upward to drink it.\n\n\n-No Pause Menu or Access to Settings in Game- I can't believe you can't access the options\/settings in game,or even access any type of pause menu.If you want to pause the game or change your settings,and your half way through a mission, you only have the option of returning to the home base,or going to the menu screen,which takes you out of the game,and you have to restart the mission again.You can't even pause the game,since there is no pause menu.\n\n-Keycards Falling Through Floors- Just thought I'd update to post about another really frustrating glitch I found. I accidentally dropped a keycard and it fell through the floor (clipping through the floor I suppose), and wasn't able to get or pick it up again,so I had to get all the back to get another one.Be careful if you drop a keycard, you might not be able to pick it back up again if this glitch happens to you.\n\n-Enemies Clipping Through Walls- Yep,had some enemies clip through the walls and get stuck in various walls,and doors,making it impossible to hit or defeat them.\n\n\n-No Subtitles,and No Audio Option- I'm very surprised this game doesn't have any subtitles.I usually wouldn't mind,if the game has audio options that you can turn down the music and sfx and make the voice audio louder,but it doesn't have any audio options for that either. Seeing as you have to listen to audio files on computers,and have to hear Fathr (and he can be hard to make out at times due to his gravelly robotic voice),you'd think they would've had subtitles,or had audio options that allow you to turn down the music and special effects audio.\n\nI entered a room in the game that had a very noisy generator next to one of the computers.The sound of the generator was almost defeaning,Fathr started talking to me when I entered this room,and I couldn't even make him out or what he was saying.And when I tried to listen to the Audio file on the computer of Fathr and Mothr talking,I couldn't make them out or hear them much at all, since the loud noise of the generator in the room was so loud (thankfully you can still read what they are saying in the computer files,but thats not the point).\n\nPlease give us more audio options to turn these audio effects and music effects down,or at the very least let us be able to turn up the volume of the voices,or have subtitle options,so we can make out what the characters are saying,so they won't be drowned out by the background noise,music and effects.\n\n\n-And lastly, the screen and hand jittering and drifting.I never usually have any problems with my move controllers drifting much in many games,but the move controllers and hands in this game constantly jitter\/shake and drift away from me,even after resetting my PS camera multiple times. \n\nAlso,when going up to a computer,or table to try to pick something up or interact with the computer\/keyboard, the screen will jump, and drift or move a little bit further each time I try to take a step towards the computer and keyboards,which is very frustrating. I know its not my set up since I tried it with other games,and it works perfectly,its only this game that seems to have this problem.\n\nAnyway,as I said I don't post often,I'm more of a lurker really,but this game was so frustrating that I just had to post about my problems.I just hope the developers see this,and are able to fix and patch alot of these issues,cause I really do want to continue playing and enjoying this game,but all these issues have broken the game,and made it unplayable for me in its current state.\n\nEDIT: Kudos to the developers for listening to the community and addressing some of these issues with the latest patch.Hopefully they are working to improve the rest of the issues for the next patch.\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Apex Construct - Broken Mess That I Hope Improves (My Issues)","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7zateh\/apex_construct_broken_mess_that_i_hope_improves\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"theVRgrid","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1519249011,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"7z9bev","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"no_follow":false,"num_comments":7,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7z9bev\/in_apex_construct_this_is_what_using_the_keyboard\/","pinned":false,"post_hint":"self","preview":{"enabled":false,"images":[{"id":"89YCBMfb2XV5LDSdi6hXwAIpiEvftHMwYZJ6rq_8zn0","resolutions":[{"height":81,"url":"https:\/\/i.redditmedia.com\/YRzaxsYdskR1Lg48HRGQcGRKvyei84qTvObVIOIBiyo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=d92d5cf96b4294b26b732ed2bc02cb22","width":108},{"height":162,"url":"https:\/\/i.redditmedia.com\/YRzaxsYdskR1Lg48HRGQcGRKvyei84qTvObVIOIBiyo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=d6075fa371064f4df36483db1b9087d1","width":216},{"height":240,"url":"https:\/\/i.redditmedia.com\/YRzaxsYdskR1Lg48HRGQcGRKvyei84qTvObVIOIBiyo.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;fm=jpg&amp;s=cc27386b477a89517a2bc735682cb46c","width":320}],"source":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.redditmedia.com\/YRzaxsYdskR1Lg48HRGQcGRKvyei84qTvObVIOIBiyo.jpg?fm=jpg&amp;s=8d13312ff5778c72108199e50c28eb9d","width":480},"variants":{}}]},"retrieved_on":1520576999,"score":36,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/OqjF7HKSaaI","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"In Apex Construct, this is what using the keyboard feels like.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7z9bev\/in_apex_construct_this_is_what_using_the_keyboard\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"Sirius_amory33","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1519240534,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"7z863b","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"no_follow":false,"num_comments":17,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7z863b\/apex_construct_is_great_on_paper_but_not_so_great\/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1520576361,"score":7,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I feel like this game has a high ceiling and can be a solid game well worth having in your collection but, at the moment, it needs more work and a patch or two from the devs. The bow controls worked great for me, I love the look of the game, and when I was searching around the opening area I found two glowing orbs that gave me RP so it\u2019s cool that the game rewards your exploration. I also really like that it seems like the world will be structured like Dark Souls or a Metroidvania where you unlock connections that build a larger, cohesive world. But there were things that made it seem like the game wasn\u2019t properly play tested or truly ready for launch.\n\nI had to restart the opening area a couple of times because of control issues and there\u2019s no way to access the settings in-game. I could have tried to push through my issues but the smooth turning was making me nauseous (not a knock on the game, this one and Skyrim are just tough for me). I did push through the snap-turn controls even though those need a lot of work. Half the time it just turned me around 180 degrees because it doesn\u2019t register the move controller flick. I don\u2019t see why they didn\u2019t just make snap turning left and right the X and O buttons like smooth turning.\n\nI also had to restart because the canister that drops when you defeat the last enemy despawned and I couldn\u2019t open the door. I feel like if there\u2019s a glitch like that early on, there\u2019s bound to be more.\n\nOnce I opened the door and got to the end of the opening section, the keyboard was frustrating to use. It would register adjacent keys to the one I was pointing at, it would add random spaces, the delete button would trigger the enter button erasing everything I typed in.

I'll be reviewing this live tonight on my channel if anyone wants to ask questions whilst i'm in game but I figured i'd type up a review message for you all here, if this is too long of a read skip to the summary at the bottom. \n\nFirst of All thank you to Fast Travel games for providing me with a Review Copy of the game, and Also I Apologize if you do not like my Review but I am Maintaining my Objectivity and just giving my honest opinions on this particular game, your Hard work is still very much appreciated.\n\n\n* **Graphics** - Apex Construct is a nice looking game, you notice as soon as you put on your headset that the visuals are nice and clear, the Art style is nice to look at. The image though (pre day one patch) has aliasing on many edges, (I played on a Pro) which I wasn't expecting and the way that the world is put together is a bit rough. Some objects are missing Collision so you just walk right through them one of which was a Wall I was meant to explode with an explosive arrow but didn't need to as i could just walk through it.\n\n\n* **Gameplay** - I found the game play to be OK at best, the first quarter of the game is very dull with very few enemies to shoot at, you spend most of your time standing typing at terminals, either to open doors using codes you find on clipboard notes, or at laptops to learn more about the story and the world. Initially this feels quite cool, but by the 15th time you do it it becomes extremely tedious, as the computer system is DOS based. So for example you want to check the file directory, you need to VR type, DIR then hit Enter. \n\n\nThis will bring up a list of files (there could be 6 of them) To read each one you then need to type. Open &lt;Name of File&gt; some file names are quite long such as Swanstrom or Architect. Combine the long names with accidentally hitting the wrong letter and having to delete and repeat the word it becomes very tedious and boring. Plus each file you open could be a long paragraph of text to read, this pushes your directory off the top of the screen meaning if you can't remember every filename you will need to type dir again to get the directory list.\n\n\nLater on in the game you start getting codes on the laptop screens themselves that you have to remember, Being someone that does not have the best memory, by the time i found the computer terminal the code was meant for after a lot of traversal and enemy fights, i would have forgotten the code and have to back track through the level to find that exact laptop to remember it again. This lead to me taking a screenshot with the shareplay tool, wandering around the level to the correct terminal and hen dropping out to my Screenshot gallery to recall the Number. I have NEVER had to do this in a game before, it's partially my memory in real life but i also believe it to be poor game design as there Should be some way of storing those numbers, or taking an in game screenshot, not a Shareplay one.\n\n\nThe combat is just Ok, the bow feels good, the tracking is great, but the hitboxs on the enemies are very precise, you feel like you need to hit them exactly in the glowing red eye in order to damage them, a leg shot, backside shot or body shot doesn't seem to register as a hit. Later on this becomes a frustrating issue as you need to quickly swap between your electric arrows and regular\/explosive arrows to take down enemies with shields, and it often leaves you feel cheated as you know you hit the enemy, just not in the area the game wanted you to hit them.\n\n\nThe Inventory system is genius though, I love being able to pick up objects from the wold and have them shrink down in to my inventory on my arm so that I can retrieve them later, this was my favourite part of the game and was very useful\/critical to helping me solve the 4 digit code puzzles.\n\n\nThe puzzles in this game 99% of the time amount to finding a 4 Digit Code to open a Door, they even make a joke about it later in the game where you find a note that says something like \"it's crazy how many 4 digit password we need to remember in this place\", there are one or two other puzzles but it's all very simple and most of the time feels like a way of slowing down the pace of the game.\n\n\n* **Story** - Theres not much to write here, the story is serviceable but you will have heard it all before, it's very cliche, Two A.I. named Mother and Father (who incidentally sounds a lot like Ultron from Avengers 2) who oppose each other, Father is the one who leads you through the story but is he good or Evil? who knows, you will find out when you play.\n\n\n* **Sound\/Music** - Music is mostly ominous tones, it is ok and serves the atmosphere, the fight music is the same one single track every time you get to a fight, essentially whenever you hear this music flare up you know enemies are nearby, its kind of tribal i quite like it but by the 100th time it plays you just ignore it other than as an early warning system, it's very bassy though which was nice on my headphones.\n\n\n* **Bugs** - (There is a Day one patch that Might fix these issues but I have no desire to play this game again to check) I encountered Several Extremely Frustrating and game breaking Bugs. Yes game breaking bugs, enemies which would spawn in and not move but be invincible so i couldn't kill them to trigger the next wave or part of the story, with the only solution being to kill myself and do that section all over again, this happened to me more than 5 times in separate locations.\nThe mid level Boss also seemed to stop working every 3rd death, meaning once again i had to kill myself to trigger him to work again.\n\n\nI was able to teleport myself out of the world on several occasions, walk through walls, walk through computer terminals. Quite often you will find a chair placed in front of a laptop and when you walk near the laptop your character will climb up on to the chair which will stop you from being able to type on the laptop. Most of the time i could pick up the chair and throw it away but there was a couple of occasions where that was not possible so i had to leave the laptop alone.\n\n\nI was often getting stuck on bits of the terrain as I walked around having to use my teleporter to get out of them. This happened so frequently I figured that's why we have the ability to teleport in the game, it's not for motion sickness, it's a get out of Jail free card every time you encounter a bug that stops you from walking forward.\n\n\nTrying to type at terminals would keep popping me further away from the terminal as though the collision detection suddenly decided I was too close and would push me away from it. This would lead to frustration whilst typing causing miss hit keys and at times having to stretch to type the keyboard as the game wouldn't let me get in to a comfortable position to type.\n\n\n* **Controls** - Controls work great, they are exactly like skyrim, Left Move to walk in direction the move is facing, X and O on the right move to turn left and right. Square on left move to teleport, triangle on left move to open inventory. Triggers to grab. You walk very slowly and turn very slowly even on the fastest of options, I found myself getting bored walking at a snails pace everywhere so proceeded to teleport like a madman just to traverse the terrain.\n\n\n* **Level Design** - The levels are not bad, but they aren't great and tbh theres only about 4 or 5 of them, the game employs a Metroid Vania style of Gameplay which in my cynical nature is just code for, \"We re-use as much stuff as possible\" you will traverse the same locations, over and over and over and over again, just slightly opening up little extra pockets with a new Higher leveled keycard. It makes playing the game boring because you see the same Area AGAIN but you only get to experience maybe 10% extra.\n\n\n* **Longevity** - Upon finishing this game, I collected a lot of the secrets (little trophys of various models from the game) and you can go back in replay the same missions over again looking for these secrets but I honestly have no desire to play this game again, i'd be to bored. I might bring it back out to show off VR Newbies the pretty graphics, but that's about it.\n\n\n* **Summary** - This game is not the AAA game I think some have hyped it up to be, It's not a bad game, it has a nice Art style, but it reminds me a lot of Arizona Sunshine, Admittedly it's of a slightly higher quality Art Wise than Arizona but I'd put it in the same category, a kind of Mid budget title that is aiming high but doesn't quite have the ability\/money to reach it's lofty ideals. \n\n\nHowever I had more fun blasting Zombies in Arizona than fighting the little Robots in This game. If i want to shoot Robots with a bow and Arrow I'd be better off playing Raw Data to be honest, but that could be because i'm more of an action junkie, Long drawn out game play experiences where nothing happens for 50% of my playtime is not my cup of tea. I like to play games to be entertained and have fun and this game made me feel like it was a Chore to just get to the end, with a very underwhelming ending which made me question did i just finish this game? (you'll know when you get there).\n\n\nThis is possibly the most scathing review I've ever done (DWVR comes close) but I think it's because I was really Willing this game to succeed, because i've seen SO many of you guys on here looking forward to it that i feel let down for everyone as well as myself, I wasn't Hyped highly for the game but i guess i expected more, something better, something more refined, something that was greater than the games that came out in Year one, but it's pretty much a prettier more boring version of Arizona sunshine and I feel like I need to tell the truth. \n\n\nWell at least my Version of the truth as how I see it, If your gaming tastes are similar to mine i'm sure you'll feel the same but i can guarantee there will be plenty of people on here who think this is the best game ever, I'm unfortunately not one of them no matter how much I wish i was.\n\n\nI hope you found this Review Helpful and objective. I'll be reviewing it live in Video form Later as I said earlier but This Written Review is basically how i feel. \n\n\nI'm Kind of Gutted to be honest.\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.\nThe_Preacher \n\n\n\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Apex Construct Written Review - Full Game completed - By The_Preacher","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7ywhiw\/apex_construct_written_review_full_game_completed\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"madpropz","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1519089016,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":1519089465.0,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"7yryem","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"no_follow":false,"num_comments":26,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7yryem\/apex_construct_is_another_unpolished_game\/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1520566519,"score":9,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I swear idk what it is with devs releasing unfinished games but it seems to be a new trend on PSVR.\nFirst of all, the controls in the game feel clunky as hell \n(playing with Moves).\nThe smooth turning even with the slider set to fast is slow as hell, and the free locomotion movement speed even when running is slow, i don\u2019t even wanna talk about walking. \nFunny thing is, i went back to the menu to change smooth turning back to incremental turning and now the rotation doesn\u2019t even work, so i guess for this playthrough i\u2019m stuck with smooth turning. To me the biggest problem with turning is that there is not an extra option to turn where you look which would go very well with the smooth turning, just take cues from Solus Project control scheme. This is an issue because you often don\u2019t feel centered at all.\nWhen i come close to any object it just teleports me a few inches away from it, not letting me get too close which is a terrible design choice (can\u2019t even look through windows properly), why not just make the screen black when my head enters the object or something? \nSome objects you can just run through for no apparent reason, for example the computer stations where you type in stuff don\u2019t have any collision on them whatsoever. I found a document with a password to use on the computer and i placed the document next to it, this made a new problem where every time i went to press a keyboard button my hand would think i wanna pick up the document which was at least a foot away from my hand.\nSome objects animate fluidly while others look janky as hell like they are running at 15fps or worse, and materials also glitch in and out.\nInsects don\u2019t even touch the surface that they walk on while walking, they just kinda hover a few inches over it.\nSounds also sometimes cutoff instantly without any proper falloff, like in the lobby area, you can hear a waterfall running loudly and as soon as you enter a room it stops instantly lol...i also had a problem with the sink in the toilet because it didn\u2019t want to turn itself off and it was so loud i could hear it 50ft away.\nPlaying on a Pro i must say i also expected less jaggies considering the art style and how much better some other games look, and i also noticed dropped frames\/tearing in some areas.\nIt is also really bad that you can\u2019t change the options at any time, you can only do it in the menu.\nI could go on about the issues forever, but my point is that this needs to stop, release your games when they feel polished. All these issues have stopped being a thing in flat games for years now, and when they happen in VR they are so much more jarring and prominent because it is supposed to be much more immersive as a medium, so all these little mistakes are very noticeable.\n","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Apex Construct is another unpolished game.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7yryem\/apex_construct_is_another_unpolished_game\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"i_dont_like_reddit_6","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1515682539,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":1515682898.0,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"7polpf","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"num_comments":77,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7polpf\/windows_mixed_reality_review_from_a_day_1_psvr\/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1518522616,"score":45,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"Hi all! Like many of you I've been waiting for the VR revolution since the PowerGlove. I got PSVR when it came out, have contributed to our community's ridiculous attach rates, and have absolutely loved the experience. There's no \"but\" here. I love PSVR. \n\nRecently I bought a new PC - Surface Book 2 - and figured while I'm spending obscene amounts of money why not spend more and bought a Samsung Odyssey HMD Windows Mixed Reality (WMR from now on) headset. After spending a few days with it I wanted to pass my thoughts on here because this sub is always enthusiastic and positive about VR as a whole and other platforms and I figured people would be interested.\n\nTL;DR - WMR is awesome, deserves more attention, and if you have 300-500 bucks to drop on something cool and VR related this year I highly recommend it.\n\nFirst, I want to talk about the hardware. There's a bunch of different headsets available with varying FOV, resolution, weight, etc. I went with the Samsung after trying a bunch of them and doing a little research. The Samsung's specs are pretty crazy for current gen VR - 110 degree FOV, AMOLED screens, built in headphones, 1440x1600 per eye resolution, etc. Specs are specs, but all of this really comes together when you try it. Coming from PSVR - which I've always thought looked awesome - it is amazing. The colors are super bright and vibrant, the integrated sound is super convenient, and the image is much clearer and crisper. Overall its a major step up visually. \n\nThe tracking is also really great. It has inside out tracking, so the headset \"sees\" the controllers. Compared to PSVR I've found it to be much more accurate and reliable. Its also has room scale built in without external sensors - when you first start up WMR it asks you if your sitting or standing. If you are standing then you hold the helmet at waist level and walk a path around your play area. WMR sets this as your play area and you see barriers while in VR and get warned if you are getting close to stuff. It is very, very cool. I also want to mention the controllers - they are amazing. I really hope Sony makes controllers like these for PSVR. They have thumbsticks, a touchpad that can act like buttons or a dpad, a trigger, a grip button, and then windows and menu buttons. They work excellent with perfect tracking and WMR helpfully keeps a 1:1 model of your controllers in the environment so you can see the buttons while you are getting acclimated to the layout. Overall, a really great setup.\n\nOverall the hardware is exactly what I'd like to see in PSVR 2. The inside out tracking, excellent controllers, and better visuals are all truly excellent. That said I will give the PSVR the advantage in comfort and adjustments. Getting the PSVR headset on, in the right positing, and comfortable is easier than the HMD. I've always loved that the PSVR has that elastic mechanism for pulling the \"crown\" open - the HMD only has a dial for mechanical adjustment. I also like that in the PSVR you can kind of tilt your head up and then look down to see outside VR - with the HMD when your in, your in. There's almost no way to see outside without remove it. And, unlike many of the other WMR headsets, you can't tilt the eyepiece up on a hinge. Still, its an amazing piece of kit that every PSVR fan should try.\n\nNow, the software. The WMR environment is very cool. After going through a brief tutorial you are put into your house. At first I didn't quite get what this house was; I thought it was some kind of \"VR Experience.\" The house is actually your PC's interface in VR. You can arrange apps all throughout the house, however you like. There are 2 types of apps in WMR - panels and immersive apps. I don't know if those are what they are actually called, but the names make sense to me. Panels are almost any modern Windows Store app. You can open a panel app and it creates a panel in 3D space with the app's content in it. You can then place this app panel anywhere you want in the house. So, you could have Facebook on a wall, and Edge floating near the back door, or whatever. You can interact with these apps just like you would with a mouse, combined with a virtual keyboard if you need it and voice control and dictation. These are very cool and it seems like most Windows Store apps just work in VR. Some panel apps also have special 3D VR content - for example, the Holograms app can create instances of 3D models in your VR space. So, 2D apps can spawn 3D objects. Some 2D apps also have 3D effects in their interface like depth, or 3D objects in the app (like Paint.) Then there's immersive apps; these are like what we are used to on PSVR - games, experiences, and 3D video and what not. The interface for these is interesting because instead of launching them from a menu or something you put these 3D models in the house wherever you want that represent the 3D app, and then you click on the model to launch it. So, for example, you can place a Minecraft block in your house, and when you click it Minecraft launches in VR. It is a really cool interface, and something I'd love to see on PSVR. \n\nThe interface I described above took me a little while to get the hang of. At first I wasn't sure what to \"do\" in the VR house interface. But after a while I realized that I should just \"do\" whatever I'd \"do\" with my PC. So I created a space with my desktop in a big panel, and facebook and reddit apps off to the side, etc. After a little while it sort of clicked that WMR wasn't like a separate environment or experience - it was my PC, but in VR. Once that clicked it was very exciting.\n\nThis is already getting long, so I will mention some other stuff quickly. Everything runs really smoothly and quite well. My Surface Book 2 has a 1060 with 6GB of video RAM, and i7, and 16GB RAM; that's considered on the mid-to-low end for PC VR, but WMR is tuned for that sort of range of PC. Using apps and games form the Windows Store everything runs perfectly and without a hitch, and coming from PSVR everything is a step up visually. I haven't used Oculus or VIVE or a high end VR rig, so I don't have a point of comparison for those. I thought everything looked and ran perfectly. You can also use Steam VR, which is very, very cool because it gives you access to a ton of VR content through steam. However, WMR support for Steam is still in beta and was a bit confusing to get set up. You have to install a \"WMR for SteamVR\" app in Steam before you can launch SteamVR, or it wont detect your headset. However, once I figured that out I got it working just fine. SteamVR's interface feels a bit clunky compared to WMR, so it took a little getting used to, but it works well. I'm going to download some games and stuff today - I haven't tried any yet. However, the tutorial worked fine, as did YouTube for SteamVR, and the interface itself. It does need to be polished though - switching between the SteamVR interface back to the WMR interface was a little disorienting at first, but I quickly got used to it.\n\nAnyway, that's it. If anyone has any questions or anything they'd like me to try I'd be happy to help out. Overall I think WMR is very compelling and deserves more attention than its getting. If you are a PSVR owner who's looking to get a PC headset I'd definitely recommend you keep WMR in the list and give it a shot. Not only does it do gaming, and you have access to SteamVR, but you get to use your PC in VR, which really feels like the future. I am definitely happy with mine, and would happily recommend it to others.\n","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Windows Mixed Reality review from a day 1 PSVR owner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7polpf\/windows_mixed_reality_review_from_a_day_1_psvr\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"YogX","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1515146347,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"7oa9xf","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"num_comments":26,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7oa9xf\/bad_recroom_experience\/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1518497506,"score":0,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I loaded RecRoom for the first time yesterday. I was excited because I heard so many good things about it (although it didn't seem like the game for me).\nThe \"onboarding\" experience is quite fun (even registering with my own email - typing on a huge keyboard with my hand is fun!) and I really enjoyed following the initial \"task list\".\nPaddleball is not that great, but it was a really good first experience. Disc Gold and Quests were much more enjoyable for me.\nEven though I did enjoy my time I'm not sure I'll go back because of two things:\n1. It seems like most of the gamers are small kids (at least by their voice) who just leave the mic open and I can hear the rest of their family\/humming to themselves\n2. And this is probably \"THE\" reason I won't be coming back. While playing 3D Charades (which wasn't fun at all... but I played a couple of games anyway because it was on the checklist) one of the players had the name HitlerBabe. I ignored it at first but during the two games, people just thought it was funny to say \"Hail Hitler\" over and over until at one point everybody was chanting it. Not in a \"war\" like way, but in a \"fun\" kind of way. Which maybe even freaked me out a bit more.

There's been so much talk about the control system in Doom and I finally got to try it out last night. After initially fumbling around with the moves in the tutorial and feeling like I needed a button to turn, I tried the pad. This seemed like the way to play it, smooth motion with the sticks, turning, it all felt good, it all felt right, except those guns sticking out and having to aim with my face, oh and pressing a button to launch a grenade instead of throwing it.\n\nOnce in the game I decided to switch back to moves, after all, this is how the developers designed it to be played, right?. After half an hour of getting used to it all I was having an absolute blast. I never thought I'd say this but zipping around with teleportation and dashing was exhilarating and exciting,  and what's more I could examine the weapons, and aim with my hands, and actually throw grenades instead of pushing a button. Besides being in the game, these are the things that make being in VR cool, and for me it outweighs smooth locomotion.\n\nIt's like Morpheus said, you have to free your mind. Console players are used to playing games with a pad and sticks and when we try another method it feels awkward and clunky and weird... of course it does... so did a joypad when you first picked one up, so did the keyboard and mouse when you first tried a PC game: wtf? four keys to move, 2 for lean, F to pick things up, R for reload, TAB for map, G for grenade... I'll never remember all this shit! But eventually you do.\n\nThis has been a revelation to me. Now I'm not saying that smooth locomotion should be abandoned and we should all use teleportation for every game (I wouldn't want to play Skyrim that way) but for Doom it works, if you have the patience to get used to it. You don't need to be able to turn with a button, you twist your body, you reach across yourself, you teleport away from danger then 180 degree flip. It's a different way of playing and it's very cool, if you just give yourself time to adjust to it.\n\nSo try it, don't try it, makes no difference to me, but you might be missing out on something different if you've given up because you want to play it like you do with a pad.\n\nTLDR: The developers designed Doom to play with teleporting and the moves. Try playing it the way they intended instead of stubbernly insisting that it must have click turning and smooth locomotion.\n\nEdit: I started a game with the pad (I have one for each controller now) and it was fun once you ignored the sticky out hands and adapted to aiming with your head. I did the first level on Ultra Violence first try. Then I went back to my moves save and replayed the same level at the same difficulty and boy was it so much harder! But I love the challenge! It's going to be fun with each control method.","spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"PSVR","subreddit_id":"t5_3102i","subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Doom: all I'm saying is give moves a chance.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/7h24pd\/doom_all_im_saying_is_give_moves_a_chance\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads"},{"archived":false,"author":"joshtheboss457","author_flair_css_class":null,"author_flair_text":null,"brand_safe":true,"contest_mode":false,"created_utc":1508560802,"distinguished":null,"domain":"self.PSVR","edited":false,"gilded":0,"hidden":false,"hide_score":false,"id":"77rgrn","is_crosspostable":false,"is_reddit_media_domain":false,"is_self":true,"is_video":false,"link_flair_css_class":null,"link_flair_text":null,"locked":false,"media":null,"media_embed":{},"num_comments":3,"num_crossposts":0,"over_18":false,"parent_whitelist_status":"all_ads","permalink":"\/r\/PSVR\/comments\/77rgrn\/questions\/","pinned":false,"retrieved_on":1510460898,"score":1,"secure_media":null,"secure_media_embed":{},"selftext":"I have both a pc and ps4 on the same desk (well underneath) so with the charging + the mouse + the keyboard stuff gets kind of tangled and messy.

I feel spaced out doing this.\n- Driving my real car is totally odd.  After driveclub my brain is having trouble reconciling that with reality to the point where my vision is having difficulty looking at one thing as everything is 'drifting' past my eyes (I've stopped driving for now)\n- I'm dreaming about VR, not the games, but the strange floaty feeling and everything in the world appears low res...\n\nI thought when I got up this morning I'd be fine but its been about 20 hours since my last use of the headset and I hope this stops soon.  I've read up on it and will try all the preventative measures (a fan\/tablets\/adjusting brightness etc.) but wow man.... I'm in a cafe right now typing this and man I feel weird.

Basically, it lost tracking when I brake hard, turning on tight corner, or just crash with other cars\/wall. Initially, I thought this was DriveclubVR specific bug (or PSVR driver bug when used on DriveclubVR) because this wont happen on other games. \n\nI search deep on internet but found nothing. It looks like no one ever experienced this issue before. I also post it on reddit a while ago and still no clue.\n\nBut then, few hours after I post this on reddit (and after weeks of scientifically done self troubleshooting with no luck) suddenly I got an eureka moment. Why don't I check WHEEL VIBRATION FORCE FEEDBACK?\n\nFYI I play DriveclubVR with logitech G29 steering wheel. To increase immersion, I cranked up force feedback and vibration up to max setting. When I brake hard, do a tight turn, or hitting other car, the steering wheel shakes violently. Because my G29 is mounted on something non rigid (it was 15 years old computer desk with sliding keyboard rest, where my G29 is clamped there), the rumble shake everything from TV (with PS4 camera on it) to my head (where PSVR is seated). This violent vibration somehow messed up PS Camera \/ PSVR tracking to the point where it become lost track, froze and shut down all of its LED tracking light, and turning it on again after about 3 second of dizzying effect (aka teleporting field of view and stopping all of the head tracking input)\n\nI don't know yet which equipment exactly the vibration is effecting. Whether PS Camera or PSVR itself. Lets see. But anyway, this effect is very reproducible by using DriveclubVR setting menu where we can manually vibrate G29 by selecting vibration setup. When I manually vibrate G29 from this setup, the menu suddenly froze, just like I expect.  So, It was scientifically confirmed that the vibration is the main culprit. This also answer why this bug only appear when I play DriveclubVR. Because I don't use G29 while playing job simulator\n\nMy temporal solution for now is lowering the vibration setting until the problem is vanished. Event though this was not my preferred solution because for me reducing force feedback means reducing immersion, but I can live with it. at least until i bought new desk to mount my setup rigidly. But it wont happen soon because I still love my 15 years old computer desk\n\nTLDR: I've found that G29 force feedback vibration messed up PS Camera \/ PSVR tracking while playing DriveclubVR\n\nEDIT: I've also confirmed that the froze is due to the vibration ON PS CAMERA, not PSVR. It looks like that when PS Camera vibrate, the image it tooks become flicker and eventually lost track. Because PS4 developer have an assumption that PS Camera is mounted fix (and PSVR is the moving), they think that the cause of flickering image is not in PS Camera, but due to PSVR. That's why PS4 sent a signal to it to restart the LEDs hence the LEDs shutdown for 3 second before lighting up again.

Is there like a common trend or tip people know about to have their camera setup properly? For example, to get VR worlds to work properly, I had to take the camera mounted on top of my PC monitor which I game on, and lower it down on my desk where my keyboard lays. Then I had to sit on my floor to get my head recognized in the frame and proceed forward. Really annoying and completely took the immersion out of it for me. But then, I go to play Sportsbar VR, and I get to the part where I have to match my head with the circle and I could not for the life of me get it in there. Eventually I had to take the camera and mount it on my pc monitor again, walk back as far as I could, and literally stand with my back against the wall. I couldn't play sitting down at all because once again, the camera wouldn't be positioned exactly where the game wanted it\/my head to be. Sorry if I sound like I'm whining but the shit was getting so infuriating I turned it off. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, I returned to sportsbar a little bit later to try again and said fuck it, I'll play the damn game standing up back against the wall. When I got in there, I felt really short compared to the AI people standing around and also, all the objects in the bar, especially the beer bottles seemed way bigger than they're supposed to be in real life. Is there a way to fix that? I've read before that a user had the same problem with object size in RE7. So if anyone knows how to fix the height issue and this object sizing thing too that would be really awesome. \n\nI have a really love hate relationship with this thing so far. It's a great piece of technology and I would love to really get into, but the setup is a bitch, especially positioning the camera properly.

So with that in mind...\n\nFirst of all, this game doesn't *need* VR, so those expecting something amazing in that respect should lower their expectations. However, it uses the physical nature of the VR headset to its benefit - i.e. the person viewing the bomb is put in a room with a bomb and, due to the enclosed screen, are cut off from seeing the outside world and the people reading the manual are therefore unable to see the \"bomb room\" - so this is how VR really benefits this game. Sure, it's cool to be able to move your head around and see things quickly, but you can play this game on a normal screen with a mouse and keyboard. \n\nLast night I played the game with my wife, her sister and my mate. My wife isn't into gaming - she knows I love my playstation, and she thinks the idea of VR is interesting, but it's just not something she's into. Her sister has never touched a gaming console in her life. \n\nMy wife is STILL going on about how much fun she had playing last night! First she started off just reading the manual and helping me defuse the bomb with the others, but then she wanted to have a go with the headset to do \"just one bomb and then I'm going to sleep\"... turned into about 10 bombs and a couple of hours. \n\nIt's a really, really fun game for 3+ people, and especially great for getting non-gaming people into playing. She's already badgering me about when we can play next. \n\nEdit 2: We had printed manuals, which I think is a lot better than everyone trying to read from the TV.
