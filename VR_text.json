Swapping between the view in the headset and the view on my 4K monitor and it\\u2019s seriously impressive how close they look to each other.\n\nNormally I game in 4K and sit about a foot and a half away to get maximum detail and obviously the further away you sit from a display you begin to lose those details which is why a lot of people can\\u2019t see the difference between 1080p and 1440p and 4K. Obviously when you sit very closely to your display you can see the differences quite clearly. In this instance I am sitting about 5 feet away from the display here at the moment and as I said swapping between the view inside the quest 3 and view on my monitor there is not much difference at 1440p. Playing like this then on the Quest 3 means it\\u2019s something you can do anywhere if you have a good wireless connection. That means you\\u2019re not tied to your desk and don\\u2019t feel like you\\u2019re compromising on the visual quality.\n\nI am not new to this as I've been doing big screen 2D gaming in VR ever since I got into VR years ago. My last headset the HP Reverb G2 had one of the highest clarities of all the headsets at the time. But the problem with the G2 was the tiny, sweet-spot which meant that when playing in a static position looking at the entire screen as you would do in front of a monitor playing a game, the only bits of clarity were in the very centre, so you\\u2019d have to keep moving your head around the screen to sort of maintain that clarity. That\\u2019s a really unnatural way you would be sitting there playing a game. You don\\u2019t normally sit moving your head looking around the screen, you just keep your head static and look forwards. What I am finding now then with the Quest 3 and its wonderful pancake lenses and the fact that the resolution bump is high enough now, that is a fantastic way to be playing games without being tied to your desk as I said it\\u2019s seriously impressive.\n\nI recently [did a preview](https:\\/\\/cramgaming.com\\/xbox-game-pass-app-for-quest-vr-is-totally-pointless-but-has-so-much-potential-63015\\/) of the new Xbox game pass cloud streaming app for Quest headsets, unfortunately that is tied to streaming an Xbox console either Xbox One or Xbox Series S maybe an X in some cases and that quality is not particularly great compared to streaming from your local PC. But this is the first time I've tried doing 2D gaming on a large screen in VR with high pc settings on the Quest 3. Let\\u2019s say you have a 1080p monitor but your PC can push something higher to maybe 1440p, effectively the Quest 3 is acting as your monitor and would give you a better display than the 1080p monitor you might have. Well, that\\u2019s pretty good stuff right there, isn\\u2019t it?\n\nI know a lot of people are going to suggest, a VR headset is really meant for the VR experience and shouldn\\u2019t cater to desktop 2D flat-screen pancake gaming whatever you want to call it. They\\u2019re not the same and of course I partially agree, but I have been playing the Luke Ross cyberpunk 2077 mod for quite some time in VR and whilst it\\u2019s really cool, it\\u2019s lacking details, has lots of artefacts, lots of ghosting and you\\u2019ve got to spend time messing around with it to get it looking good. Having tried playing the same game with the high settings and with ray\\/path tracing enabled (you can\\u2019t turn ray tracing on using the Real VR mod because even an RTX 4090 can\\u2019t handle that at decent resolution) it\\u2019s pretty awesome. Seeing all the bells-and-whistles on in 2D via the quest 3 is pretty amazing stuff and I am just sort of gushing about it now. I am going to try some other games to see how they fare as well. It just means that I can sit and game at really high settings without being at the desk. I'm going to sit in the garden (well not right now because it\\u2019s pretty cold), but you know I could sit in the garden, and have some really high quality gaming experiences without having to move the workhorse PC anywhere. I think that in itself is pretty amazing stuff and it\\u2019s not something that VR headsets have been able to really accomplish in the past (with this sort of fidelity) until now especially with the fact that the Quest 3 is a standalone device that can handle that. I am also wondering why this isn\\u2019t being pushed more as a feature from META and even SONY with its PSVR 2?\n\nIt\\u2019s all well and good having the Xbox game pass cloud streaming app as a way to play 2D games on your headset, but that as I said wasn\\u2019t necessarily a high-quality experience showing the best of what the headset can accomplish. I'm quite intrigued to know where this is going to go because it\\u2019s basically portable gaming much like you have a handheld device such as Steam deck or whatever strapped to your head rather than in your hand and you\\u2019re getting a high-quality experience that\\u2019s very portable within the home, office etc.\n\nFor the record, I would just like to add, that this entire post was constructed using the microphone speech-to-text option in Virtual Desktop. Reason why I am mentioning this is because it fits the whole portable narrative in not having to have your PC with you i.e keyboard\\/monitor to be able to work and do stuff that you would normally do at your desk. I think the speech-to-text has improved massively to be able to do this. Interesting times with the arrival of the Quest 3\\/PSVR 2 for VR and flatscreen gaming.",

            "selftext": "So I was able to experience PSVR 2 the other day, and I think that it is a solid buy for console gamers.   \nTo elaborate the context, I'm not a console gamer, I never owned a single XBox or a PlayStation.\n\nBut I have like 975 hours in SteamVR, I played various native and non-native (modded) VR stuff on my PC with the Valve Index, mostly including simulators and fps games. And yes, while the Valve Index is a 2019 hardware and the PSVR 2 is a 2022 stuff, the difference was visible for the later after the first 5 minutes.\n\nA few things I noticed on PSVR 2:\n\n\\-  The engineers at Sony really pushed the same concept for it as they did for the base consoles. Which is you buy it, plug it in, scan the room around you (just like how Quest 3 works), and then boom, you are in the PlayStation menu and you can jump right in.\n\n\\- The second immediate thing I noticed, that the visual fidelity is surprisingly good. I mean it's not as extremely good as if you would crank up SteamVR's resolution to 3600x2400, but it is really feel like it's the golden middle. This comes in pair with the impression of how surprisingly good the framerate is. I mean I expected much worse by somewhat knowing the PlayStation 5's hardware capabilities. In Layman's terms I had a feeling that to achieve the same 8 ms speed on SteamVR, I would need a beefy hardware for the given game, like a 3090 or a 4080. So I was really surprised on how good the visual clarity is and how good the framerate is.\n\n\\- I know this one is kinda like an axiom for console users, but I was very pleasant on how you don't need to tweak any setting in order to have the best possible visual fidelity and framerate pair for the given application. Every single one I tried (horizon, re: village, re:4 remake) performed very well.\n\n\\- The headset's mass is lighter compared to the Index: while the cable attached is still making limitations on how you can use it, the HMD's phisical presence felt much less obnoxious for longer sessions. \n\nThe cons I noticed:\n\n\\- That thin-rubber layer which sits directly on the nose can be very annoying sometimes\n\n\\- The cable thing obviously is for many other headsets.\n\n\\- The amount of available PSVR 2 titles in the PlayStation store is comparable to SteamVR except there is like less available titles, and here you can't really play with mods to run a given title in VR. My best hope for the common good is that Sony and other publishers will make VR versions of big titles. I can see this coming.\n\nTo summarize all of these, I think for the value and the price, this is a very solid and nice headset, and it is worth buying for those who consider entering into  the VR space. But only buy it when you are entirely sure that you can adapt to motion sickness. So for the price of this PS5-PSVR2-4kTV combo, you will get a good experience back compared to the many hours you need to spend on PCVR in order to get a reliable clarity-framerate combo with a relatively beefy PC.\n\n9\\/10 recommended.",

You can get through this whole process in under 30 minutes but please read this before you start.\n\nStep 0 - Repeat, please read the steps before you do anything as you need streamVr compatible dongles or an Index, and you need this https:\\/\\/github.com\\/pushrax\\/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator installed. \n\nStep 1 - is to get Oculus link to work with your PC and SteamVR.   Oculus will complain it is not the default for OpenXR but ignore that unless you don't want to use SteamVR and want to train wreck this process.\n\nStep 2 - You need two Index Base station's and some way to talk to your base stations if you want to use the knuckle controllers.   One way that isn't exactly reliable is if you have an Index, unplug the Display port, but leave the USB and power plugged in.  SteamVR can still use the Index HMD to talk to the light houses but perhaps it is just better to get two (yes 2, one for each lighthouse\\/station) of these https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/dp\\/B0B95LRH7Z?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details \n\nStep 3 - This is the tool you want to allow pairing Index knuckle controllers with Quest 3 https:\\/\\/github.com\\/pushrax\\/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator   Make sure it is installed.\n\nStep 4.1 - With Oculus link running SteamVR, go to the desktop SteamVR widget, go to the menu, select Devices, and then choose to pair a device.   When it asks what you want to pair, select the Knuckle controller picture.  Turn the RIGHT Knuckle controller on, follow the instructions, and when it says it is paired, select to pair another device.  Repeat for the left.   IF things are working correctly, the Steam VR desktop widget will show the knuckle controller icons next to the Oculus controller and HMD symbols.\n\nStep 4.2 - This is somewhat janky but you may only have to repeat this step 1x a week or even 1x a month.   You only need the Right Oculus controller and Right Index controller.   Find the OpenVR Space Calibrator on your windows bar, click it and it should open a bare bones text interface.   Look around for and click a command like \"Copy chaperone bounds\".   Next there are two list boxes, on the left is the Quest 3 equipment and one or two Oculus controllers.  Click on the one with the word \"RIGHT\" then on the other box, the right list box, click the item with the words Knuckle and \"Right\"\n\nStep 4.3 - This is the super janky part.   Select the \"Very slow\" calibration radio button near the bottom of the Space Calibrator.   With your right hand, strap on the Index controller, then cradle the right Quest 3 controller in your fingers so the two controllers are being held in your right hand.   Using your left hand, click the \"calibrate\" button in the Space calibrator window.    As soon as the window changes and the calibration progress bar appears, make sure you have the Quest 3 on your head and running.   Proceed to move your right hand in vertical figure 8's, twist your wrist left and right, turn the two controllers side to side, and if you can manage it even upside down.  Go as crazy as you can, the more data\\/movement, the better the calibration.   While this is happening, you can peek at the calibration window and when its done, you can set the Quest 3 controller down.   You should be done, strap on the left Knuckle controller and it should be positioned correctly in your left hand.\n\nStep 5 - You can fine tune the Knuckle controller's orientation with the Space Calibrator window OR if it is really off, redo the calibration process again.\n\nOptional step 6 - Half Life Alyx prefers the Knuckle controllers and will ignore the Quest 3 controller(s).   Beat saber and some other games get totally fucking confused.   This is a tedious step but you can take the battery out of the right oculus controller (also the left one if it is on but it shouldn't be on and should be in the box somewhere).\n\n\nI will try and get some screen shots up but it's a little goofy to get good pictures when I am switching back and forth from VR to flat PC.",

If you go into the SteamVR settings, then Steam Link, you can drag the encoded video slider to the right to increase the \"middle\" area, the auto setting is around 1024px but the slider fully to the right is still limited to 1344px.\n\nHowever if you go into the SteamVR file path you can find a settings folder, then modify that setting to increase the limit.\n\n&gt;C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Steam\\\\steamapps\\\\common\\\\SteamVR\\\\drivers\\\u000brlink\\\resources\\\\settings\n\nOpen up the \"settingsschema.vrsettings\" folder and under the \"streamFormatWidth\" setting increase the \"max\" number.

If theres a fix for stuttering or lag or brokeness of meta vr w pc online ive probbably done it all but like say 6 months pasted since i just stoped playing pcvr and i got a new headset thinking mabye the usbc slot on mine was busted and my machine is decently up to date i can run anything i throw at it it cant be that so if i just get a new headset itl work it in fact did not same issue with the latest meta headset so now ik forsure its my software like it has to be some stupid software issue so i look again and i find setting the priority of ovrs server stuff to real time priorty in the task manager made games work and playable kinda and ive been able to load into stuff but im having the wierdist issue they r still hard to play because of a bit of lag it gets bad when anything happens but issnt just not working anymore i can play more simple stuff without it ruining the exsperince too much like hitman 3 vr or half life 2 vr mod but acctual vr games like b&amp;S are acting really wierd what helps others like changing the res to 100 instead of steams automatic 150 makes it stutter way more and increaseing things like the graphic settings ingame for all the games makes preformance and stuttering way smoother but still with some stutters im honestly at a loss for ideas ive tried running it at every setting but anything below 90 hz is so laggy and drops more frames its so backwards to every solution i find online im so confused \n\nalso sorry for wall of text \n\nif you have any suggestions or just have the same issue pls lmk ",

If theres a fix for stuttering or lag or brokeness of meta vr w pc online ive probbably done it all but like say 6 months pasted since i just stoped playing pcvr and i got a new headset thinking mabye the usbc slot on mine was busted and my machine is decently up to date i can run anything i throw at it it cant be that so if i just get a new headset itl work it in fact did not same issue with the latest meta headset so now ik forsure its my software like it has to be some stupid software issue so i look again and i find setting the priority of ovrs server stuff to real time priorty in the task manager made games work and playable kinda and ive been able to load into stuff but im having the wierdist issue they r still hard to play because of a bit of lag it gets bad when anything happens but issnt just not working anymore i can play more simple stuff without it ruining the exsperince too much like hitman 3 vr or half life 2 vr mod but acctual vr games like b&amp;amp;S are acting really wierd what helps others like changing the res to 100 instead of steams automatic 150 makes it stutter way more and increaseing things like the graphic settings ingame for all the games makes preformance and stuttering way smoother but still with some stutters im honestly at a loss for ideas ive tried running it at every setting but anything below 90 hz is so laggy and drops more frames its so backwards to every solution i find online im so confused &lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;also sorry for wall of text &lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;if you have any suggestions or just have the same issue pls lmk &lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In either case, here are my quick thoughts on the 22 games I played from September through October 2023.\n\n*TLDR: My top 5 games to check out from this list are at the bottom and so is some info for a game giveaway.*\n\n## Games Played In September\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Track Craft (Demo)\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/10038131272867316\\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** Hot Wheels inspired racing with an extremely generous demo.\n\n**From the store:** Ready to take a joyride down memory lane? Our mixed reality game for the Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro brings back the childhood thrill of playing with cars with a twist. Craft your own racing tracks, share them with friends, and compete in high-speed races in a fully immersive environment. This demo version contains a demo track pack containing 20 levels, three cars, and a track editor to challenge your creativity.\n\n**My thoughts:** This is a very generous demo of a Hot Wheels style car racing game that has shades of [Stunt Track Builder VR](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4397519526943470\\/), but with its own unique take on it. While I didn\\u2019t find the track building as easy as in Stunt Track Builder VR, it has a campaign with time trials to beat, a variety of vehicles that handle differently, and user created levels that can keep you quite busy for hours. This is a generous free demo and I can\\u2019t wait to see how the full version shakes out. Absolutely give it a go if you like Hot Wheels or racing.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### I Expect you to Die 3: Cog in the Machine\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4676322075753574\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2296380\\/I_Expect_You_To_Die_3_Cog_in_the_Machine\\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick take:** A master-class in escape room games.\n\n**From the store:** Outwit your most cunning adversary to date in the latest installment of this popular, spy-themed puzzle series. Wield new gadgets, visit action-packed locales, and wear custom disguises as you dive back into the world of espionage in this escape room game.\n\n**My thoughts:** This escape room game is a culmination of ideas, talent and creativity from the first two IEYTD games (three if you count [Home Sweet Home](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4751810638214255\\/)) that were all put into this title. The intro alone is worth the price of admission. With a great story, collectibles and reasons to go back to get the best score, or unlock achievements, this puzzle game has legs. This exceptional game continues to deliver smart puzzles and takes the franchise in different directions that I won\\u2019t spoil here. Give this one a go if you want to express your inner James Bond.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Poly Ego\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5860797560692158\\/?utm_source=www.google.com&amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2463490\\/Poly_Ego\\/) $14.99 [Demo](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6667623289970181\\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** Budget Portal - in a good way\n\n**From the store:** So, you've got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism? Fancy getting your digital head messed with in an uncanny world where logic is king and folly is your only solace? Well, dear misfit, step right up to Poly Ego. In the infinite space, you become an unsuspecting lab rat - well, lab robot, to be more precise. Thrust into a reality that teeters between \"oh, that's clever\" and \"why the hell am I doing this?\", you must navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles, all while a robot named Bluepy keeps you company - and sometimes drives you mad.\n\n**My thoughts:** I started off by playing the demo of this clearly Portal inspired game. I\\u2019m not going to lie, the movement is not terribly intuitive and frankly tough to get used to. With a bit more polish, it could be a solid Portal-style game. While the game clearly wears its inspiration on its sleeve, it does lack the fine tuning that many games have. That being said, I found myself playing through the entire demo, slowly learning the controls and made my way to the end. I thought \\u201cwell, with some more polish, I wonder how a full game might look.\\u201d I then noticed they had a full game out. I'm 30 out of 40 levels in and am having quite a good time despite all my concerns. I've ran into game breaking bug, and the dev is quick to fix them. There are problems with this game, but the smart puzzles keep pulling me back. If you're a Portal fan, give the demo a try for sure.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Trivia Crack VR\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6709385002410356\\/) $9.99\n\n**My quick take:** There\\u2019s a lot of potential in this trivia game, but give it some time to develop.\n\n**From the store:** This is a place full of fun and curiosity, where you can share your knowledge with others and prove that you are worthy of becoming the future director of the park. You'll be able to compete in trivia matches and mini-games with people from all around the world or play on your own and beat your own high scores.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game feels like it's in early access, and I\\u2019d only recommend playing with friends currently. There is clearly a lot of work left to do in this game as it\\u2019s a bare bones 5-player trivia game with wildly inconsistent questions ranging from easy (What is Sponge Bob\\u2019s favorite food?) to very specific (What is the smallest island in the Galapagos?). I really think this will be a winner once they flesh out avatars, question difficulty and offer more modes and settings. Let this cook for a couple of months unless you\\u2019re dying for some VR trivia. I had a chance to chat with the developers and they really want to make a go of this on the main store, so they are committed to improvements. and it will stay on my Quest as a warmup game with friends.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Call of the Sea VR\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5174697242548672\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/agecheck\\/app\\/1042490\\/) $19.99\n\n**My quick take:** The captivating story pulls you through this solid puzzle adventure.\n\n**From the store:** Call of the Sea VR is an otherworldly tale of mystery and love, set in the 1930s South Pacific. You\\u2019ll explore a lush island paradise, solve puzzles and unlock secrets in refreshing new ways with Meta Quest. Go on the hunt for your husband\\u2019s missing expedition as Norah Everhart, fully voice-acted by Cissy Jones (Firewatch, The Walking Dead: Season 1), and take in the beautiful sights of a cryptic land, uncovering occult mysteries and venturing through forgotten ruins.\n\n**My thoughts:** This puzzle adventure game kept me intrigued and scratching my head a few times. Not terribly difficult, and not technically impressive, I did find the story very unique and the environments varied. I didn\\u2019t run into any glitches - a key in puzzle games, but I did find the hint system to be a bit too generous at times. If you haven\\u2019t had your fill of puzzle games, I\\u2019d suggest this one for the story and quality voice acting. At roughly 5-7 hours of gameplay, it\\u2019s one you can sink your teeth into.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### FTD: Find the Difference\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6055957821167625\\/) Free\n\n**My quick take:** A bit too clunky despite a lot of content.\n\n**From the store:** Welcome to an enchanting world where your keen observation skills and VR technology intertwine to create a captivating gaming experience. Prepare yourself for an exciting journey through 18 distinct room types, ranging from a delightful bakery to a thrilling arcade and a warm living room. Your mission in this immersive VR game is to detect the differences between two versions of each room, using your visual acuity, memory, and problem-solving abilities.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game was $15 and then it went free. While you could do worse on the app store, I just didn\\u2019t find the experience polished enough to keep playing. There are a lot of levels here to keep you busy finding the difference between environments, and with different difficulty levels if this one speaks to you, you\\u2019ll get some good game time out of it. For me though, it just didn\\u2019t click and I\\u2019d only recommend it for those fans of the genre.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Mini Golf Aeons\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/en-gb\\/experiences\\/4881013271998328\\/) Free w\\/full game IAP \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2335950\\/Mini_Golf_Aeons__Full_Game\\/) $11.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** The third best mini golf game I\\u2019ve played on Quest\n\n**From the store:** Get ready for the ultimate VR mini golf adventure with Mini Golf Aeons! Explore four distinct and exciting worlds, including a desert landscape, an ocean view, a prehistoric jungle, and a frozen Antarctic wonderland. Each world features beautifully designed and challenging courses that are based on real-life greens, ensuring a truly immersive and authentic experience.\n\n**My thoughts:** I\\u2019ve played a bunch of mini golf games on the Quest, and this is the third best I\\u2019ve played. It will soon be the second when Golf+ removes their mini golf game. While this isn\\u2019t going to replace Walkabout Mini Golf, it\\u2019s doing it's own thing and going for a more realistic environment than WMG. A bit clunky and slow (you have to wait a few seconds to putt until you hear a bell), I didn\\u2019t get into a good flow after the first course (9 holes). The putting did feel pretty solid though. It was quite close to feeling like real life - with a few tweaks still needed in my opinion. The demo didn\\u2019t compel me to buy the full game, but I\\u2019d certainly keep an eye out because it really is close to being very a very solid game.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Yupitergrad 2: The Lost Station\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4446075785447064\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1969000\\/Yupitergrad_2_The_Lost_Station\\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A Metroidvania style game that loses steam halfway in.\n\n**From the store:** Epic action-adventure is back. Yupitergrad 2 raises the stakes. Check out the refined movement and combat system, evade obstacles, and see what surprises the new space journey will bring. Taste new challenges, use new items &amp; discover the secret of the abandoned base. It's a mix of arcade, parkour, and puzzles, Metroidvania style. It's an experience that has never been deeply explored in VR before.\n\n**My thoughts:** I was really excited to play this sequel. I quite enjoyed the first game. The swinging gameplay and physics were spot on, and more of the same sounded good - with the added benefit of a Metroidvania style game. While the core gameplay was still solid, much to my disappointment, the upgrades and game itself quickly lost my interest. Halfway through, the constant back and forth of exacting platforming grew to be quite the chore. With most Metroidvania games, you open up a new secret path to avoid a lot of backtracking, but that is not the case with this game, you're stuck taking the long road back again, and again. While I did finish it, and the story was fun, the game didn\\u2019t have the same pizazz as the first. Honestly, I\\u2019d skip this one, and if you haven\\u2019t played either, absolutely go with the first as it has a lot more content to keep you busy.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### EarthQuest\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6320120764784270\\/) $4.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** An app that tries hard to be [Google Earth](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/348250\\/Google_Earth_VR\\/) on Quest\n\n**From the store:** Street View Integration: I'm thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level. Single Player Mode: I've implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience. It's optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).\n\n**My thoughts:** Considering the limitations of the Quest and all the data that Google Earth is calling for, this is an impressive app. It\\u2019s certainly not as good as Google Earth on Steam proper, but if you don\\u2019t have access to that, this is the second best option. While a bit clunky to navigate, slow to load at times, and not as graphically impressive, EarthQuest is something fun to experiment and play with. If this is something that interests you even mildly, you could do worse for $4.99. Give it a try, but know that there are some real limitations.\n\n## October\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Eye of the Temple\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5361030930653377\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/589940\\/Eye_of_the_Temple\\/) $19.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** An interesting example of a room-scale game.\n\n**From the store:** Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand. This game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m.\n\n**My thoughts:** I wanted to give this room-scale game the best chance for success. I went into my garage and had a nice wide open area to experience traversing the game world. From the image and description, I thought \"who doesn\\u2019t want to pretend to be Indiana Jones collecting treasure and whipping enemies?\" Well, it wasn\\u2019t like that at all. While the room-scale movement was very functional, the game play of collecting gems and struggling to get my whip working correctly was just not that engaging. I put in a decent amount of time with this, but going back and forth to figure out a puzzle and having to wait for the environment to give you the opportunity to move on, via moving blocks was time consuming and quickly lost my interest. If you have the room space and the idea of room scale gaming sounds interesting, it may be your cup of tea, but honestly, I would recommend you try out the [Tea for God](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3762343440541585\\/) demo on Quest for a bit more action, or [traVRsal](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3381040775329400\\/) for some real walking around at your own pace.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Killer Frequency\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4629225960449550\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1903620\\/Killer_Frequency\\/) $24.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A creepy fun time where you can live out your radio dj dreams.\n\n**From the store:** The year is 1987, and as the clock strikes midnight in small-town Gallows Creek, USA, former big city radio DJ Forrest Nash is live on air in what will turn out to be the graveyard shift of a lifetime. In this horror comedy, you must solve puzzles to save callers from being hunted down by a mysterious killer. Where every call is life and death, can you save the inhabitants of Gallows Creek?\n\n**My thoughts:** This is a really unique game that I quite enjoyed most of the way through. Paced appropriately, you\\u2019ll work your way through saving citizens from a killer that\\u2019s loose on the streets via phone calls. While you don\\u2019t have a lot of freedom in the game, the game has a story to tell and guides you deftly through multiple puzzles that are different and interesting. I had a good time messing around with the dj equipment and exploring the radio station as it opened up as the game progressed. The game was certainly creepy and tense at times, but not overtly horror filled. I did lose some steam at the end, but saw it through. You can replay the game to try and save (or kill) more citizens, but a lack of fast forward\\/skipping scenes put me off from that.\\u00a0 Also, since it was so tightly scripted, I wished that there would have been some interactions with callers or my co-host when I pressed sound board buttons, or played music. Overall, a unique game that is absolutely worth a look if the trailer interests you.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Dungeons of Eternity\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6341779295861881\\/) $29.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** One of the best games on the Quest, especially if you have a friend or two.\n\n**From the store:** When a cataclysmic cosmic event threatens your homeworld, the only hope for survival lies within the endless labyrinth of dungeons on the forsaken planet known as Eternity. Hack-n-slash takes on a new meaning in VR: swing swords, throw axes, use bows, wield magic staffs, and more to make it out alive. With the power of VR, you will be immersed in a fantasy adventure like no other.\n\n**My thoughts:** This co-op dungeon crawler has a gameplay loop that is supremely satisfying. With randomly generated rooms that change a few times every hour, you and your buddies will have a new adventure to play each time. The amount of loot, cosmetics and camaraderie that you get from each run gives you a sense of satisfaction that I rarely see from games on Quest. This is the type of game where you finish a run and just want to play one more time. With minimal bugs, a thriving Discord community and new items being added often, now is the time to jump into this one. Solo is good, but co-op is really where the fun is at - talking about what path to take, reviving your fallen warriors and sharing the joy of new loot is incredible. Seldom have I seen a game this polished at launch, and it's only gotten better. Pick this one up for sure.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Time Stall\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/2055554051161375\\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A fun puzzle game with a frozen-in-time twist that has playful characters.\n\n**From the store:** Welcome aboard the Fantastic Leap, Earth's only crowdfunded, luxury escape craft! As the only human serving alongside a robotic crew, your job is to keep the ship safe using TIME STALL, the ship's time-bending safety protocol. When disaster strikes, Time Stall temporarily freezes time aboard the ship, allowing you to manipulate objects, divert projectiles and combine various objects\\u2026whatever it takes to save the ship and her Captain from destruction!\n\n**My thoughts:** This was a unique puzzle game with the catch being that time slowed for the objects around you giving you a limited amount of time to to solve the problem by manipulating items around the environment. Each puzzle was unique and interesting, but the extra hidden objectives for each level weren\\u2019t enough to keep me around replaying it after I finished. A shorter game for sure, but the unique premise is enough for me to recommend it. The fun and quirky characters and playful interactions you can have were well thought out. Just don\\u2019t go in expecting a multiple hour adventure.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### First Encounters\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6236169136472090\\/) Free\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A neat free adventure to try out mixed reality.\n\n**From the store:** Discover mixed reality on Meta Quest 3 with First Encounters. You are on a strange new planet and pesky space puffians are about to flood into your room. Catch as many as you can before time runs out \\u2013 match colors for a high score!\n\n**My thoughts:** This is the type of game you\\u2019ll play for 10-15 minutes and then probably not play again. The proof of concept with mixed reality shown here is quite good, but the gameplay is a bit light. This is the type of game to show off to family and friends to get them excited about what the Quest 3 color passthrough can do. Try it out for sure just to see the potential of mixed reality.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Shores of Loci\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6574680562603944\\/) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1846890\\/Shores_of_Loci\\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** [**Puzzling Places**](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3931148300302917\\/)\\u00a0with a light story and far fewer puzzles.\n\n**From the store:** The Shores of Loci is a single-player narrative puzzle game that can only be experienced in VR. With compelling characters, beautiful cinematic scenes, and surreal worlds, the Shores of Loci will transport you to other dimensions to create visions larger than life.\\u00a0 In this multidimensional story, Giants and Villagers alike need your help to reclaim their lands and rebuild their cities. Complete your journey creating a universe where puzzled pieces are assembled and transformed.\n\n**My thoughts:** This game kept popping up as a recommendation and I honestly knew nothing about it. At the end of the day, it\\u2019s Puzzling Places, but you\\u2019re creating other worldly cities for aliens to live in. There\\u2019s a story there, but it\\u2019s superficial at best. If you like Puzzling Places, you may get something out of this, but for me it was over too fast and I\\u2019d probably have rather bought a DLC pack in Puzzling Places for more replayability. A neat time, but I believe you can skip this one.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### The Break-In\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6211388292305549\\/?utm_source=applabgamelist.com) \\/ [Steam](https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1397390\\/The_BreakIn\\/) $14.99\n\n**My quick thoughts:** A wacky break-in simulator\n\n**From the store:** The Break-In is a 4 player online co-op burglary game about sneaking into houses, stores, and casino vaults to steal everything that isn't bolted down. (And maybe some of the things which are bolted down). If you can get it into your van, you can sell it for a profit. And you can use the money you make to purchase new thief equipment, to help you take on riskier heists\n\n**My thoughts:**\\u00a0I felt the [Thief Simulator VR: Greenview Street](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3395626290543887\\/) vibes immediately from this one, but without the polish. While similar, this game does have it's different game play loop of upgrading your vehicle, tools and multiple locations. There is a fair amount of jank which can lead to a bit of frustration when trying to be silent or sneaky. The main appeal, and what I think is going to make me keep this on my system is the four player co-op. While the jank was still there, spending time in VR with friends always makes things better, and the laughs and stories we had narrowly escaping the cops, or getting away with breaking a window and not getting caught was a blast. Personally, I liked making my own stories - like moving the fridge upside down and wondering what the residents will say when they wake up. For now, I'll say this is a pickup only with friends.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### Just Another Cooking Game\n\n[Quest](https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6766207633442740\\/) Free\n\n**My quick thoughts:** Another cooking game, but very bare bones.\n\n**From the store:** Just Another Cooking Game is a time management game inspired by several other cooking games such as Overcooked and Cook-Out. JACG is also part of a PhD research project focused on understanding what factors enhance immersion and presence in VR games.\\u00a0Play the experience to unlock 12 more levels. Serve all robots as fast as possible to unlock the next level. Cook Under Pressure and see if you can handle the heat!\n\n**My thoughts:** There\\u2019s a ton of cooking games out there, almost too many to mention. It\\u2019s certainly as advertised, and if you\\u2019ve never played the genre before, this is an easy way to get a taste of what they\\u2019re like for free. You can\\u2019t go wrong with the price, but veterans of the genre won\\u2019t find anything new here. This is for newcomers wanting to sample the genre only.\n\n**\\ud83d\\udcf7**\n\n### ",

In either case, here are my quick thoughts on the 22 games I played from September through October 2023.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TLDR: My top 5 games to check out from this list are at the bottom and so is some info for a game giveaway.&lt;\\/em&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Games Played In September&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Track Craft (Demo)&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/10038131272867316\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; Free&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Hot Wheels inspired racing with an extremely generous demo.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Ready to take a joyride down memory lane? Our mixed reality game for the Meta Quest 2, 3, and Pro brings back the childhood thrill of playing with cars with a twist. Craft your own racing tracks, share them with friends, and compete in high-speed races in a fully immersive environment. This demo version contains a demo track pack containing 20 levels, three cars, and a track editor to challenge your creativity.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This is a very generous demo of a Hot Wheels style car racing game that has shades of &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4397519526943470\\/\"&gt;Stunt Track Builder VR&lt;\\/a&gt;, but with its own unique take on it. While I didn\\u2019t find the track building as easy as in Stunt Track Builder VR, it has a campaign with time trials to beat, a variety of vehicles that handle differently, and user created levels that can keep you quite busy for hours. This is a generous free demo and I can\\u2019t wait to see how the full version shakes out. Absolutely give it a go if you like Hot Wheels or racing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;I Expect you to Die 3: Cog in the Machine&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4676322075753574\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2296380\\/I_Expect_You_To_Die_3_Cog_in_the_Machine\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A master-class in escape room games.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Outwit your most cunning adversary to date in the latest installment of this popular, spy-themed puzzle series. Wield new gadgets, visit action-packed locales, and wear custom disguises as you dive back into the world of espionage in this escape room game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This escape room game is a culmination of ideas, talent and creativity from the first two IEYTD games (three if you count &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4751810638214255\\/\"&gt;Home Sweet Home&lt;\\/a&gt;) that were all put into this title. The intro alone is worth the price of admission. With a great story, collectibles and reasons to go back to get the best score, or unlock achievements, this puzzle game has legs. This exceptional game continues to deliver smart puzzles and takes the franchise in different directions that I won\\u2019t spoil here. Give this one a go if you want to express your inner James Bond.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Poly Ego&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5860797560692158\\/?utm_source=www.google.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=oculusredirect\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2463490\\/Poly_Ego\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $14.99 &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6667623289970181\\/\"&gt;Demo&lt;\\/a&gt; Free&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Budget Portal - in a good way&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; So, you&amp;#39;ve got a knack for virtual reality and a touch of masochism? Fancy getting your digital head messed with in an uncanny world where logic is king and folly is your only solace? Well, dear misfit, step right up to Poly Ego. In the infinite space, you become an unsuspecting lab rat - well, lab robot, to be more precise. Thrust into a reality that teeters between &amp;quot;oh, that&amp;#39;s clever&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;why the hell am I doing this?&amp;quot;, you must navigate through a labyrinth of mind-bending puzzles, all while a robot named Bluepy keeps you company - and sometimes drives you mad.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; I started off by playing the demo of this clearly Portal inspired game. I\\u2019m not going to lie, the movement is not terribly intuitive and frankly tough to get used to. With a bit more polish, it could be a solid Portal-style game. While the game clearly wears its inspiration on its sleeve, it does lack the fine tuning that many games have. That being said, I found myself playing through the entire demo, slowly learning the controls and made my way to the end. I thought \\u201cwell, with some more polish, I wonder how a full game might look.\\u201d I then noticed they had a full game out. I&amp;#39;m 30 out of 40 levels in and am having quite a good time despite all my concerns. I&amp;#39;ve ran into game breaking bug, and the dev is quick to fix them. There are problems with this game, but the smart puzzles keep pulling me back. If you&amp;#39;re a Portal fan, give the demo a try for sure.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Trivia Crack VR&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6709385002410356\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; $9.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; There\\u2019s a lot of potential in this trivia game, but give it some time to develop.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This is a place full of fun and curiosity, where you can share your knowledge with others and prove that you are worthy of becoming the future director of the park. You&amp;#39;ll be able to compete in trivia matches and mini-games with people from all around the world or play on your own and beat your own high scores.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This game feels like it&amp;#39;s in early access, and I\\u2019d only recommend playing with friends currently. There is clearly a lot of work left to do in this game as it\\u2019s a bare bones 5-player trivia game with wildly inconsistent questions ranging from easy (What is Sponge Bob\\u2019s favorite food?) to very specific (What is the smallest island in the Galapagos?). I really think this will be a winner once they flesh out avatars, question difficulty and offer more modes and settings. Let this cook for a couple of months unless you\\u2019re dying for some VR trivia. I had a chance to chat with the developers and they really want to make a go of this on the main store, so they are committed to improvements. and it will stay on my Quest as a warmup game with friends.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Call of the Sea VR&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5174697242548672\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/agecheck\\/app\\/1042490\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $19.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; The captivating story pulls you through this solid puzzle adventure.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Call of the Sea VR is an otherworldly tale of mystery and love, set in the 1930s South Pacific. You\\u2019ll explore a lush island paradise, solve puzzles and unlock secrets in refreshing new ways with Meta Quest. Go on the hunt for your husband\\u2019s missing expedition as Norah Everhart, fully voice-acted by Cissy Jones (Firewatch, The Walking Dead: Season 1), and take in the beautiful sights of a cryptic land, uncovering occult mysteries and venturing through forgotten ruins.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This puzzle adventure game kept me intrigued and scratching my head a few times. Not terribly difficult, and not technically impressive, I did find the story very unique and the environments varied. I didn\\u2019t run into any glitches - a key in puzzle games, but I did find the hint system to be a bit too generous at times. If you haven\\u2019t had your fill of puzzle games, I\\u2019d suggest this one for the story and quality voice acting. At roughly 5-7 hours of gameplay, it\\u2019s one you can sink your teeth into.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;FTD: Find the Difference&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6055957821167625\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; Free&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick take:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A bit too clunky despite a lot of content.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Welcome to an enchanting world where your keen observation skills and VR technology intertwine to create a captivating gaming experience. Prepare yourself for an exciting journey through 18 distinct room types, ranging from a delightful bakery to a thrilling arcade and a warm living room. Your mission in this immersive VR game is to detect the differences between two versions of each room, using your visual acuity, memory, and problem-solving abilities.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This game was $15 and then it went free. While you could do worse on the app store, I just didn\\u2019t find the experience polished enough to keep playing. There are a lot of levels here to keep you busy finding the difference between environments, and with different difficulty levels if this one speaks to you, you\\u2019ll get some good game time out of it. For me though, it just didn\\u2019t click and I\\u2019d only recommend it for those fans of the genre.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Mini Golf Aeons&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/en-gb\\/experiences\\/4881013271998328\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; Free w\\/full game IAP \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/2335950\\/Mini_Golf_Aeons__Full_Game\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $11.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; The third best mini golf game I\\u2019ve played on Quest&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Get ready for the ultimate VR mini golf adventure with Mini Golf Aeons! Explore four distinct and exciting worlds, including a desert landscape, an ocean view, a prehistoric jungle, and a frozen Antarctic wonderland. Each world features beautifully designed and challenging courses that are based on real-life greens, ensuring a truly immersive and authentic experience.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; I\\u2019ve played a bunch of mini golf games on the Quest, and this is the third best I\\u2019ve played. It will soon be the second when Golf+ removes their mini golf game. While this isn\\u2019t going to replace Walkabout Mini Golf, it\\u2019s doing it&amp;#39;s own thing and going for a more realistic environment than WMG. A bit clunky and slow (you have to wait a few seconds to putt until you hear a bell), I didn\\u2019t get into a good flow after the first course (9 holes). The putting did feel pretty solid though. It was quite close to feeling like real life - with a few tweaks still needed in my opinion. The demo didn\\u2019t compel me to buy the full game, but I\\u2019d certainly keep an eye out because it really is close to being very a very solid game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Yupitergrad 2: The Lost Station&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4446075785447064\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1969000\\/Yupitergrad_2_The_Lost_Station\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A Metroidvania style game that loses steam halfway in.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Epic action-adventure is back. Yupitergrad 2 raises the stakes. Check out the refined movement and combat system, evade obstacles, and see what surprises the new space journey will bring. Taste new challenges, use new items &amp;amp; discover the secret of the abandoned base. It&amp;#39;s a mix of arcade, parkour, and puzzles, Metroidvania style. It&amp;#39;s an experience that has never been deeply explored in VR before.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; I was really excited to play this sequel. I quite enjoyed the first game. The swinging gameplay and physics were spot on, and more of the same sounded good - with the added benefit of a Metroidvania style game. While the core gameplay was still solid, much to my disappointment, the upgrades and game itself quickly lost my interest. Halfway through, the constant back and forth of exacting platforming grew to be quite the chore. With most Metroidvania games, you open up a new secret path to avoid a lot of backtracking, but that is not the case with this game, you&amp;#39;re stuck taking the long road back again, and again. While I did finish it, and the story was fun, the game didn\\u2019t have the same pizazz as the first. Honestly, I\\u2019d skip this one, and if you haven\\u2019t played either, absolutely go with the first as it has a lot more content to keep you busy.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;EarthQuest&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6320120764784270\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; $4.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; An app that tries hard to be &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/348250\\/Google_Earth_VR\\/\"&gt;Google Earth&lt;\\/a&gt; on Quest&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Street View Integration: I&amp;#39;m thrilled to also introduce the integration of Google Street View into EarthQuest, taking your exploration to a whole new level. Single Player Mode: I&amp;#39;ve implemented a Single Player mode to provide a quality-focused solo experience. It&amp;#39;s optimized for smoother gameplay and features a refreshed user interface (UI).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Considering the limitations of the Quest and all the data that Google Earth is calling for, this is an impressive app. It\\u2019s certainly not as good as Google Earth on Steam proper, but if you don\\u2019t have access to that, this is the second best option. While a bit clunky to navigate, slow to load at times, and not as graphically impressive, EarthQuest is something fun to experiment and play with. If this is something that interests you even mildly, you could do worse for $4.99. Give it a try, but know that there are some real limitations.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;October&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Eye of the Temple&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/5361030930653377\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/589940\\/Eye_of_the_Temple\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $19.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; An interesting example of a room-scale game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Embark on an adventure to explore a vast and treacherous temple and uncover the ancient legend of the Eye. Keep your balance as you step between moving blocks, dodging hazardous traps and solving environmental puzzles with just your torch and whip in hand. This game requires a play area of at least 2m x 2m.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; I wanted to give this room-scale game the best chance for success. I went into my garage and had a nice wide open area to experience traversing the game world. From the image and description, I thought &amp;quot;who doesn\\u2019t want to pretend to be Indiana Jones collecting treasure and whipping enemies?&amp;quot; Well, it wasn\\u2019t like that at all. While the room-scale movement was very functional, the game play of collecting gems and struggling to get my whip working correctly was just not that engaging. I put in a decent amount of time with this, but going back and forth to figure out a puzzle and having to wait for the environment to give you the opportunity to move on, via moving blocks was time consuming and quickly lost my interest. If you have the room space and the idea of room scale gaming sounds interesting, it may be your cup of tea, but honestly, I would recommend you try out the &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3762343440541585\\/\"&gt;Tea for God&lt;\\/a&gt; demo on Quest for a bit more action, or &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3381040775329400\\/\"&gt;traVRsal&lt;\\/a&gt; for some real walking around at your own pace.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Killer Frequency&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/4629225960449550\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1903620\\/Killer_Frequency\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $24.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A creepy fun time where you can live out your radio dj dreams.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; The year is 1987, and as the clock strikes midnight in small-town Gallows Creek, USA, former big city radio DJ Forrest Nash is live on air in what will turn out to be the graveyard shift of a lifetime. In this horror comedy, you must solve puzzles to save callers from being hunted down by a mysterious killer. Where every call is life and death, can you save the inhabitants of Gallows Creek?&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This is a really unique game that I quite enjoyed most of the way through. Paced appropriately, you\\u2019ll work your way through saving citizens from a killer that\\u2019s loose on the streets via phone calls. While you don\\u2019t have a lot of freedom in the game, the game has a story to tell and guides you deftly through multiple puzzles that are different and interesting. I had a good time messing around with the dj equipment and exploring the radio station as it opened up as the game progressed. The game was certainly creepy and tense at times, but not overtly horror filled. I did lose some steam at the end, but saw it through. You can replay the game to try and save (or kill) more citizens, but a lack of fast forward\\/skipping scenes put me off from that.\\u00a0 Also, since it was so tightly scripted, I wished that there would have been some interactions with callers or my co-host when I pressed sound board buttons, or played music. Overall, a unique game that is absolutely worth a look if the trailer interests you.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Dungeons of Eternity&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6341779295861881\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; $29.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; One of the best games on the Quest, especially if you have a friend or two.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; When a cataclysmic cosmic event threatens your homeworld, the only hope for survival lies within the endless labyrinth of dungeons on the forsaken planet known as Eternity. Hack-n-slash takes on a new meaning in VR: swing swords, throw axes, use bows, wield magic staffs, and more to make it out alive. With the power of VR, you will be immersed in a fantasy adventure like no other.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This co-op dungeon crawler has a gameplay loop that is supremely satisfying. With randomly generated rooms that change a few times every hour, you and your buddies will have a new adventure to play each time. The amount of loot, cosmetics and camaraderie that you get from each run gives you a sense of satisfaction that I rarely see from games on Quest. This is the type of game where you finish a run and just want to play one more time. With minimal bugs, a thriving Discord community and new items being added often, now is the time to jump into this one. Solo is good, but co-op is really where the fun is at - talking about what path to take, reviving your fallen warriors and sharing the joy of new loot is incredible. Seldom have I seen a game this polished at launch, and it&amp;#39;s only gotten better. Pick this one up for sure.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Time Stall&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/2055554051161375\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A fun puzzle game with a frozen-in-time twist that has playful characters.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Welcome aboard the Fantastic Leap, Earth&amp;#39;s only crowdfunded, luxury escape craft! As the only human serving alongside a robotic crew, your job is to keep the ship safe using TIME STALL, the ship&amp;#39;s time-bending safety protocol. When disaster strikes, Time Stall temporarily freezes time aboard the ship, allowing you to manipulate objects, divert projectiles and combine various objects\\u2026whatever it takes to save the ship and her Captain from destruction!&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This was a unique puzzle game with the catch being that time slowed for the objects around you giving you a limited amount of time to to solve the problem by manipulating items around the environment. Each puzzle was unique and interesting, but the extra hidden objectives for each level weren\\u2019t enough to keep me around replaying it after I finished. A shorter game for sure, but the unique premise is enough for me to recommend it. The fun and quirky characters and playful interactions you can have were well thought out. Just don\\u2019t go in expecting a multiple hour adventure.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;First Encounters&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6236169136472090\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; Free&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A neat free adventure to try out mixed reality.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Discover mixed reality on Meta Quest 3 with First Encounters. You are on a strange new planet and pesky space puffians are about to flood into your room. Catch as many as you can before time runs out \\u2013 match colors for a high score!&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This is the type of game you\\u2019ll play for 10-15 minutes and then probably not play again. The proof of concept with mixed reality shown here is quite good, but the gameplay is a bit light. This is the type of game to show off to family and friends to get them excited about what the Quest 3 color passthrough can do. Try it out for sure just to see the potential of mixed reality.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Shores of Loci&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6574680562603944\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1846890\\/Shores_of_Loci\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3931148300302917\\/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puzzling Places&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/a&gt;\\u00a0with a light story and far fewer puzzles.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; The Shores of Loci is a single-player narrative puzzle game that can only be experienced in VR. With compelling characters, beautiful cinematic scenes, and surreal worlds, the Shores of Loci will transport you to other dimensions to create visions larger than life.\\u00a0 In this multidimensional story, Giants and Villagers alike need your help to reclaim their lands and rebuild their cities. Complete your journey creating a universe where puzzled pieces are assembled and transformed.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; This game kept popping up as a recommendation and I honestly knew nothing about it. At the end of the day, it\\u2019s Puzzling Places, but you\\u2019re creating other worldly cities for aliens to live in. There\\u2019s a story there, but it\\u2019s superficial at best. If you like Puzzling Places, you may get something out of this, but for me it was over too fast and I\\u2019d probably have rather bought a DLC pack in Puzzling Places for more replayability. A neat time, but I believe you can skip this one.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Break-In&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6211388292305549\\/?utm_source=applabgamelist.com\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; \\/ &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/store.steampowered.com\\/app\\/1397390\\/The_BreakIn\\/\"&gt;Steam&lt;\\/a&gt; $14.99&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; A wacky break-in simulator&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; The Break-In is a 4 player online co-op burglary game about sneaking into houses, stores, and casino vaults to steal everything that isn&amp;#39;t bolted down. (And maybe some of the things which are bolted down). If you can get it into your van, you can sell it for a profit. And you can use the money you make to purchase new thief equipment, to help you take on riskier heists&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt;\\u00a0I felt the &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/3395626290543887\\/\"&gt;Thief Simulator VR: Greenview Street&lt;\\/a&gt; vibes immediately from this one, but without the polish. While similar, this game does have it&amp;#39;s different game play loop of upgrading your vehicle, tools and multiple locations. There is a fair amount of jank which can lead to a bit of frustration when trying to be silent or sneaky. The main appeal, and what I think is going to make me keep this on my system is the four player co-op. While the jank was still there, spending time in VR with friends always makes things better, and the laughs and stories we had narrowly escaping the cops, or getting away with breaking a window and not getting caught was a blast. Personally, I liked making my own stories - like moving the fridge upside down and wondering what the residents will say when they wake up. For now, I&amp;#39;ll say this is a pickup only with friends.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Just Another Cooking Game&lt;\\/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.meta.com\\/experiences\\/6766207633442740\\/\"&gt;Quest&lt;\\/a&gt; Free&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My quick thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Another cooking game, but very bare bones.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the store:&lt;\\/strong&gt; Just Another Cooking Game is a time management game inspired by several other cooking games such as Overcooked and Cook-Out. JACG is also part of a PhD research project focused on understanding what factors enhance immersion and presence in VR games.\\u00a0Play the experience to unlock 12 more levels. Serve all robots as fast as possible to unlock the next level. Cook Under Pressure and see if you can handle the heat!&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My thoughts:&lt;\\/strong&gt; There\\u2019s a ton of cooking games out there, almost too many to mention. It\\u2019s certainly as advertised, and if you\\u2019ve never played the genre before, this is an easy way to get a taste of what they\\u2019re like for free. You can\\u2019t go wrong with the price, but veterans of the genre won\\u2019t find anything new here. This is for newcomers wanting to sample the genre only.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\\ud83d\\udcf7&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "There's a stigma since the existence of gaming that video games are \"bad for you\", especially if played extensively. Spine issues, heart issues, muscle inactivity, and many more health-related as well as lifestyle-related issues have been linked to video games, possibly for a good reason. It's easy to fall into the grasp of addiction and just crash all your free time into the world's most subtle escape from reality. Buried under the pile of countless critics, gaming has had more than a fair share of judgment from all social groups. Well, I'm here to offer another perspective - an outlook on how video games changed someone's life for the better and helped them become a better human being overall.\n\nI'd like to start with the negatives. Addiction to video games? 3 times. And 3 solid recoveries. With the experience I have today, I can say that every time my life went downhill, video games substituted as life's motherly arms for all my fears and burdens. But as every baby bird has to leave its nest at some point, I did too. Along this journey, I discovered VR gaming which at first, looked like another cool way of spending my time in the virtual world. Playing games like **Half-Life: Alyx**, Into the Radius, Clash of Chefs, and others gave me a new perspective of how awesome gaming *could* be in the future, but also a new idea. What if I could utilize the new dimension inherent only to VR to my advantage? What if I could improve my life *while* doing something I love, and turn my prolonged gaming periods that would otherwise have a negative impact on my health into something that would improve me physically, while also helping me deal with my mental issues? What if I could turn this into a win-win situation?\n\n**Fitness games &amp; their benefits**\n\nThe \"dimension inherent to VR\" I mentioned before refers mainly to the 3rd dimension present in VR gaming that's absent in all other forms of gaming. Similarly to how the Heliocentric system changed our entire understanding of how the world around us functioned, the physicality of the VR's third dimension changed my perception of how gaming could work. Instead of being stuck to a chair and looking into a 2D, flat screen for hours, I had the opportunity to play while being active in my room, with my body as a controller. That's when I looked for ways to combine the enjoyment of playing a game with the perk of being physically active and ultimately decided on 2 games.\n\nI got myself **Beat Saber** and **PowerBeatsVR**, of which the latter provided me with an exceptional way to keep my body in shape. Just a few high intensity runs in this game made me fight for breath completely covered in sweat, even though I wasn't *that* out of shape. The most important part for me was the option to choose my own music because the music I enjoy changes depending on my mood, and when I'm not mentally well, my mood changes rather quickly. Even irl I jump between oldschool rock, blues, powermetal, and folk music literally song by song. I made a plan and stuck to it - daily runs of 30 to 60 minutes in PowerBeatsVR with my own, custom songs, and as hard as I could go. I lost a few pounds, tightened my muscles, and overall felt much more energized on a daily basis due to being physically active. The best part was that I was enjoying every moment in the game because it represented something familiar and safe to me - a *video game* with real video game features, cool sceneries, etc. If you're struggling right now with improving your physical fitness or just want to do something healthy for yourself in your free time, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game. It works even for people who are extremely out of shape or injured because you can choose your own pace.\n\nI'd also recommend Beat Saber for the same purpose. It's leaning more toward the *game* than the *fitness* part, but it'll also burn a few calories if you do the runs correctly. Just be careful not to dislocate or hurt your shoulder\\/arm (it happened to me twice) and make sure to warm up properly before doing harder runs (especially if you're above 30 hahaha). Either way, you'll have a ton of fun while doing something good for yourself, and that's always a plus.\n\n**Mental health benefits**\n\nNow, this is one of the things VR games share with flatscreen games - mental health benefits - although I'd argue VR games could have an edge solely because of the unmatched immersiveness. I can't explain how much **Into the Radius** and **Resident Evil 4 VR** helped me deal with anxiety, an issue I'd been battling for years. Playing these games helped me get in touch with my anxious side and understand fear better, at least in terms of how it functions in my dysfunctional body. I could sense and tell apart real fear from anxious attacks, and subsequently deal with them before they get control over me. Plus, my fear tolerance increased significantly.\n\nThen I'd also like to mention the games like **Deisim** or **cyubeVR** that provide a cozy and fun environment to just lose yourself in, relax, and have fun. If life gets too rough, this could be the right way to deal with it, although be careful not to stray too far.\n\n**Fun &amp; Entertainment**\n\nLast but not least, VR games have always provided so much fun to me for a very affordable price. One of the reasons I became a gamer as a kid was because my family didn't do too well financially. We sometimes couldn't afford to go to lunches, dinners, vacations, etc., and I as a kid learned to cherish and save every $ we had. Video games were the cheapest form of entertainment I could have - $500 for a PC that lasted for 4 years and $10-$30 per game was so much cheaper than going out to cafes, bars, and when online games came around, I could even hang out with friends while playing games.\n\nIn today's world, VR is arguably one of the best ways to have fun and experience some things second-handedly while being in the comfort of your home and saving your money. With so many simulators and interesting apps out there, virtually anything from the real world can be done in VR with a bit of creativity. Although I'm not an expert, some games still left an oustanding impact on me - **Wooorld**, **Bartender Simulator VR**, **Cooking Simulator VR**, **Clash of Chefs**, **Nature Treks VR**, and **The Climb**.\n\n**The Conclusion**\n\nTo wrap this up, I'll return to the beginning of the article and say that VR, like any other form of gaming, can impact your life negatively if used excessively. No matter how good you feel doing even some cool, extraordinary things in VR, don't do it too much or too obsessively. HOWEVER, if you want to utilize VR to your advantage, I'd say the games I mentioned in this post could be perfect for that. PowerBeatsVR will help you get in shape for sure, and you'll have a ton of fun doing it. Into the Radius could help you deal with anxiety, but don't force yourself too much if the feeling overwhelms you. The Climb is a solid climbing simulator and it'll let you experience the sport second-hand, without you risking anything. There are more examples like Nature Treks VR which lets you experience the immersiveness of nature without having to step a foot outside, or Beat Saber which will have you burning extra calories while competing for high scores in a rhythm game. And these are only some examples that I've done in the past, just imagine how much more is out there.\n\nWhen it's all said and done, VR games helped me change my life for the better and find new ways of bettering myself in things I've never thought possible before. Hope it does the same for you.\n\nCheers!\n\n\\*NOTE - I highlighted all the games so you don't have to go through the blocks of text searching for them in case you wanna look them up.",

Although I&amp;#39;m not an expert, some games still left an oustanding impact on me - &lt;strong&gt;Wooorld&lt;\\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bartender Simulator VR&lt;\\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Cooking Simulator VR&lt;\\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Clash of Chefs&lt;\\/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nature Treks VR&lt;\\/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;The Climb&lt;\\/strong&gt;.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Conclusion&lt;\\/strong&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To wrap this up, I&amp;#39;ll return to the beginning of the article and say that VR, like any other form of gaming, can impact your life negatively if used excessively. No matter how good you feel doing even some cool, extraordinary things in VR, don&amp;#39;t do it too much or too obsessively. HOWEVER, if you want to utilize VR to your advantage, I&amp;#39;d say the games I mentioned in this post could be perfect for that. PowerBeatsVR will help you get in shape for sure, and you&amp;#39;ll have a ton of fun doing it. Into the Radius could help you deal with anxiety, but don&amp;#39;t force yourself too much if the feeling overwhelms you. The Climb is a solid climbing simulator and it&amp;#39;ll let you experience the sport second-hand, without you risking anything. There are more examples like Nature Treks VR which lets you experience the immersiveness of nature without having to step a foot outside, or Beat Saber which will have you burning extra calories while competing for high scores in a rhythm game. And these are only some examples that I&amp;#39;ve done in the past, just imagine how much more is out there.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;#39;s all said and done, VR games helped me change my life for the better and find new ways of bettering myself in things I&amp;#39;ve never thought possible before. Hope it does the same for you.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*NOTE - I highlighted all the games so you don&amp;#39;t have to go through the blocks of text searching for them in case you wanna look them up.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

At least for me the head movement tracking is exceptional and doesn't feel laggy in the slightest. Very natural. So when you move your head and look around it feels completely believable. \n2. The menus and applications look very crisp, a virtual monitor for example looks almost as good as in real life, and if you have it at the right distance it's really very clear and sharp. Even text can be very clear. \n3. Youtube VR has to be the biggest disappointment. I don't know maybe I'm just not looking at high enough quality, but I tried a few 360 and 180 videos and the quality is too low to really get into it. This one video I tried through featured this lady playing a contrabass on a bridge and even with the low visual quality, it was still quite informative. I immediately saw the potential in it for learning fingerstyle guitar - But I don't think content like that has fully been explored or developed. Is Youtube VR (the app) a total write off? Maybe not there's the usual 2d viewing experience there too, but obviously comes with adverts unless you have premium. Let's just say though. I'm not really sold on Youtube VR. \n4. Watching 2d movies: I didn't watch an entire film. For that I would need to solve the battery life issue and have more freetime. But I tested the idea in principle and yes, it would absolutely work. There's this theatre mode that if you zone out a bit makes you feel like you're really there. Very cool indeed. The perception of being in front of a very large screen is also believable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlright let's jump right into the porn experience. Let's do a pros and cons list :   \n\n\nPros : \n\n1. Very lifelike at times. And I'm talking now specifically about CzechVR. Even with streaming alone, there are times when it feels like the girl is standing right in front of you. When they get the distance just right and the camera angle aligned correctly, ect. There are times when the experience becomes real (almost\\*). \n2. Eye contact : It's very good and creates the immersion. You actually feel connected to the actress in a way 2d porn cannot deliver. \n3. The scale is correct. So you feel like you're next to someone real. It gives you an appreciation for how hot these girls actually are. \n4. When the distance is correct, the attention to detail is astonishing. I would dare say a 1:1 mapping with reality. That is there are times when you cannot distinguish the difference. \n\nCons: \n\n1. Not everything is so clear and crisp. I found only certain regions of the viewing experience. \n2. When they get too close everything goes out of focus and it completely destroys the immersion. \n3. Not sure how to solve this but while lying on your back, you need very specific content (or maybe I need a better viewer). But when you're streaming even after setting up boundaries there seems to be no way to move your viewpoint. So to see the content you either need to sit up or stand up. Instead of being able to move the content into view. Often I found myself just looking at her head because when you're on your back you can't really look down. Would be nice if there was some kind of solution to this. \n4. Boundaries - The quest 3 seems a bit over protective. And the boundaries show up if you move even slightly to the left or right from a stationary mapped position. I don't know maybe this is because I didn't map the whole room? Would be nice to be able to just turn off the whole boundaries feature but I didn't find that option. \n\nOther than that, those are small and very minor complaints.   \n\n\nAny tips and tricks from this point on would be most useful. Thanks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The group thought everyone in the world was a bit too stressed, so they choose to make a jokes video! They researched, practiced and delivered all their own jokes (some very good ones too!) \nAvailable Now on SkyWatcherVR channels - \nDeoVR (full 5.7k) - https:\\/\\/deovr.com\\/4wj4cr \nor \nYouTubeVR (4k) - https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/MFz0cf0RMQw \nPlease watch and let us know if it cheered you up!\n\nThey made a VR Train Simulator app for PC - \"Breffni MG Train\". Using Unity3D game engine, the group were guided in creating the train and landscapes themselves. We used ChatGPT to help with the coding, and SkyboxAI to create the skies. \nhttps:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/SkyWatcherVR\\/status\\/1721904662717382869\n\nThey made the world's first VR and Mixed Reality Bodhran, a mobile VR app for Oculus Quest 2\\/3. This will be going into a real world app, more info to come. Using Unity3D game engine, the group were guided in creating the Bodhran and Beater themselves. We used ChatGPT to help with the coding, and SkyboxAI to create the skies. There will be more news coming soon on how you can get to play the VR Bodhran, and much more news about Instrument Studio VR coming to Quest ;) \nhttps:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/SkyWatcherVR\\/status\\/1721906631724712368\n\nSurprisingly, all members of the group were able to create and manipulate objects in 3D space without any problem. Their spatial awareness and understanding was no different from groups without disabilities. An untapped area of their brains, which needs to be utilized.\n\nThe dawn of AI assistance technology, can be the greatest asset ever to people with ID. It can be an assistant, teacher, companion, planner. It can make them more intellectually equal, allowing them to do more meaningful and better jobs, rather than just packing shopping. It can use voice and text to speech for enhanced accessibility, and in the future BCI and AI will open the world for everyone with disabilities.\n\nPeople with ID need jobs and careers with varied tasks, that challenge and stimulate them. This can be possible with AI, we can set the bar higher in their aspirations. People might lose jobs because of AI, but people with ID may gain jobs.\n\nWe have used the VR Video and Apps created by this group, to use as VR experiences for other groups with mental health &amp; learning disabilities. There can be an exciting future in facilitating groups to learn and create apps to benefit their own communities, and for people without disabilities.\n\nWe would like to roll out more projects like this, to more groups with ID (Adult and Youth). We want to explore further how personalized AI, can help these groups in all aspects of their lives.\n\nWe showcased the 3 projects to family, friends and reps from Intreo, Learning Networks and Disability groups, at Breffni Family Resource Centre on 7th November 2023.\n\nPlease DM for more info, if you want to setup similar projects, or if you want to assist\\/sponsor in any way.\n\nThanks for taking time to read :)",

I'm honestly already thinking of getting rid of it just because the sweet spot basically makes it seem like i can only see a small area in the center so even reading text is annoying.",

I&amp;#39;m honestly already thinking of getting rid of it just because the sweet spot basically makes it seem like i can only see a small area in the center so even reading text is annoying.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The prompt used is attached [here](https:\\/\\/pastebin.com\\/nzbQfmzz). The result is very impressive and captured the key points made by most reviewers. Enjoy.\n\n# Meta Quest 3 Meta-Review\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is the latest standalone virtual reality headset from Meta, released in October 2023 as the successor to the popular Meta Quest 2. With upgrades like pancake lenses, improved displays, better ergonomics, full-color mixed reality capabilities, and more powerful internals, the Quest 3 aims to push standalone VR forward and set the stage for mainstream mixed reality adoption.\n\nBased on reviews from 20 major VR\\/tech outlets, here is a comprehensive look at the Quest 3\\u2019s design, features, performance, software ecosystem, and overall value as Meta\\u2019s new 6DOF consumer headset.\n\n## Design and Ergonomics\n\nThe Quest 3 retains a similar overall design language to the Quest 2, but with some key improvements. The headset is around 40% slimmer thanks to the use of pancake lenses, providing a sleeker and less bulky profile. However, the Quest 3 is slightly heavier at 515g vs 503g for the Quest 2. The majority of reviewers found the Quest 3 more balanced and comfortable to wear than its predecessor.\n\n* The weight sits closer to the face compared to the Quest 2, reducing the \"front heaviness\" that could cause slipping.\n* The redesigned strap features a split headband that better distributes weight and accommodates ponytails. Most testers could wear it comfortably for 1-2 hours, though the elite strap accessory is still recommended for longer sessions.\n* The new facial interface uses softer, more breathable fabrics. Glasses can be accommodated by buttons inside the visor to extend eye relief, replacing the need for a separate spacer.\n* IPD adjustment is now continuous via a manual slider, allowing more precise settings vs the Quest 2's 3-point preset system. The adjustable range is also wider at 58\\u201375 mm.\n* Setup is streamlined, now able to scan the user's environment and automatically generate guardian boundaries for room-scale VR.\n\nHowever, some issues remain regarding long-term comfort. The front-heavy weight distribution still causes forehead pressure for some users. Meta's Elite Strap upgrades are recommended, but add $70-130 to the cost. The facial interface lacks a light-blocking nose flap, allowing some peripheral light bleed. Fogging can still be an issue initially until the lenses warm up. Third party alternatives may provide better solutions.\n\n## Displays and Optics\n\nThe Quest 3 utilizes dual LCD displays at 2064 \\u00d7 2208 pixels per eye, a 30% increase over the Quest 2's 1832 x 1920 resolution. The pixel density hits 25 PPD, surpassing all prior Quest headsets. The new pancake lenses provide a wide, consistent sweet spot and reduced glare.\n\n* Image clarity and sharpness see a noticeable improvement, especially for text. Screen door effect is virtually eliminated.\n* Field of view receives a minor boost to 110\\u00b0 horizontal and 96\\u00b0 vertical. The expanded sweet spot makes the FOV increase more perceivable.\n* Visuals remain crisp across the entire lens area. No more \"looking through a porthole\" effect or having to find the center sweet spot.\n* God rays and flare are significantly reduced compared to fresnel lenses. Some minor glare may still be visible at high contrasts.\n\nThe lack of OLED displays means contrast and black levels are still more grayish than competitors like the PSVR 2. But most reviewers considered the Quest 3's visuals the best of any standalone headset under $1000. It closes much of the gap with tethered headsets.\n\n## Hardware and Performance\n\nThe Quest 3 introduces the new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor. Meta quotes the chipset providing a 2.5x graphics performance uplift over Quest 2's XR2 Gen 1.\n\n* The CPU receives a modest 33% boost, but the GPU power doubles. This translates to significantly higher rendering capabilities and smoother frame rates in VR.\n* Loading times can be 10-30% faster. Some games see major visual upgrades with higher resolution textures, better shadows and lighting, and increased environmental detail.\n* Handling of complex scenes with lots of characters or physics improves noticeably.\n\nThe 8GB RAM adds a bit more headroom vs the Quest 2's 6GB. However, some felt 12GB would have better matched the Quest Pro and prepared for future growth. The 5060 mAh battery lasts around 2-3 hours on a charge, similar to the Quest 2. It takes about 2.5 hours to recharge fully with the included 18W charger. Faster charging would have been nice given the added power draw.\n\n## Controllers and Tracking\n\nMeta's redesigned Touch Plus controllers drop the large tracking rings. This slims them down and improves ergonomics. The controllers use infrared LEDs for 6DOF tracking by the headset's cameras, aided by computer vision algorithms and hand tracking data.\n\n* Despite fewer LEDs, most reviewers found the tracking accuracy and speed equal or superior to the Quest 2 Touch controllers. Blind spots can occur when controllers are moved behind the head.\n* The streamlined design enables more natural hand postures without worrying about bashing the rings together.\n* New haptics via voice coil actuators provide improved feedback nuance and realism.\n* Battery life remains similar to Quest 2, lasting months on easily swappable AA batteries.\n\nHand tracking receives some latency and performance improvements, but still has limitations in tracking range and accuracy vs controllers. It enables basic menu navigation, but most find controllers preferable for interactivity.\n\n## Audio and Microphone\n\nIntegrated speakers in the headband provide simulated spatial audio. Volume output sees a noticeable boost over Quest 2 with richer bass, rated at 40% louder maximum levels. Microphone quality remains similar to prior Quest mics, suitable for social chat but not particularly impressive. The 3.5mm jack allows use of headphones or earbuds for private listening.\n\n## Mixed Reality &amp; Passthrough\n\nMixed reality and full color passthrough represent the Quest 3's biggest technical leap past its predecessors. Dual RGB cameras plus a depth sensor facilitate blending of real-world visuals with VR overlays.\n\n* Passthrough visual quality is heavily dependent on lighting conditions. Well-lit rooms provide a reasonably clear view where flat screens and handheld devices can be legible. Dim conditions introduce more noise.\n* The color accuracy and clarity surpasses the Quest Pro's passthrough by a wide margin, despite the latter's higher resolution.\n* Environmental geometry sensing allows virtual objects to realistically interact and occlude with real surfaces and furniture.\n* Quick toggling between passthrough and VR makes it easy to switch modes and see your surroundings.\n\nHowever, issues remain with distortion around hands and objects in close proximity. And dynamic occlusion of real objects by virtual ones is not yet enabled. Some roughness, latency, and unnatural warping effects show it's still early days for consumer mixed reality. Viewing angles and depth are not yet fully lifelike. But most agree Meta has advanced well past competitors with the Quest 3's mixed reality capabilities, even if rough edges remain.\n\n## Software and Content\n\nThe software experience remains similar to Quest 2, with a few quality of life upgrades. The user interface design and navigation menus are largely unchanged. Backward compatibility ensures the entire 500+ Quest app library works out of the box.\n\n* 72Hz mode remains available despite some incorrect early reports of its removal. Experimental 120Hz support is added.\n* Automatic guardian setup streamlines getting started and makes re-calibration less frequent.\n* Mixed reality is enabled by default. The room scanning simplifies defining playable spaces.\n\nHowever, reviewers noted a lack of showpiece titles that demonstrate the Quest 3's upgraded performance at launch. Most current games are still built for Quest 2-level hardware. Meta promises over 100 titles with Quest 3 enhancements coming by end of 2023, but only a handful were available for testing.\n\nThe company is bullish on mixed reality being a strong pillar of the Quest 3's value, but most launch apps use it simplistically as environmental dressing rather than core mechanics. The potential of mixed reality gameplay remains largely theoretical for now until developers tap into the headset's capabilities.\n\n## PC VR Streaming\n\nStreaming PC VR content from gaming PCs to the Quest via Oculus Link or Air Link works reliably on the Quest 3, with visual quality benefiting from the headset's display and lens improvements. Wireless Air Link streaming saw minor compression artifacts for some depending on network conditions, while Link provided near-native fidelity.\n\nThird party app Virtual Desktop received an update to support the Quest 3's decoding capabilities. Early reports indicate smoother performance and higher streaming bitrates are achievable for a sharper wired\\/wireless PC VR experience.\n\n## Accessories and Value\n\nThe $499 starting price makes the Quest 3 a significant jump up from the $299 Quest 2's launch cost. The 512GB model is $650. Meta is offering packages with some accessories and free games to enhance value.\n\n* All launch orders include a $60 copy of Asgard's Wrath 2 (ships December 2023)\n* 512GB purchases add a 6-month Quest Plus subscription granting 2 free monthly games ($120 value)\n\nA carrying case ($70), Elite head strap ($70),charging dock ($130), and other first party accessories ship alongside the headset. There is a wider selection of third party Quest 3 accessories from brands like VR Cover and AMVR spanning comfort mods, lens inserts, controller grips, and more.\n\nAt $500, most reviewers consider the Quest 3 a good value and justifiable upgrade over prior models given the generational hardware leap. But it loses some of the Quest 2's appeal as an immediately affordable mainstream VR headset. Those seeking a more economical path into VR may still prefer the Quest 2, especially as Meta continues supporting it for now.\n\n## Consensus and Outlook\n\nThe Quest 3 delivers significant improvements across the board that make it the most technically powerful and advanced standalone VR headset available today. Meta appears to have combined the best parts of the Quest 2 and premium Quest Pro into an appealing middle ground option, boasting upgrades like the pancake lenses, mixed reality potential, processing bump, and streamlined ergonomics.\n\nReviewers agree it represents a milestone for consumer VR, pushing the limits of what's possible on a standalone device. But its full value is yet to be seen until more software catches up. Those seeking the very best graphics and unrestricted VR gameplay may still be better served by a PC-based setup, while cost-conscious users can opt for the prior-gen Quest 2.\n\nAssuming Meta executes well on its promised slate of MR-enabled social and gaming features throughout 2023-2024, the Quest 3 looks poised to take consumer virtual reality into an exciting new generation once the content offerings can properly take advantage of its capabilities. For now, it appears Meta has delivered their most technically impressive headset yet, even if it will take time for developers and designers to unlock its complete potential. But the future looks bright.",

The adjustable range is also wider at 58\\u201375 mm.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Setup is streamlined, now able to scan the user&amp;#39;s environment and automatically generate guardian boundaries for room-scale VR.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, some issues remain regarding long-term comfort. The front-heavy weight distribution still causes forehead pressure for some users. Meta&amp;#39;s Elite Strap upgrades are recommended, but add $70-130 to the cost. The facial interface lacks a light-blocking nose flap, allowing some peripheral light bleed. Fogging can still be an issue initially until the lenses warm up. Third party alternatives may provide better solutions.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Displays and Optics&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 utilizes dual LCD displays at 2064 \\u00d7 2208 pixels per eye, a 30% increase over the Quest 2&amp;#39;s 1832 x 1920 resolution. The pixel density hits 25 PPD, surpassing all prior Quest headsets. The new pancake lenses provide a wide, consistent sweet spot and reduced glare.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Image clarity and sharpness see a noticeable improvement, especially for text. Screen door effect is virtually eliminated.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Field of view receives a minor boost to 110\\u00b0 horizontal and 96\\u00b0 vertical. The expanded sweet spot makes the FOV increase more perceivable.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Visuals remain crisp across the entire lens area. No more &amp;quot;looking through a porthole&amp;quot; effect or having to find the center sweet spot.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;God rays and flare are significantly reduced compared to fresnel lenses. Some minor glare may still be visible at high contrasts.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lack of OLED displays means contrast and black levels are still more grayish than competitors like the PSVR 2. But most reviewers considered the Quest 3&amp;#39;s visuals the best of any standalone headset under $1000. It closes much of the gap with tethered headsets.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Hardware and Performance&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 introduces the new Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor. Meta quotes the chipset providing a 2.5x graphics performance uplift over Quest 2&amp;#39;s XR2 Gen 1.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The CPU receives a modest 33% boost, but the GPU power doubles. This translates to significantly higher rendering capabilities and smoother frame rates in VR.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loading times can be 10-30% faster. Some games see major visual upgrades with higher resolution textures, better shadows and lighting, and increased environmental detail.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handling of complex scenes with lots of characters or physics improves noticeably.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 8GB RAM adds a bit more headroom vs the Quest 2&amp;#39;s 6GB. However, some felt 12GB would have better matched the Quest Pro and prepared for future growth. The 5060 mAh battery lasts around 2-3 hours on a charge, similar to the Quest 2. It takes about 2.5 hours to recharge fully with the included 18W charger. Faster charging would have been nice given the added power draw.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Controllers and Tracking&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meta&amp;#39;s redesigned Touch Plus controllers drop the large tracking rings. This slims them down and improves ergonomics. The controllers use infrared LEDs for 6DOF tracking by the headset&amp;#39;s cameras, aided by computer vision algorithms and hand tracking data.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Despite fewer LEDs, most reviewers found the tracking accuracy and speed equal or superior to the Quest 2 Touch controllers. Blind spots can occur when controllers are moved behind the head.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The streamlined design enables more natural hand postures without worrying about bashing the rings together.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;New haptics via voice coil actuators provide improved feedback nuance and realism.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Battery life remains similar to Quest 2, lasting months on easily swappable AA batteries.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hand tracking receives some latency and performance improvements, but still has limitations in tracking range and accuracy vs controllers. It enables basic menu navigation, but most find controllers preferable for interactivity.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Audio and Microphone&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Integrated speakers in the headband provide simulated spatial audio. Volume output sees a noticeable boost over Quest 2 with richer bass, rated at 40% louder maximum levels. Microphone quality remains similar to prior Quest mics, suitable for social chat but not particularly impressive. The 3.5mm jack allows use of headphones or earbuds for private listening.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Mixed Reality &amp;amp; Passthrough&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mixed reality and full color passthrough represent the Quest 3&amp;#39;s biggest technical leap past its predecessors. Dual RGB cameras plus a depth sensor facilitate blending of real-world visuals with VR overlays.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Passthrough visual quality is heavily dependent on lighting conditions. Well-lit rooms provide a reasonably clear view where flat screens and handheld devices can be legible. Dim conditions introduce more noise.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The color accuracy and clarity surpasses the Quest Pro&amp;#39;s passthrough by a wide margin, despite the latter&amp;#39;s higher resolution.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Environmental geometry sensing allows virtual objects to realistically interact and occlude with real surfaces and furniture.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quick toggling between passthrough and VR makes it easy to switch modes and see your surroundings.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, issues remain with distortion around hands and objects in close proximity. And dynamic occlusion of real objects by virtual ones is not yet enabled. Some roughness, latency, and unnatural warping effects show it&amp;#39;s still early days for consumer mixed reality. Viewing angles and depth are not yet fully lifelike. But most agree Meta has advanced well past competitors with the Quest 3&amp;#39;s mixed reality capabilities, even if rough edges remain.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Software and Content&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The software experience remains similar to Quest 2, with a few quality of life upgrades. The user interface design and navigation menus are largely unchanged. Backward compatibility ensures the entire 500+ Quest app library works out of the box.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;72Hz mode remains available despite some incorrect early reports of its removal. Experimental 120Hz support is added.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Automatic guardian setup streamlines getting started and makes re-calibration less frequent.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mixed reality is enabled by default. The room scanning simplifies defining playable spaces.&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, reviewers noted a lack of showpiece titles that demonstrate the Quest 3&amp;#39;s upgraded performance at launch. Most current games are still built for Quest 2-level hardware. Meta promises over 100 titles with Quest 3 enhancements coming by end of 2023, but only a handful were available for testing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company is bullish on mixed reality being a strong pillar of the Quest 3&amp;#39;s value, but most launch apps use it simplistically as environmental dressing rather than core mechanics. The potential of mixed reality gameplay remains largely theoretical for now until developers tap into the headset&amp;#39;s capabilities.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;PC VR Streaming&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Streaming PC VR content from gaming PCs to the Quest via Oculus Link or Air Link works reliably on the Quest 3, with visual quality benefiting from the headset&amp;#39;s display and lens improvements. Wireless Air Link streaming saw minor compression artifacts for some depending on network conditions, while Link provided near-native fidelity.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third party app Virtual Desktop received an update to support the Quest 3&amp;#39;s decoding capabilities. Early reports indicate smoother performance and higher streaming bitrates are achievable for a sharper wired\\/wireless PC VR experience.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Accessories and Value&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The $499 starting price makes the Quest 3 a significant jump up from the $299 Quest 2&amp;#39;s launch cost. The 512GB model is $650. Meta is offering packages with some accessories and free games to enhance value.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;All launch orders include a $60 copy of Asgard&amp;#39;s Wrath 2 (ships December 2023)&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;512GB purchases add a 6-month Quest Plus subscription granting 2 free monthly games ($120 value)&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A carrying case ($70), Elite head strap ($70),charging dock ($130), and other first party accessories ship alongside the headset. There is a wider selection of third party Quest 3 accessories from brands like VR Cover and AMVR spanning comfort mods, lens inserts, controller grips, and more.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At $500, most reviewers consider the Quest 3 a good value and justifiable upgrade over prior models given the generational hardware leap. But it loses some of the Quest 2&amp;#39;s appeal as an immediately affordable mainstream VR headset. Those seeking a more economical path into VR may still prefer the Quest 2, especially as Meta continues supporting it for now.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Consensus and Outlook&lt;\\/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Quest 3 delivers significant improvements across the board that make it the most technically powerful and advanced standalone VR headset available today. Meta appears to have combined the best parts of the Quest 2 and premium Quest Pro into an appealing middle ground option, boasting upgrades like the pancake lenses, mixed reality potential, processing bump, and streamlined ergonomics.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reviewers agree it represents a milestone for consumer VR, pushing the limits of what&amp;#39;s possible on a standalone device. But its full value is yet to be seen until more software catches up. Those seeking the very best graphics and unrestricted VR gameplay may still be better served by a PC-based setup, while cost-conscious users can opt for the prior-gen Quest 2.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Assuming Meta executes well on its promised slate of MR-enabled social and gaming features throughout 2023-2024, the Quest 3 looks poised to take consumer virtual reality into an exciting new generation once the content offerings can properly take advantage of its capabilities. For now, it appears Meta has delivered their most technically impressive headset yet, even if it will take time for developers and designers to unlock its complete potential. But the future looks bright.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Many thanks to everyone that helped with testing, fixing and counseling (Helifax, DarkStarSword, Schwing, Kaimasta, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2023-02-11): added geo-11 fix. Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence configured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, fixed lens flares, stereoized specular reflections better, optimized regexes, improved a part of screen space reflections, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2020-04-26): added the \"6\" hotkey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2019-12-21): fixed volumetric lighting and an extra effect related to that. Also an approximate fix to fog that comes with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2019-03-27): fix updated with 3Dmigoto 1.3.16. Better performance for regex (better loading times of shaders fixed by regex after the first time).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE (2019-03-24): I have updated the fix with a profile setting that avoids crashes. Thank you, Kaimasta, for that setting. Everyone, update your fix!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFixed\n\n\\- Shadows.\n\n\\- Lighting.\n\n\\- Specular reflections.\n\n\\- Screen space reflections.\n\n\\- Skybox.\n\n\\- Dynamic HUD with three settings.\n\n\\- Blood and similar effects.\n\n\\- Haloing.\n\n\\- Lighting clipping for the most part.\n\n\\- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.\n\n\\- Temporal anti-aliasing.\n\n\\- Interlaced mode.\n\n\\- Motion blur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnown issues\n\n\\- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.\n\n\\- The main and options menu at the title screen has some clipping. Reduce convergence there to see the text.\n\n\\- Some remaining lighting (non volumetric) clipping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstallation\n\n\\- geo-11: download this file and extract its contents in the \"RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard\" folder, where \"re7.exe\" is. Remember to edit \"d3dxdm.ini\" to change your \"direct\\_mode\" to the output you need. It's sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, \"direct\\_mode = Geo-11\\_dx11\" works in fullscreen, but \"Geo-11\\_dx9\" doesn't work.\n\n\\- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don't use): download this file and extract its contents in the \"RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard\" folder, where \"re7.exe\" is.\n\n\\- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the \"dx11\\_non-rt\" Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.\n\n\\- Launch the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHotkeys\n\n\\- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.\n\n\\- F2 (not for the geo-11 fix): HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled.\n\n\\- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F4: SMAA toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F5: barrel distortion toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- F6: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- . (period): dynamic HUD presets (for crosshairs and interaction icons). By default all HUD elements have dynamic depth, and crosshairs have centered depth. Press once to disable dynamic HUD. Press twice to make the HUD have centered depth. Press three times to go back to default.\n\n\\- 6 (not the numpad): VHS dark circle overlay toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the \"F1\" hotkey for static presets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutoconvergence instructions\n\n\\- Enabled by default, they can be disabled by pressing the \"0\" key (not from the numpad).\n\n\\- Apart from the 0 hotkey, you can set \"dm\\_auto\\_convergence = 0\" in \"d3dxdm.ini\" to disable it by default.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [masterotakusuko@gmail.com](mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com)\n\nOr you can join my XXXX: [https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku](https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVorpx FullVR + 4K\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/hooking-problem-with-resident-evil-7-and-resident-evil-2-remake\\/](https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/hooking-problem-with-resident-evil-7-and-resident-evil-2-remake\\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Many thanks to everyone that helped with testing, fixing and counseling (Helifax, DarkStarSword, Schwing, Kaimasta, etc).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2023-02-11): added geo-11 fix. Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence configured.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, fixed lens flares, stereoized specular reflections better, optimized regexes, improved a part of screen space reflections, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2020-04-26): added the &amp;quot;6&amp;quot; hotkey.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2019-12-21): fixed volumetric lighting and an extra effect related to that. Also an approximate fix to fog that comes with it.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2019-03-27): fix updated with 3Dmigoto 1.3.16. Better performance for regex (better loading times of shaders fixed by regex after the first time).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UPDATE (2019-03-24): I have updated the fix with a profile setting that avoids crashes. Thank you, Kaimasta, for that setting. Everyone, update your fix!!!!&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Shadows.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Specular reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Screen space reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Skybox.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Dynamic HUD with three settings.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Blood and similar effects.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Haloing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting clipping for the most part.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Temporal anti-aliasing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Interlaced mode.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Motion blur.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Known issues&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The main and options menu at the title screen has some clipping. Reduce convergence there to see the text.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Some remaining lighting (non volumetric) clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- geo-11: download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re7.exe&amp;quot; is. Remember to edit &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to change your &amp;quot;direct_mode&amp;quot; to the output you need. It&amp;#39;s sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, &amp;quot;direct_mode = Geo-11_dx11&amp;quot; works in fullscreen, but &amp;quot;Geo-11_dx9&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don&amp;#39;t use): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RESIDENT EVIL 7 biohazard&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re7.exe&amp;quot; is.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the &amp;quot;dx11_non-rt&amp;quot; Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Launch the game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotkeys&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F2 (not for the geo-11 fix): HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F4: SMAA toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F5: barrel distortion toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F6: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- . (period): dynamic HUD presets (for crosshairs and interaction icons). By default all HUD elements have dynamic depth, and crosshairs have centered depth. Press once to disable dynamic HUD. Press twice to make the HUD have centered depth. Press three times to go back to default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 6 (not the numpad): VHS dark circle overlay toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the &amp;quot;F1&amp;quot; hotkey for static presets.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Autoconvergence instructions&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Enabled by default, they can be disabled by pressing the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; key (not from the numpad).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Apart from the 0 hotkey, you can set &amp;quot;dm_auto_convergence = 0&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to disable it by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can join my XXXX: &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorpx FullVR + 4K&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/hooking-problem-with-resident-evil-7-and-resident-evil-2-remake\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/hooking-problem-with-resident-evil-7-and-resident-evil-2-remake\\/&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download\"&gt;https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download&lt;\\/a&gt; Reshade with full Add-On Support, inclusive the complete Effect Package Depth3D BlueSkyDefender&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/2.In\"&gt;2.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu activate SuperDepth3D_VR, follow instructions (Home-Key on keyboard for Menu)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/3.Download\"&gt;3.Download&lt;\\/a&gt; [&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/&lt;\\/a&gt; Generic_Depth_Mod.Addon64], copy it next to your Game.exe&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/4.In\"&gt;4.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu install generic_depth_mod.addon64 (Add-On Tab)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch Side by Side 3D on your 3D Compatible TV\\/Monitor + 3D Glasses or Install Vorpx Desktop Viewer &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com&lt;\\/a&gt; or Depth3D VR Companion App &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt; &lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence replaced with the one done by geo-11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, added more sharpening presets, fixed lens flares, improved radial blur, stereoized more specular reflections, optimized regexes, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2020-05-07): fix updated with one small fix to the first mirror cutscene at the beginning, and this update also adds automatic convergence thanks to DJ-RK, which is enabled by default. Also some improvements to dynamic HUD, including making subtitles unaffected by it (they can be controlled by the static HUD depth presets).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFixed\n\n\\- Shadows.\n\n\\- Lighting.\n\n\\- Particles (rain, sparks, smoke, etc).\n\n\\- Specular reflections.\n\n\\- Screen space reflections.\n\n\\- The only mirror in the game.\n\n\\- Skybox.\n\n\\- Dynamic HUD with three settings.\n\n\\- Blood and similar effects.\n\n\\- Lighting clipping.\n\n\\- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.\n\n\\- Temporal anti-aliasing.\n\n\\- Interlaced mode.\n\n\\- Motion blur.\n\n\\- Autoconvergence configured. When not using it, automatic low convergence for cutscenes can be used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnown issues\n\n\\- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstallation\n\n\\- geo-11 (with build v0.6.109): download this file and extract its contents in the \"RE3\" folder, where \"re3.exe\" is. Remember to edit \"d3dxdm.ini\" to change your \"direct\\_mode\" to the output you need. It's sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, \"direct\\_mode = Geo-11\\_dx11\" works in fullscreen, but \"Geo-11\\_dx9\" doesn't work.\n\n\\- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don't use): download this file and extract its contents in the \"RE3\" folder, where \"re3.exe\" is (Resident Evil 3), or the \"RESIDENT EVIL RESISTANCE\" folder, where \"REResistance.exe\" is (Resident Evil Resistance).\n\n\\- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the \"dx11\\_non-rt\" Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.\n\n\\- IMPORTANT: choose DirectX 11 ingame or set \"TargetPlatform=DirectX11\" in \"re3\\_config.ini\". Don't use DirectX 12.\n\n\\- Launch the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes\n\n\\- For screen space reflections to be perfect, your internal resolution can't be lower than 60% of your output resolution. That means that you shouldn't use a render scale of 50% nor a bit higher scale combined with interlacing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutoconvergence instructions\n\n\\- Enabled by default, it can be disabled by pressing the \"0\" key (not from the numpad).\n\n\\- If you do not wish to use this new dynamic autoconvergence, and would rather use the old style (that uses presets to set the convergence statically to low during cutscene, and higher during gameplay) you can do so by first disabling autoconvergence, and then enabling (if it's disabled) the scene based convergence presets via pressing \"9\" (not from the numpad).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHotkeys\n\n\\- ctrl+shift+H: this displays help text with the hotkeys.\n\n\\- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.\n\n\\- F2: HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled or for menus and other static elements.\n\n\\- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F4: image sharpening presets (disabled, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%). Disabled by default. This hotkey doesn't work when using FidelityFX CAS + Upscaling.\n\n\\- F5: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- F6: depth of field toggle. Not disabled by default. There is an option ingame, but DoF is necessary to trigger the low convergence preset when not using convergence. With this hotkey, you can have that and also disable DoF in real time.\n\n\\- . (period): dynamic HUD presets. By default all HUD elements have dynamic depth. Press once to disable it, making the static HUD presets take preference. Press twice to make all elements get the depth of the center. Press three times to go back to default.\n\n\\- F11: something about Geo-11 Surround. Ask Helifax on the forums. Hotkey most probably not working in this fix.\n\n\\- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the \"F1\" hotkey for static presets.\n\n\\- 9 (not the numpad): this toggles on the old cutscene detection that triggers a low convergence preset. Enabled by default.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [masterotakusuko@gmail.com](mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com)\n\nOr you can join my XXXX: [https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku](https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVorpx FullVR + 4K\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-3-remake\\/](https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-3-remake\\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence replaced with the one done by geo-11.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, added more sharpening presets, fixed lens flares, improved radial blur, stereoized more specular reflections, optimized regexes, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2020-05-07): fix updated with one small fix to the first mirror cutscene at the beginning, and this update also adds automatic convergence thanks to DJ-RK, which is enabled by default. Also some improvements to dynamic HUD, including making subtitles unaffected by it (they can be controlled by the static HUD depth presets).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Shadows.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Particles (rain, sparks, smoke, etc).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Specular reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Screen space reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- The only mirror in the game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Skybox.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Dynamic HUD with three settings.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Blood and similar effects.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Temporal anti-aliasing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Interlaced mode.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Motion blur.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Autoconvergence configured. When not using it, automatic low convergence for cutscenes can be used.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Known issues&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- geo-11 (with build v0.6.109): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RE3&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re3.exe&amp;quot; is. Remember to edit &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to change your &amp;quot;direct_mode&amp;quot; to the output you need. It&amp;#39;s sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, &amp;quot;direct_mode = Geo-11_dx11&amp;quot; works in fullscreen, but &amp;quot;Geo-11_dx9&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don&amp;#39;t use): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RE3&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re3.exe&amp;quot; is (Resident Evil 3), or the &amp;quot;RESIDENT EVIL RESISTANCE&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;REResistance.exe&amp;quot; is (Resident Evil Resistance).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the &amp;quot;dx11_non-rt&amp;quot; Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPORTANT: choose DirectX 11 ingame or set &amp;quot;TargetPlatform=DirectX11&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;re3_config.ini&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t use DirectX 12.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Launch the game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- For screen space reflections to be perfect, your internal resolution can&amp;#39;t be lower than 60% of your output resolution. That means that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use a render scale of 50% nor a bit higher scale combined with interlacing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Autoconvergence instructions&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Enabled by default, it can be disabled by pressing the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; key (not from the numpad).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- If you do not wish to use this new dynamic autoconvergence, and would rather use the old style (that uses presets to set the convergence statically to low during cutscene, and higher during gameplay) you can do so by first disabling autoconvergence, and then enabling (if it&amp;#39;s disabled) the scene based convergence presets via pressing &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; (not from the numpad).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotkeys&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- ctrl+shift+H: this displays help text with the hotkeys.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F2: HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled or for menus and other static elements.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F4: image sharpening presets (disabled, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%). Disabled by default. This hotkey doesn&amp;#39;t work when using FidelityFX CAS + Upscaling.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F5: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F6: depth of field toggle. Not disabled by default. There is an option ingame, but DoF is necessary to trigger the low convergence preset when not using convergence. With this hotkey, you can have that and also disable DoF in real time.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- . (period): dynamic HUD presets. By default all HUD elements have dynamic depth. Press once to disable it, making the static HUD presets take preference. Press twice to make all elements get the depth of the center. Press three times to go back to default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F11: something about Geo-11 Surround. Ask Helifax on the forums. Hotkey most probably not working in this fix.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the &amp;quot;F1&amp;quot; hotkey for static presets.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 9 (not the numpad): this toggles on the old cutscene detection that triggers a low convergence preset. Enabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can join my XXXX: &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorpx FullVR + 4K&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-3-remake\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-3-remake\\/&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download\"&gt;https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download&lt;\\/a&gt; Reshade with full Add-On Support, inclusive the complete Effect Package Depth3D BlueSkyDefender&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/2.In\"&gt;2.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu activate SuperDepth3D_VR, follow instructions (Home-Key on keyboard for Menu)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/3.Download\"&gt;3.Download&lt;\\/a&gt; [&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/&lt;\\/a&gt; Generic_Depth_Mod.Addon64], copy it next to your Game.exe&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/4.In\"&gt;4.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu install generic_depth_mod.addon64 (Add-On Tab)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch Side by Side 3D on your 3D Compatible TV\\/Monitor + 3D Glasses or Install Vorpx Desktop Viewer &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com&lt;\\/a&gt; or Depth3D VR Companion App &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt; &lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Many thanks to everyone that helped with testing, fixing and counseling (Helifax, DarkStarSword, Schwing, Kaimasta, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2023-02-02): added geo-11 fix. Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence replaced with the one done by geo-11.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, added more sharpening presets, fixed lens flares, improved radial blur, stereoized more specular reflections, optimized regexes, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting. Implemented autoconvergence using the same method DJ-RK used for RE3.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2019-12-21): fixed volumetric lighting. Flashlight cone lighting is at full depth to avoid some problems. Some glass now has realistic depth for reflections.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIncredibly small update (2019-03-30): changed one regex to catch a shader that appears if you use \"UseOptimizeShader=Disable\", which you don't need to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmall update (2019-03-29): regexes changed in a way to avoid possible conflicts. If shadows were perfect for you, you may not need this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVERY IMPORTANT UPDATE (2019-03-27): it's important to redownload the fix. With the 3Dmigoto 1.3.16 version, this update fixes stability issues, convergence issues, lets you use \"UseVendorExtention=Enable\" and also let me fix all particles in the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFixed\n\n\\- Shadows.\n\n\\- Lighting.\n\n\\- Particles (rain, sparks, smoke, etc).\n\n\\- Specular reflections.\n\n\\- Screen space reflections.\n\n\\- Mirrors.\n\n\\- Skybox.\n\n\\- Dynamic HUD with three settings.\n\n\\- Blood and similar effects.\n\n\\- Lighting clipping.\n\n\\- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.\n\n\\- Temporal anti-aliasing.\n\n\\- Interlaced mode.\n\n\\- Motion blur.\n\n\\- Autoconvergence configured. When not using it, automatic low convergence for cutscenes can be used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKnown issues\n\n\\- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstallation\n\n\\- geo-11 (with build v0.6.109): download this file and extract its contents in the \"RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2\" folder, where \"re2.exe\" is. Remember to edit \"d3dxdm.ini\" to change your \"direct\\_mode\" to the output you need. It's sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, \"direct\\_mode = Geo-11\\_dx11\" works in fullscreen, but \"Geo-11\\_dx9\" doesn't work.\n\n\\- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don't use): download this file and extract its contents in the \"RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2\" folder, where \"re2.exe\" is.\n\n\\- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the \"dx11\\_non-rt\" Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.\n\n\\- IMPORTANT: in the game folder, open \"re2\\_config.ini\" and set \"TargetPlatform=DirectX11\", or just choose DirectX 11 ingame.\n\n\\- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes\n\n\\- For screen space reflections to be perfect, your internal resolution can't be lower than 60% of your output resolution. That means that you shouldn't use a render scale of 50% nor a bit higher scale combined with interlacing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAutoconvergence instructions\n\n\\-Enabled by default, they can be disabled by pressing the \"0\" key (not from the numpad) or the two stick buttons at the same time.\n\n\\- Do not use interlaced mode. It makes autoconvergence not work. Also don't use \"uncommon\" resolutions and aspect ratios lower than 16:9.\n\n\\-Do not try adjusting the convergence via the Geo-11 convergence + or - keys with autoconvergence enabled. Doing so will lock the convergence either REALLY high or really low. If you encounter this, easiest solution is to press CTRL + ALT + F10 to reset the saved user settings. This only happened with the old autoconvergence.\n\n\\-If you do not wish to use autoconvergence, and insted you want to use the old style (that uses presets to set the convergence statically to low during cutscene, and higher during gameplay) you can do so by first disabling autoconvergence, and then making sure the scene based convergence presets via pressing \"9\" (not from the numpad) is enabled (it is by default). You'll need to make a convergence change (unless it's a cutscene) if you're using TAA or motion blur after you disable autoconvergence, for things to be clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHotkeys\n\n\\- ctrl+shift+H: this displays help text with the hotkeys.\n\n\\- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.\n\n\\- F2: HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled or for menus and other static elements.\n\n\\- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F4: image sharpening presets (0%, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%). 0% by default.\n\n\\- F5: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- . (period): dynamic HUD presets. By default all HUD takes the calculated depth of the center of the screen. Press once so each vertex has its own depth. Press twice to make the HUD static. Press three times to go back to default.\n\n\\- F11: something about Geo-11 Surround. Ask Helifax on the forums.\n\n\\- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the \"F1\" hotkey for static presets.\n\n\\- 9 (not the numpad): this toggles on the old cutscene detection that triggers a low convergence preset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [masterotakusuko@gmail.com](mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com)\n\nOr you can join my XXXX: [https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku](https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVorpx FullVR + 4K\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-2-remake\\/page\\/5\\/](https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-2-remake\\/page\\/5\\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

Many thanks to everyone that helped with testing, fixing and counseling (Helifax, DarkStarSword, Schwing, Kaimasta, etc).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2023-02-02): added geo-11 fix. Fixed TAA (including the temporal part of reflections), motion blur and interlaced mode in a more proper way. Fixed volumetric lighting clipping. Configured autoconvergence. HUD adjustments. Fixed a lot of other minor problems. Stereoized vignette (if you enable the effect). Autoconvergence replaced with the one done by geo-11.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2022-01-11): fixed TAA and interlaced mode, added more sharpening presets, fixed lens flares, improved radial blur, stereoized more specular reflections, optimized regexes, and fixed some fog related to volumetric lighting. Implemented autoconvergence using the same method DJ-RK used for RE3.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2019-12-21): fixed volumetric lighting. Flashlight cone lighting is at full depth to avoid some problems. Some glass now has realistic depth for reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Incredibly small update (2019-03-30): changed one regex to catch a shader that appears if you use &amp;quot;UseOptimizeShader=Disable&amp;quot;, which you don&amp;#39;t need to.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small update (2019-03-29): regexes changed in a way to avoid possible conflicts. If shadows were perfect for you, you may not need this.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VERY IMPORTANT UPDATE (2019-03-27): it&amp;#39;s important to redownload the fix. With the 3Dmigoto 1.3.16 version, this update fixes stability issues, convergence issues, lets you use &amp;quot;UseVendorExtention=Enable&amp;quot; and also let me fix all particles in the game.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Shadows.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Particles (rain, sparks, smoke, etc).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Specular reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Screen space reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Mirrors.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Skybox.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Dynamic HUD with three settings.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Blood and similar effects.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Lighting clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Volumetric lighting and its clipping.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Temporal anti-aliasing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Interlaced mode.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Motion blur.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Autoconvergence configured. When not using it, automatic low convergence for cutscenes can be used.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Known issues&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- With the geo-11 fix, HBAO+ is currently broken. Use any other ambient occlusion setting instead.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- geo-11 (with build v0.6.109): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re2.exe&amp;quot; is. Remember to edit &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to change your &amp;quot;direct_mode&amp;quot; to the output you need. It&amp;#39;s sbs by default. For Geo-11 monitors, &amp;quot;direct_mode = Geo-11_dx11&amp;quot; works in fullscreen, but &amp;quot;Geo-11_dx9&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- (Older fix for Geo-11. Don&amp;#39;t use): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;re2.exe&amp;quot; is.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPORTANT: you need to be on the &amp;quot;dx11_non-rt&amp;quot; Steam branch, to have DX11 as an option.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- IMPORTANT: in the game folder, open &amp;quot;re2_config.ini&amp;quot; and set &amp;quot;TargetPlatform=DirectX11&amp;quot;, or just choose DirectX 11 ingame.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notes&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- For screen space reflections to be perfect, your internal resolution can&amp;#39;t be lower than 60% of your output resolution. That means that you shouldn&amp;#39;t use a render scale of 50% nor a bit higher scale combined with interlacing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Autoconvergence instructions&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Enabled by default, they can be disabled by pressing the &amp;quot;0&amp;quot; key (not from the numpad) or the two stick buttons at the same time.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Do not use interlaced mode. It makes autoconvergence not work. Also don&amp;#39;t use &amp;quot;uncommon&amp;quot; resolutions and aspect ratios lower than 16:9.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Do not try adjusting the convergence via the Geo-11 convergence + or - keys with autoconvergence enabled. Doing so will lock the convergence either REALLY high or really low. If you encounter this, easiest solution is to press CTRL + ALT + F10 to reset the saved user settings. This only happened with the old autoconvergence.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-If you do not wish to use autoconvergence, and insted you want to use the old style (that uses presets to set the convergence statically to low during cutscene, and higher during gameplay) you can do so by first disabling autoconvergence, and then making sure the scene based convergence presets via pressing &amp;quot;9&amp;quot; (not from the numpad) is enabled (it is by default). You&amp;#39;ll need to make a convergence change (unless it&amp;#39;s a cutscene) if you&amp;#39;re using TAA or motion blur after you disable autoconvergence, for things to be clear.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotkeys&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- ctrl+shift+H: this displays help text with the hotkeys.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F1: convergence presets. They can only be used when you disable automatic convergence.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F2: HUD depth presets, when dynamic HUD is disabled or for menus and other static elements.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F4: image sharpening presets (0%, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%). 0% by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F5: vignette toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- . (period): dynamic HUD presets. By default all HUD takes the calculated depth of the center of the screen. Press once so each vertex has its own depth. Press twice to make the HUD static. Press three times to go back to default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F11: something about Geo-11 Surround. Ask Helifax on the forums.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 0 (not the numpad): this toggles automatic convergence off. Then you can use the &amp;quot;F1&amp;quot; hotkey for static presets.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 9 (not the numpad): this toggles on the old cutscene detection that triggers a low convergence preset.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can join my XXXX: &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorpx FullVR + 4K&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-2-remake\\/page\\/5\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/resident-evil-2-remake\\/page\\/5\\/&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download\"&gt;https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download&lt;\\/a&gt; Reshade with full Add-On Support, inclusive the complete Effect Package Depth3D BlueSkyDefender&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/2.In\"&gt;2.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu activate SuperDepth3D_VR, follow instructions (Home-Key on keyboard for Menu)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/3.Download\"&gt;3.Download&lt;\\/a&gt; [&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/&lt;\\/a&gt; Generic_Depth_Mod.Addon64], copy it next to your Game.exe&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/4.In\"&gt;4.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu install generic_depth_mod.addon64 (Add-On Tab)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch Side by Side 3D on your 3D Compatible TV\\/Monitor + 3D Glasses or Install Vorpx Desktop Viewer &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com&lt;\\/a&gt; or Depth3D VR Companion App &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt; &lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Radial blur fixed. Temporal effect of volumetric fog fixes. HUD tweaks. Autoconvergence configured and enabled by default.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2021-01-24): accurate fix for volumetric fog. Correct profile settings for some shadows problems. Perfect fix for haloing problems. Vignette toggle. Perfect parallax occlusion mapping. Fixed the screen borders of screen space reflections. Other minor things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2019-06-10): completely fixed shadows (including cutscenes and everything), decals, water, realistic specular reflections, and sun\\/moon lighting (you can check that by tilting the camera with Geo-11 Ansel). 3Dmigoto updated to 1.3.16. The screenshots above as of this date don't show this update.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate (2018-12-01): fixed screen space reflections (see third screenshot). To appreciate the effect better, remember to use the \"8\" hotkey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFixed\n\n\\- All haloing problems (smoke, water, refraction effects, etc).\n\n\\- Shadows, decals, and lighting.\n\n\\- Volumetric lighting and fog.\n\n\\- Clipping of lighting and decals.\n\n\\- Water reflections.\n\n\\- Light shafts.\n\n\\- Sun\\/moon lighting in the sky.\n\n\\- Screen space reflections.\n\n\\- Stereoized parallax occlusion mapping.\n\n\\- Some geometry that was double stereoized.\n\n\\- Radial blur.\n\n\\- Tweakable HUD depth and toggling. Crosshair is at more depth than the rest and isn't affected by the HUD depth hotkey.\n\n\\- Autoconvergence configured for slow transitions, with an automatic preset for cutscenes that changes how autoconvergence is configured (lower max limit and faster transitions). This preset also makes HUD be at screen depth for better subtitle readability, and also screen depth for the monster list and equipment in the world map, for safety measures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstallation\n\n\\- geo-11, with build v0.6.64: download this file and extract its contents in the \"Nioh\" folder, where \"nioh.exe\" is. Remember to edit \"d3dxdm.ini\" to change your \"direct\\_mode\" to the output you need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor Geo-11 monitors there are two ways to make it work, and these settings aren't enabled by default:\n\n1- \"direct\\_mode = Geo-11\\_dx11\" + \"upscaling = 1\" + \"swap\\_effect = 4\" + using borderless in the game options.\n\n2- \"direct\\_mode = Geo-11\\_dx9\" + \"upscaling = 1\" + using borderless in the game options. 2D videos won't play, mentioning an error at the top left corner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Geo-11 (old): download this file and extract its contents in the \"Nioh\" folder, where \"nioh.exe\" is.\n\n\\- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile (in the case of Geo-11).\n\n\\- Do not use 1366x768 resolution specifically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHotkeys\n\n\\- F1: convergence presets. Useless with autoconvergence, which is enabled by default.\n\n\\- F2: HUD depth presets. 40% depth in gameplay and 20% in cutscenes by default.\n\n\\- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F4: depth of field toggle (it only appears in cutscenes). Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F5: protagonist beard toggle when you use the default or long beard. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F6: it disables one compute shader in charge of some lighting spots (like shrines). Just in case you want to increase performance a bit. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- 5 (not the numpad): bloom toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- 6 (not the numpad): vignette toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- 8 (not the numpad): screen space reflections quality multiplier presets (2, 4, 8, 16, 0, 1). x1 by default. This doesn't control resolution. It increases the amount of geometry reflected. There is a performance cost when you increase this, but it isn't too bad. Examples: ssr x1, ssr x8.\n\n\\- 9 (not the numpad): SSAO toggle, in case you want to disable it without going to the settings menu. It can be useful for cutscenes, because it looks uglier and unfiltered there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPerformance mode (for the old Geo-11 fix, outdated)\n\nIf you need more GPU performance and you don't mind losing some accuracy, open \"d3dx.ini\", go to the line that says \"y10=0\" and change it to \"y10=1\". Then go near the bottom and change \"StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00005008\" to \"StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00000008\".\n\nThis will make volumetric effects worse (sticking to surfaces instead of floating in the air as they should) but you may see 15-20% GPU performance gains when those effects are used.\n\nPress the F6 hotkey to get even more performance when Kodama shrines are nearby (it disables their lighting).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [masterotakusuko@gmail.com](mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com)\n\nOr you can join my XXXX: [https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku](https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGeo-11 fix for Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition.\n\nUpdate (2022-10-11): geo-11 fix added, with build v0.6.64. Temporal effect of volumetric fog fixes. Fixed all other remaining shader problems and HUD text. HUD tweaks. Autoconvergence configured and enabled by default.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFixed\n\n\\- Haloing problems (smoke, water, refraction effects, etc).\n\n\\- Shadows, decals, and lighting.\n\n\\- Volumetric lighting and fog.\n\n\\- Clipping of lighting and decals.\n\n\\- Water reflections.\n\n\\- Skyboxes, sun and moon.\n\n\\- Screen space reflections.\n\n\\- World map.\n\n\\- Some geometry that was double stereoized.\n\n\\- Distortion effect.\n\n\\- Tweakable HUD depth and toggling. Crosshair is at more depth than the rest and isn't affected by the HUD depth hotkey.\n\n\\- Autoconvergence configured for slow transitions, with an automatic preset for cutscenes that changes how autoconvergence is configured (lower max limit and faster transitions). This preset also makes HUD be at screen depth for better subtitle readability. Also another preset that makes world map convergence be higher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nInstallation\n\n\\- geo-11, with build v0.6.64: download this file and extract its contents in the \"Nioh2\" folder, where \"nioh2.exe\" is. Remember to edit \"d3dxdm.ini\" to change your \"direct\\_mode\" to the output you need. For Geo-11 monitors, use \"Geo-11\\_dx11\" and preferably set \"upscaling = 1\" in \"d3dxdm.ini\". The \"Geo-11\\_dx9\" mode doesn't work currently.\n\n\\- (Geo-11 fix, outdated): download this file and extract its contents in the \"Nioh2\" folder, where \"nioh2.exe\" is.\n\n\\- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile.\n\n\\- Do not use 1366x768 resolution specifically.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecommendations\n\n\\- (Geo-11, old) Never disable 3D or alt+tab while playing unless you are in Geo-11 Ansel mode (paused game in photo mode). Doing that will make trees and grass desynchronize between the eyes.\n\n\\- Don't use the ingame 120fps cap. It will make anything under 60fps run at lower speed than normal. Better use the 60fps cap.\n\n\\- You can use borderless fullscreen and it will still trigger Geo-11. Just like exclusive fullscreen, but more alt+tab friendly (if you remember to use Ansel before doing that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHotkeys\n\n\\- F1: convergence presets (0, 1, 40, 80, 160, 240, 320). 320 by default. However, there are two or three missions that incorrectly trigger the low convergence preset because the depth of field shader is present. These presets don't do anything when using autoconvergence (enabled by default).\n\n\\- F2: HUD depth presets. 40% depth by default.\n\n\\- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- F4: depth of field toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- 5 (not the numpad): bloom toggle. Not disabled by default.\n\n\\- 6 (not the numpad): vignette toggle. Disabled by default. A second press also disables radial blur in the dark realm. The third press turns all vignette and radial blur on again.\n\n\\- 7 (not the numpad): FXAA toggle. Disabled by default.\n\n\\- 8 (not the numpad): screen space reflections quality toggle. Unmodified by default. This doesn't control resolution. It increases the amount of geometry reflected. There is a performance cost when you use this, maybe 15-20% extra GPU usage.\n\n\\- XB\\_LEFT\\_TRIGGER (holding it): this increases HUD depth to 85% when you hold it, intended for aiming with long range weapons. Not needed anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [masterotakusuko@gmail.com](mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com)\n\nOr you can join my XXXX: [https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku](https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVorpx G3D FullVR 4K\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/niohcomplete-edition\\/](https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/niohcomplete-edition\\/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nor:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D](https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

This preset also makes HUD be at screen depth for better subtitle readability, and also screen depth for the monster list and equipment in the world map, for safety measures.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- geo-11, with build v0.6.64: download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;Nioh&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;nioh.exe&amp;quot; is. Remember to edit &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to change your &amp;quot;direct_mode&amp;quot; to the output you need.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Geo-11 monitors there are two ways to make it work, and these settings aren&amp;#39;t enabled by default:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1- &amp;quot;direct_mode = Geo-11_dx11&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;upscaling = 1&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;swap_effect = 4&amp;quot; + using borderless in the game options.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2- &amp;quot;direct_mode = Geo-11_dx9&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;upscaling = 1&amp;quot; + using borderless in the game options. 2D videos won&amp;#39;t play, mentioning an error at the top left corner.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Geo-11 (old): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;Nioh&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;nioh.exe&amp;quot; is.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile (in the case of Geo-11).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Do not use 1366x768 resolution specifically.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotkeys&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F1: convergence presets. Useless with autoconvergence, which is enabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F2: HUD depth presets. 40% depth in gameplay and 20% in cutscenes by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F4: depth of field toggle (it only appears in cutscenes). Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F5: protagonist beard toggle when you use the default or long beard. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F6: it disables one compute shader in charge of some lighting spots (like shrines). Just in case you want to increase performance a bit. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 5 (not the numpad): bloom toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 6 (not the numpad): vignette toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 8 (not the numpad): screen space reflections quality multiplier presets (2, 4, 8, 16, 0, 1). x1 by default. This doesn&amp;#39;t control resolution. It increases the amount of geometry reflected. There is a performance cost when you increase this, but it isn&amp;#39;t too bad. Examples: ssr x1, ssr x8.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 9 (not the numpad): SSAO toggle, in case you want to disable it without going to the settings menu. It can be useful for cutscenes, because it looks uglier and unfiltered there.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Performance mode (for the old Geo-11 fix, outdated)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need more GPU performance and you don&amp;#39;t mind losing some accuracy, open &amp;quot;d3dx.ini&amp;quot;, go to the line that says &amp;quot;y10=0&amp;quot; and change it to &amp;quot;y10=1&amp;quot;. Then go near the bottom and change &amp;quot;StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00005008&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;StereoFlagsDX10 = 0x00000008&amp;quot;.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will make volumetric effects worse (sticking to surfaces instead of floating in the air as they should) but you may see 15-20% GPU performance gains when those effects are used.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Press the F6 hotkey to get even more performance when Kodama shrines are nearby (it disables their lighting).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can join my XXXX: &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Geo-11 fix for Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Update (2022-10-11): geo-11 fix added, with build v0.6.64. Temporal effect of volumetric fog fixes. Fixed all other remaining shader problems and HUD text. HUD tweaks. Autoconvergence configured and enabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fixed&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Haloing problems (smoke, water, refraction effects, etc).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Shadows, decals, and lighting.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Volumetric lighting and fog.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Clipping of lighting and decals.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Water reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Skyboxes, sun and moon.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Screen space reflections.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- World map.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Some geometry that was double stereoized.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Distortion effect.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Tweakable HUD depth and toggling. Crosshair is at more depth than the rest and isn&amp;#39;t affected by the HUD depth hotkey.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Autoconvergence configured for slow transitions, with an automatic preset for cutscenes that changes how autoconvergence is configured (lower max limit and faster transitions). This preset also makes HUD be at screen depth for better subtitle readability. Also another preset that makes world map convergence be higher.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Installation&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- geo-11, with build v0.6.64: download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;Nioh2&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;nioh2.exe&amp;quot; is. Remember to edit &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot; to change your &amp;quot;direct_mode&amp;quot; to the output you need. For Geo-11 monitors, use &amp;quot;Geo-11_dx11&amp;quot; and preferably set &amp;quot;upscaling = 1&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;d3dxdm.ini&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;Geo-11_dx9&amp;quot; mode doesn&amp;#39;t work currently.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- (Geo-11 fix, outdated): download this file and extract its contents in the &amp;quot;Nioh2&amp;quot; folder, where &amp;quot;nioh2.exe&amp;quot; is.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Launch the game and let it overwrite the profile.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Do not use 1366x768 resolution specifically.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Recommendations&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- (Geo-11, old) Never disable 3D or alt+tab while playing unless you are in Geo-11 Ansel mode (paused game in photo mode). Doing that will make trees and grass desynchronize between the eyes.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Don&amp;#39;t use the ingame 120fps cap. It will make anything under 60fps run at lower speed than normal. Better use the 60fps cap.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- You can use borderless fullscreen and it will still trigger Geo-11. Just like exclusive fullscreen, but more alt+tab friendly (if you remember to use Ansel before doing that).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hotkeys&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F1: convergence presets (0, 1, 40, 80, 160, 240, 320). 320 by default. However, there are two or three missions that incorrectly trigger the low convergence preset because the depth of field shader is present. These presets don&amp;#39;t do anything when using autoconvergence (enabled by default).&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F2: HUD depth presets. 40% depth by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F3: HUD toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- F4: depth of field toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 5 (not the numpad): bloom toggle. Not disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 6 (not the numpad): vignette toggle. Disabled by default. A second press also disables radial blur in the dark realm. The third press turns all vignette and radial blur on again.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 7 (not the numpad): FXAA toggle. Disabled by default.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- 8 (not the numpad): screen space reflections quality toggle. Unmodified by default. This doesn&amp;#39;t control resolution. It increases the amount of geometry reflected. There is a performance cost when you use this, maybe 15-20% extra GPU usage.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- XB_LEFT_TRIGGER (holding it): this increases HUD depth to 85% when you hold it, intended for aiming with long range weapons. Not needed anymore.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked the fix and want to contribute for more future fixes, you can donate to this XXXX account: [&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:masterotakusuko@gmail.com\"&gt;masterotakusuko@gmail.com&lt;\\/a&gt;)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or you can join my XXXX: &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.XXXX.com\\/masterotaku&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vorpx G3D FullVR 4K&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/niohcomplete-edition\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\\/forums\\/topic\\/niohcomplete-edition\\/&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;or:&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reshade Depth3D 4K Virtual Reality Mod&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download\"&gt;https:\\/\\/reshade.me\\/#download&lt;\\/a&gt; Reshade with full Add-On Support, inclusive the complete Effect Package Depth3D BlueSkyDefender&lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/2.In\"&gt;2.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu activate SuperDepth3D_VR, follow instructions (Home-Key on keyboard for Menu)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/3.Download\"&gt;3.Download&lt;\\/a&gt; [&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/\"&gt;https:\\/\\/discord.gg\\/W2f7YhX\\/&lt;\\/a&gt; Generic_Depth_Mod.Addon64], copy it next to your Game.exe&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/4.In\"&gt;4.In&lt;\\/a&gt; the ingame Reshade menu install generic_depth_mod.addon64 (Add-On Tab)&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Launch Side by Side 3D on your 3D Compatible TV\\/Monitor + 3D Glasses or Install Vorpx Desktop Viewer &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com\"&gt;https:\\/\\/www.vorpx.com&lt;\\/a&gt; or Depth3D VR Companion App &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D\"&gt;https:\\/\\/github.com\\/BlueSkyDefender\\/Depth3D&lt;\\/a&gt; &lt;\\/li&gt;\n&lt;\\/ol&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Though from the outside looking in, it can often seem like a daunting task to just ask yourself \"How do I even get started?\" Undoubtedly for some, that very question will be the beginning and the end of their journey into VR as a means.  \n\n\nAnd so, I've put together this comprehensive timeline of how I got \"my foot in the door\" and the steps I took to go from absolutely zero experience (or even general, basic knowledge about the space at all) to working at an incredible studio that's making one of my favorite games. I will be giving my thoughts and sharing my beliefs about what led to certain moments, but I implore you to think for yourself here, and see how my situation might glean certain invaluable lessons, the fundamentals of which you can apply to your own specific needs.  \n\n\nI first became interested in VR way back in 2015-2016, though I was not able to invest any time or serious interest until several years later, when my financial state was well balanced enough as a laborer to grab the Quest as it released in 2019. Over the next two years I purchased a PC and also the Quest 2. I include this now as a foreword to grant some idea of context, though I do not include it in my timeline, as there was no earnest attempt nor thought in mind at this point of breaking into the industry. I just earnestly enjoyed the medium.  \n\n\nMy first \"break\" into the scene, (I admittedly at the time did not consider it as such) came when after playing some friendly matches, I decided to re-attend a playtest for Iron Rebellion, a game and community that I was quite active in. In these playtests they unveiled \"Bulletheim\" a player made community map built with blender by someone who had 0 prior experience. I was simply enraptured. A snowy tundra, scarred from the burdens of war, massive turrets littered the icy colored skyline filled the entirety of my virtual view. It felt amazing, it looked amazing, and it had been built by a player! Afterwards, I knew I had to try my hand at it, and with the support of a community that had gone from nothing to making real worlds, I felt I could reasonably do it. and thus begins what I consider to be DAY 1.  \n\n\n**Learning Blender**  \nAs with learning anything new, the first steps here were the most difficult. I spent hours and hours doing things that would now take me a matter of *seconds.* Though, those hours spent are, without question, the very same hours that allowed me to become more efficient and capable. I spent nearly every waking moment I could spare outside of work and personal requirements on this singular goal. To get good at blender. Certainly, this led to the extremely fast pace of progression for me, though it is important to note that I had the time and financial security to invest in myself at this point.   \nWithin a month I had gone from knowing nothing to making maps right alongside Bulletheim, the original map that had inspired me so much. I leaned heavily into relying on my peers, talented and capable as they were, and did my best to make the process as painless as possible for the devs, by keeping things very well organized and doing unrequired extras like lightmapping and testing in unity. I continued this process over the following three months, making a total of 6 maps, only two of which I felt were good enough for entry into the game.  \n\n\n[Two of my maps alongside Bulletheim](https:\\/\\/i.redd.it\\/b1ox3iivw1nb1.gif)\n\nAs I became more confident in my skills as a modeler and level designer, the thought would slowly begin to creep in, \"Could I do this professionally?\" I was still, after all, mostly a novice struggling from time to time with simple things, but that was lightyears ahead of where I was only a few months prior. I began to entertain the idea, and decided to continue with it as a goal.  \n\n\n**Luck and the power of being genuine**\n\nHowever, I did not anticipate that it would be the very studio that I was building things for that would approach me to ask if I wanted to work for them!  \n\n\nYou see, through the months that I had been working to make content for them, the devs and I had matured a sort of relationship. They knew me. They knew I cared for the game and the community, and unannounced to me at the time, had been considering hiring me for awhile. It was not that I actively tried to get them to hire me specifically, or that I was persistent in any way in this regard. Yet simply by trying to emulate what it would be like to work in a professional setting, and by being honest, kind, and genuine in my day to day interactions, it simply unfolded before me.  \n\n\nDo I think this will be the norm for all? Well, no. However, I think by taking the larger lessons and applying them to your situation, you may find your own path that you may have previously never knew existed.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWell that's pretty much my story, if you see me around posting about the good word of Iron Rebellion, I hope this adds some insight and context, but more importantly I hope this helps even just one person to reach out for their dreams, and start acting today like your moving to them. Who knows, it could be all you need to do!  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

He will also take care of saving the recording. \n\nFor capturing gameplay video and game (=output, bots speaking) audio, we tried using Pico casting which worked great. He easily fed that into the speakers so it's audible to the whole room.\n\nThings break when trying to capture the player's voice. The voice needs to be fed into a speech-to-text system which is part of the game (tracks in-game dialogue history).\n\n I tried various combinations on SteamVR (manual\\/headset\\/mirroring) but either all sound stopped working, or sound was playing everywhere but microphone wasn't captured, or if microphone wasn't captured it wasn't part of Pico casting.\n\nI'm thinking that maybe this just won't work, so I was thinking that maybe I can capture gameplay video directly on the PC (SteamVR has an option to view the game) and connect the speakers directly to the PC, but still have no idea what to do for the microphone. I saw some posts saying that Streaming Assistant is kinda broken when you want to both play and record audio at the same time, so I'm thinking maybe I should buy Virtual Desktop instead? Maybe try something fancy like Virtual Audio Cable (not that I have ever tried it)?\n\nI have no idea what I'm doing here, so any help &amp; tips are appreciated :(",

I feel like it would greatly benefit students in subjects like science, history, geography, geometry, etc. if they can fully immerse themselves into the lesson.\n\nCurrently, the most common ways to present a lesson is through PowerPoint. And so I was wondering if there is a software\\/app out there similar to PowerPoint but for VR. One where the presentor can prepare slides(or if maybe in VR it can be a scene) and add visual elements like texts, images, videos, 3D objects, landscape, particles, etc. then give the presentor control over the presentation and all the VR devices in the room are synced.\n\nAlso, like a PowerPoint file, it would be awesome if the presentation can be easily shared as one file and can be edited.\n\nIf you know what I'm looking for, please do share! \\ud83d\\ude01",

I feel like it would greatly benefit students in subjects like science, history, geography, geometry, etc. if they can fully immerse themselves into the lesson.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, the most common ways to present a lesson is through PowerPoint. And so I was wondering if there is a software\\/app out there similar to PowerPoint but for VR. One where the presentor can prepare slides(or if maybe in VR it can be a scene) and add visual elements like texts, images, videos, 3D objects, landscape, particles, etc. then give the presentor control over the presentation and all the VR devices in the room are synced.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, like a PowerPoint file, it would be awesome if the presentation can be easily shared as one file and can be edited.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you know what I&amp;#39;m looking for, please do share! \\ud83d\\ude01&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

            "selftext": "Through the years I've owned multiple headsets, however I never once before did I even consider a Pimax headset because of the many bad stories I've seen written in the past in various forums. Still, as a primarily sim racing VR user, when the Pimax Crystal was announced I simply couldn't avoid becoming invested in what the headset had to offer, and in the end I decided to pre-order,  notwithstanding my reservations.  \nWhen my unit arrived I was very positively reassured by the fact that the Crystal was recognized immediately and all worked fine in my system, as I was expecting instead to have to dabble a little to have it work (as for many early testers connectivity issues were a problem). Since I couldn't resist I also tried immediately (without even adjusting other settings) to play Assetto Corsa and see how it looked. I think it is not a surprise to anyone at this point that I was blown away at the clarity and colors. I even tried the Aero in the past but the Crystal was better. I just did a couple of laps but then I started to experience a little discomfort and had to quit. Stupid me - I jumped immediately on using the headset without adjusting the IPD, so that's bound to happen. And then, I noticed, and my hearth sunk... When I tried to change the IPD the lenses didn't move. The motor worked but the lenses were stuck. Alas, my unit was faulty.  \n\n\nNow I started to panic as all the bad experiences I had heard in the past suddenly became a prophecy of what was going to happen to myself also. I was surely going to wait 6 months to have the unit back, and who knows what other shenanigans I was going to endure. I really didn't want to go through that, so I tried to use the headset as it was, but alas the difference in IPD was too large as it was stuck to 72mm while my IPD is 64mm, hence I couldn't go past 30 minutes before feeling discomfort and if I pushed too far the result was a bad headache. I use VR for stints of over 2 hours at a time and there was no way I could use the Crystal in such a way. There was no way out of it: the only solution for me was to RMA.  \n\n\n**THE RMA PROCESS**\n\nI contacted support, and once again, surprisingly enough (as I've heard you had to wait quite a while before a reply), someone replied to my ticked in less than a day. I explained the issue and linked them a video where I did shown that the lenses were stuck. They asked me a couple other questions and then they gave me an address in Europe where I had to send my faulty unit back. When the faulty unit was picked up by the recipient I was then, in less than a week, sent a new Crystal. All the process took 18 days, most of which were spent sending the unit back through the postal office. The new unit I received was even personally tested before sending it back to me.   \n\n\nOverall, I was very impressed once again by how smooth the process went. There were indeed some times where I didn't know precisely what to do (as when the package arrived at the destination and I didn't know if the recipient was aware of where to go pick it) and support was a little late on assisting me, but even there in the Discord channel there are many Pimax reps that will help you in case you come into trouble, so the support experience was infinitely better than I anticipated it would be, given the histories I read about in the past. I'm not saying those stories weren't true, much probably things were truly a nightmare in the past concerning support and especially the RMA process, but things have greatly improved nowadays, or at least in my case they surely were.  \n\n\n  \n**THE PIMAX CRYSTAL EXPERIENCE**\n\nNow, about the Crystal itself: **image quality wise** nothing comes close to it, period. Even more than when I first used it the clarity difference became apparent during my RMA time, when after using the Crystal for a couple of days I had to go back to my G2. Truly the difference was outstanding. It was really difficult for me to use the G2 at that point, as everything seemed blurry in comparison. However be aware that there are chromatic aberrations present given the aspheric lenses: in normal scenarios they are barely noticeable (if at all), however in certain instances (especially when text or UI are present) you will notice it and for some people it can be more distracting than for others.   \n\n\n**Comfort:** I have a narrow shape face so it was difficult at first to adapt to the headset, as the Crystal is more suited for large faces, however with some little DIY with the face gasket I was able to adapt it to better fit my face shape and to not have light leakages. Still it would be wonderful if Pimax would develop in the future a gasket better suited for those with a narrower face shape as myself. The weight wasn't really an issue for me as even if bulky the headset is really well distributed weight wise so if the front fits well you will have no issues. Furthermore nowadays there are quite a few accessories that can turn the Crystal into actually one of the most comfortable headsets to wear, and Pimax is also devising a new head-strap of their own for such a purpose.   \n\n\n**Tracking:** one of the most often repeated slogans for the Crystal is that it's a \"simmer headset\". While it is true that the Crystal is greatly suited for sim racing given its clarity I sincerely reject the nomenclature as it gives the impression that the headset is good only under such a scenario, but that's not the case at all. While controller tracking was really bad at first it has really improved recently and the visual clarity and colors of the Crystal really shine under multiple scenarios. In fact, given that sim racing titles are not for the most part very appealing to the eyes, you often cannot even reach the best impact image wise that the Crystal can achieve with them only. So no, the Crystal is absolutely not just a \"simmer headset\" as even its very good vertical FOV is actually best suited for full room scale game scenarios.  \n\n\n**Battery:** probably one of the most discussed aspect of the headset and one that I surely wasn't happy about myself in the beginning. In fact I'm not 100% happy about it even now but things have vastly improved on this aspect as time went on and nowadays we have arrived at a state in which you don't even really notice you have a battery at all in 99% of case scenarios. The battery lasts for about 8 hours of usage and it recharges by itself when idle. The only way you will ever notice you have a battery at all is if you will play a game continuously for more than 6 hours at a time and I sincerely don't know many people that really do that, if not for testing purposes. Now it remains to be seen, however, how the natural degradation of batteries will work, but apart from that most of the people will know they are using a battery just because they had to insert one at first to have the headset work.  \n\n\n**Modularity:** This is one of the things Pimax invested on with the Crystal and that at first backfired quite a bit as it made the headset feel much more like a beta than a full released product. Many were also not quite sure if Pimax would ever even fulfil on the promises they made about the various modular designs. With the upcoming light-house faceplace much of the insecurity on the matter by the user base has been appeased. I'm still personally on the fence on the usability of the Crystal as an AIO headset but I suppose we will see how that will pan out.   \n\n\n**SUMMARY**  \n\n\nBeing the Crystal my very first Pimax headset I was really scared in the beginning on pre-ordering it. When I discovered the problem with the IPD mechanism I really thought that my worst nightmare was about to become a reality but instead everything worked out wonderfully in the end. While there are still aspects in the support that Pimax should really invest more (especially on the timing), my RMA went very smoothly and the experience with the headset itself is improving day by day. The firmware is improving constantly and the Crystal is now at a very stable point. Many of the quirks in both the hardware and software has been worked out in these months and Pimax seems to be fulfilling their part of the bargain for what it concerns the modularity. We will see what the future has to offer but I'm very happy to have gone through my pre-order. However still remember that the Crystal is a very powerful headset so don't expect a plug and play experience in all the titles, even with a 4090. If you buy such an expensive headset with this high resolution you must expect to thinker a little with the settings to have the most enjoyable experience with games.   \n\\- ",

Everything works really seamlessly now too, tracking of monitors is consistent.\n\nI've been utilising the app to work from a standing desk of sorts. And I've been using it for hours at a time, for multiple days in a row. I've made a custom mod, adding padding and a portable battery to the back of the strap. I work wireless, with a dedicated wifi 6 router plugged into the PC for just the headset.\n\nI think Apple are on the right track. But I think the Quest 3 might have the resolution bump needed to push this ideal beyond early adopters, without breaking the bank.\n\nHow many other early adopters are there? Am I a weirdo? Or are lots of you working in VR too? What apps do you recommend and do you have any tips? Do you think \"spatial computing\" is the future?",

Everything works really seamlessly now too, tracking of monitors is consistent.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been utilising the app to work from a standing desk of sorts. And I&amp;#39;ve been using it for hours at a time, for multiple days in a row. I&amp;#39;ve made a custom mod, adding padding and a portable battery to the back of the strap. I work wireless, with a dedicated wifi 6 router plugged into the PC for just the headset.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think Apple are on the right track. But I think the Quest 3 might have the resolution bump needed to push this ideal beyond early adopters, without breaking the bank.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many other early adopters are there? Am I a weirdo? Or are lots of you working in VR too? What apps do you recommend and do you have any tips? Do you think &amp;quot;spatial computing&amp;quot; is the future?&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The colors in general are a lot more vibrant too. \n\nSadly this came with the price of lower resolution. This is specially noticeable in games where there is a hud near your face or text to read (such as Subnautica) but so far for first person games where there is no hud, I think the experience is far superior. \n\nI am really loking forward for the new headsets with Microled.

The colors in general are a lot more vibrant too. &lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly this came with the price of lower resolution. This is specially noticeable in games where there is a hud near your face or text to read (such as Subnautica) but so far for first person games where there is no hud, I think the experience is far superior. &lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am really loking forward for the new headsets with Microled. The Bigscreen headset looks promising. For now there are tradeoffs for both types of headsets it seems. I will continue using both for now, since for many games the Q2 it is still the preferable option.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The raw data for the first few months are [here](https:\\/\\/www.reddit.com\\/r\\/virtualreality\\/comments\\/128cnqx\\/calories_burned_what_sorcery_is_this\\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) . For the next few months after that, I was burning 13k calories in April, 11k calories in May and 10k calories in June. The reduced burn was due to a combination of increased work load, sickness and of course, I have to return to the army as a reservist at the start of July, so I rested for some days in June.\n\nAnyway, I decided to test yesterday to see if I can pass my fitness test while in the army with nothing but my VR exercises to back me up. For the context, the fitness test I had to take consists of sit-ups, push-ups and a 2.4km run. I've been excused from the push-ups due to a past injury.\n\nBefore VR, I could do 40 sit-ups in 1 minute and about 14 plus minutes for my 2.4km run. That's optimally with months of conventional training.\n\nYesterday, I was able to do 31 sit-ups on my first try. This one was my first estimate as the machine doing the counting was malfunctioning and miscounted. What's interesting is that I was able to do 29 sit-ups on second try. I'd never have the stamina do even try a second time.\n\nFor my 2.4km run, I clocked in at 13 minutes and 21 seconds, a huge improvement compared to before. So basically, I passed my fitness test.\n\nA possible explanation for all this is that VR helps me to shed some weight by the boatload. I'm 10kg lighter than I was last year, at my worst. This by itself could account for the increased speed, but the exercises I did in VR was also stamina-based. Killing dozens of gladiators in Blade and Sorcery without resting is really tiring, after all, and with a spear, I could survive for up to 38 minutes 1v1. With swords, I couldn't survive for as long, maybe 20 minutes, but swords are more tiring to use.\n\nThe downside I discovered with VR is that it couldn't really train your core muscles very well. Before VR,  I could easily do 35 reps in sit-up with just a couple of months' conventional training. 3-4 months of conventional training gives me 40. 5-6 months of VR training got me 31-32 at best. The only muscles being trained in VRs are my arms and legs, I think, so I won't be getting six-packs anytime soon.\n\ntl;dr VR exercises are good for stamina training and losing weight, but couldn't really training your core muscles well. With just VR exercises, it is possible to pass a military fitness test with most of your score coming from stamina-based activities like a 2.4km run.\n\nEdit: spelling and a wee bit more info",

I am happy to announce \"Magic Kaleidoscope\" \n This is NOT VR, It can stand alone, but is designed to be used with the VR version of the same named game\\/animated texture generator. For \"Magic Kaleidoscope VR\" which is already done, however, we need to prepare the Steam page and pass the test. Both versions will be better to use together. (Can be used separately)  \n\nSo, it will be better if you just look at how it looks on the page and you will understand everything yourself.  And I'm already tired of translating this text into English :)\n\n... P.s. we're really glad we finished this thing and it's really cool as the gameplay is immersive. \n\nPps. there will also be a demo so you can try.\n\nRegards , Valerii  (SilverCord-VR team)",

I'm currently conducting research into VR use, and would like to thank the mod team for responding positively to my enquiries about advertising an ongoing study on the subreddit.\n\nThe study is looking at 'Suspension of Disbelief' in the context of Virtual Reality Environments, and is exploring the hypothesis that varying abilities to suspend disbelief exist and are able to predict how 'present' one feels when using immersive VREs. Over the next month, I'm hoping to recruit as many VR users as possible to fill out a short survey - consisting of our new scale designed to measure suspension of disbelief, and two-previously existing standardised measures - about their recent virtual reality use. All together, it should take roughly 15 minutes to complete. You will also, should you choose to participate, not be required to submit any biographical or personally identifying information, beyond a unique identifier of your choosing.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not able to record data from those under the age of 18, nor am I able to offer any sort of reward or incentive for participation in this study (beyond my professional gratitude). However if you want to contribute to ongoing research in an area of VR technologies that has applications across the entertainment, healthcare, and space industries, I would like to invite you to consult the following link. [Here you will find additional information about the study, contact details for myself and other staff at York St John University, and the ability to complete the survey.](https:\\/\\/yorksj.eu.qualtrics.com\\/jfe\\/form\\/SV_cOMkPpb41OMtImG)\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Please reach out via DM or email if you wish for more information. Please note that this reddit account and my listed email address (which you can find in the study link) will both be deleted by the end of August 2023, so any correspondence we have had will be removed, further protecting your privacy.\n\nKindly,Rachel Bradley, BSc (Hons) | School of Education, Language, &amp; Psychology | York St John University",

My name is Rachel Bradley, and I&amp;#39;m a postgraduate psychology researcher studying at York St John Univeristy, UK. I&amp;#39;m currently conducting research into VR use, and would like to thank the mod team for responding positively to my enquiries about advertising an ongoing study on the subreddit.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The study is looking at &amp;#39;Suspension of Disbelief&amp;#39; in the context of Virtual Reality Environments, and is exploring the hypothesis that varying abilities to suspend disbelief exist and are able to predict how &amp;#39;present&amp;#39; one feels when using immersive VREs. Over the next month, I&amp;#39;m hoping to recruit as many VR users as possible to fill out a short survey - consisting of our new scale designed to measure suspension of disbelief, and two-previously existing standardised measures - about their recent virtual reality use. All together, it should take roughly 15 minutes to complete. You will also, should you choose to participate, not be required to submit any biographical or personally identifying information, beyond a unique identifier of your choosing.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we are not able to record data from those under the age of 18, nor am I able to offer any sort of reward or incentive for participation in this study (beyond my professional gratitude). However if you want to contribute to ongoing research in an area of VR technologies that has applications across the entertainment, healthcare, and space industries, I would like to invite you to consult the following link. &lt;a href=\"https:\\/\\/yorksj.eu.qualtrics.com\\/jfe\\/form\\/SV_cOMkPpb41OMtImG\"&gt;Here you will find additional information about the study, contact details for myself and other staff at York St John University, and the ability to complete the survey.&lt;\\/a&gt;&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time and consideration. Please reach out via DM or email if you wish for more information. Please note that this reddit account and my listed email address (which you can find in the study link) will both be deleted by the end of August 2023, so any correspondence we have had will be removed, further protecting your privacy.&lt;\\/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kindly,Rachel Bradley, BSc (Hons) | School of Education, Language, &amp;amp; Psychology | York St John University&lt;\\/p&gt;\n&lt;\\/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
